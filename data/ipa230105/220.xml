The present application claims priorities from PCT Application No. PCT/CN2020/084091, filed Apr. 10, 2020, and from the Chinese Patent Application No. 202010183292.2, filed to the CNIPA on Mar. 16, 2020, titled &#x201c;Gun-Shaped Ear Piercer&#x201d;, which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the technical field of auxiliary ornament mounting devices, in particular to a gun-shaped ear piercer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spring-driven gun-shaped ear piercers, with similar components such as a piercer body, a stud mounting portion and a stud base mounting portion, have been around for a long time. In a process of ear piercing, the stud mounting portion and the stud base mounting portion are firstly brought closer to the earlobe, and then a trigger releases a pre-compressed spring, so that the spring drives the stud mounting portion to move forward, and a tip of a stud is pierced into a stud base after piercing through the earlobe. Then the stud mounting portion and the stud base mounting portion are separated from each other and detached from the body of the gun-shaped ear piercer at the same time, leaving the stud and the stud base on the earlobe. In this way, the entire ear piercing process is completed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, in the process of ear piercing, in order to avoid the pain caused by piercing the ears twice respectively, two piercers generally needs to aim at the earlobes on both sides for positioning, and then triggers are pulled to release firing springs at the same time, so that the ear piercing operation on both sides can be carried out at the same time, ensuring that customers will get pain only once, reducing customer's discomfort and improving customer experience.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In existing gun-shaped ear piercers, the stud base mounting portion is driven to get close to the stud mounting portion by pulling the trigger (the stud mounting portion keeps still while the stud base mounting portion moves closer), and the firing spring is released by triggering when the stud base mounting portion further moves to a certain position. Such structure is not conducive to keeping the first gun-shaped ear piercer still after this piercer aims at the earlobe, and false triggering occurs easily.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve this problem, in the prior art, the stud base mounting portion is driven to get close to the stud mounting portion by pulling the trigger (the stud mounting portion keeps still while the stud base mounting portion moves closer), and then the firing spring is unlocked by the thumb. With this design, the requirement of keeping the first gun-shaped ear piercer still after this piercer aims at the earlobe can be met to avoid false triggering. However, triggering by the thumb will cause a large hand motion, which easily makes the position of the first gun-shaped ear piercer held by hand deviate from a piercing position, and thus results in an offset piercing position on the ear.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the technical problem to be solved in the present application is to provide a gun-shaped ear piercer, which can reduce the finger motion amplitude of operators in the process of ear piercing and improve the accuracy and efficiency of ear piercing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the above problems, a gun-shaped ear piercer is provided according to the present application, comprising a front portion and a rear portion, which are sleeved together and can move relatively;

A track <b>7</b>, having a front slot <b>7</b><i>a </i>for mounting a stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> disposed on one end thereof away from the rear portion <b>2</b>, as well as a fixed portion <b>11</b> for mounting a stud mounting portion <b>10</b> disposed thereon in a sliding manner, is disposed on the front portion <b>1</b>. A firing device corresponding to the fixed portion <b>11</b> is disposed on the rear portion <b>2</b>. The front portion <b>1</b> includes a grip having an unlocking trigger <b>6</b> disposed on a front side thereof, an elastic reset device as well as an aiming stroke restrainer are disposed between the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b>, the aiming stroke restrainer is configured to restrain the firing device from moving to an aimed position when firing device is in an aiming stroke, and the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is configured to trigger the firing device to enter an piercing stroke for piercing the earlobe.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> of the gun-shaped ear piercer are reset by the elastic reset device, and the aiming stroke is confined by the aiming stroke restrainer, so that the gun-shaped ear piercer can stably be stopped at the aimed position after entering the aiming stroke to meet the requirement of keeping a first ear piercer that aims at the earlobe still, and the firing device is triggered by the separate unlocking trigger <b>6</b> to enter the piercing stroke to make a stud <b>10</b><i>a </i>pierce through the earlobe. Since the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is located at a front side of the grip of the front portion <b>1</b>, the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> when pulled may be held and triggered by other fingers except the thumb. Slight hand motion may effectively avoid the problem that the first ear piercer deviates from a piercing position in the process of triggering with the thumb, and ensure that two gun-shaped ear piercers operate at the same time to make the piercing position more accurate and hardly deviate from the piercing position, thus improving the convenience and accuracy of ear piercing operations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The gun-shaped ear piercer according to the present application is of a gun-shaped structure, in which the stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> and the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> are mounted on a gun barrel of the front portion <b>1</b>, thus piercing the ears easily. The grip according to the present application is formed on a gun handle, where the grip consists of two portions, namely a grip of the front portion <b>1</b> and a grip of the rear portion <b>2</b> which are sleeved together to form a complete grip. Since the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>, with its position similar to that of a trigger of a gun, is disposed on the grip of the front portion <b>1</b>, the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> when pulled may be operated directly by the index finger in the same way as the gun, so that the unlocking trigger may be pulled more smoothly and ergonomically. Moreover, the motion of the index finger is only to pull the trigger slightly, so the motion is relatively slight, which can keep the overall stability and balance of the gun-shaped ear piercer and thus effectively ensure the accuracy and reliability of the ear piercing operation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The elastic reset device is disposed between the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> to ensure that the two portions may be kept away from a predetermined position without external force, so that the firing device on the rear portion <b>2</b> is kept away from a position where the stud <b>10</b><i>a </i>is located before the operation of the gun-shaped ear piercer starts, which facilitates operations such as mounting the stud <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and can reserve the movable space required for a next aiming stroke at the same time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present application, the elastic reset device includes a handle return spring <b>8</b> with one end connected to the front portion <b>1</b> and the other end connected to the rear portion <b>2</b>, so that the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> are connected together to form a complete gun-shaped structure. A spring sleeve, in which the handle return spring <b>8</b> is sleeved and fixed, is disposed on the rear portion <b>2</b>, and a spring link, to which the handle return spring <b>8</b> is connected, is disposed on the front portion <b>1</b>. When the handle spring <b>8</b> is in a naturally extended state, the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> are sleeved together and partially overlap, so that the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> can be integrated without falling out of a sleeve. The front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> can be directly held to close when needed. After overcoming the elastic action of the handle spring <b>8</b>, the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> are closed, with an overlapped portion thereof enlarging and the overall width of a holding portion reducing. In this case, the handle return spring <b>8</b> has an elastic force to expand outward, so when the external force disappears, the handle return spring <b>8</b> can spring the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> apart, making the two restore the initial state.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The track <b>7</b> is fixedly disposed on the front portion <b>1</b>. The track <b>7</b> may be designed and machined separately from and then fixedly connected to the front portion <b>1</b>, or may be directly molded on the front portion <b>1</b>. The front slot <b>7</b><i>a </i>is disposed at one end of the track <b>7</b>, and the fixed portion <b>11</b> is disposed at the other end. A fixed portion slot <b>11</b><i>a</i>, on which the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> is fixedly disposed, is disposed on the fixed portion <b>11</b>. The fixed portion <b>11</b> is disposed on the track <b>7</b> in a sliding manner, so as to adjust its relative position with the front slot <b>7</b><i>a</i>. Because of the relative movement thereof, the fixed portion <b>11</b> and the front slot <b>7</b><i>a </i>can be configured to respectively mount the stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> and the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> which are separated. Compared with a cassette design in which the stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> and the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> are integrated, the separated structure is less costly to design and manufacture, but requires higher machining accuracy to ensure that the stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> and the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> are in place at the same time. The above mounting structure of the front slot <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the fixed portion <b>11</b> also applies to the cassette in which the stud base mounting portion <b>9</b> and the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> are integrated.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A spring locking piece <b>5</b>, which is disposed on a firing path of the firing device for locking the firing device, is disposed in the rear portion <b>2</b>, and the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is in drive connection with spring locking piece <b>5</b> to drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b> to unlock the firing device. The unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is disposed on the front portion <b>1</b>, the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is disposed on the rear portion <b>2</b>, the spring locking piece <b>5</b> needs to keep the firing device locked all the time before the firing device reaches the aimed position, and the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> needs to drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b> to unlock the firing device locked by the spring locking piece <b>5</b> after the firing device reaches the aimed position to ensure that the firing device can fire the stud <b>10</b><i>a</i>, so the driving relation between the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> and the spring locking piece <b>5</b> may be set in such way that the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> cannot drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b> if the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> and the spring locking piece <b>5</b> do not reach a driving position before the firing device reaches the aimed position. The driving relation may also be set in such way that a drive structure may be formed between the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> and the spring locking piece <b>5</b> before the firing device reaches the aimed position, but the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is limited by other structures and thus cannot drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b>. Only when the firing device reaches the aimed position will the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> be released by limiting structures. Only in this case, the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> can drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b>. Such structure can effectively avoid the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> from falsely triggering the spring locking piece <b>5</b>, and improve the operation safety, reliability and accuracy of the gun-shaped ear piercer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present application, the spring locking piece <b>5</b> may be rotatably disposed on the rear portion <b>2</b>, a torsion spring <b>5</b><i>a </i>for returning the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is disposed between the spring locking piece <b>5</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b>, and the spring locking piece <b>5</b> includes a locking end <b>5</b><i>c </i>configured to lock the firing device and a triggering end <b>5</b><i>b </i>configured to unlock together with the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>. The spring locking piece <b>5</b> is similar to a lever structure, with a center section thereof mounted on the rear portion <b>2</b> through the torsion spring <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and the torque of the torsion spring <b>5</b><i>a </i>provides a locking force for locking the firing device. One end of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> forms a stop end that may be clamped on the firing path of the firing device to lock the firing device, while the other end thereof may form a driving relation with the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> after the firing device reaches the aimed position, and the firing device is unlocked under the drive of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a </i>is disposed on the top of the rear portion <b>2</b>, the firing device includes a firing pin <b>3</b> and a firing spring <b>4</b>, which are mounted in the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and both ends of the firing spring <b>4</b> are elastically propped against the firing pin <b>3</b> and the firing spring <b>4</b> respectively. A strip-shaped notch <b>2</b><i>b</i>, below which the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is disposed, is disposed below the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and the locking end <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> extends into the notch <b>2</b><i>b </i>to lock the firing device together with the firing pin <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>is disposed on the firing pin <b>3</b>, and the locking end <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is snapped into the ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>when the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is locked, and is detached from the ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>when the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is unlocked. The ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>may also be a recess, provided that the locking end <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> can be snapped into the recess to stop the firing pin <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The firing pin <b>3</b> includes a major-diameter section disposed at a front end thereof, as well as a minor-diameter section disposed at a rear end thereof and coming out from the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>, the ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>is disposed at the major-diameter section, one end of the firing spring <b>4</b> is propped against one end of the major-diameter section connected to the minor-diameter section, while the other end thereof is propped against an end wall of the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>. The firing pin <b>3</b> is of a structure in which the major-diameter section and the minor-diameter section are fitted to each other, which may form a stop step by different diameters of the major-diameter section and the minor-diameter section, so that one end of the firing spring <b>4</b> may be stopped on the stop step while the other end thereof may be stopped on the end wall of the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>. A hole, through which the minor-diameter section partially comes out of the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>, is formed on the end wall of the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>, so that the firing pin <b>3</b> may be operated easily by the minor-diameter section. After firing, the firing pin <b>3</b> can be returned to its original position by operating the minor-diameter section, and the spring locking piece <b>5</b> can be snapped into the ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the firing pin <b>3</b> again, thus locking the firing pin <b>3</b> for the next piercing operation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A tail hook <b>3</b><i>a </i>suitable for holding is disposed on a tail of the firing pin <b>3</b> coming out of the hollow tube <b>2</b><i>a</i>. In practice, an eye splice may also be mounted on the tail hook <b>3</b><i>a</i>, so that the tail hook <b>3</b><i>a </i>can be pulled back more easily. When the tail hook <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pulled back and the firing pin <b>3</b> moves back to press the firing spring <b>4</b> to a certain position, the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is snapped into the ring groove <b>3</b><i>b </i>on the firing pin <b>3</b> to tighten the firing spring <b>4</b>, so that the firing pin <b>3</b> is in a state to be fired. When the firing pin <b>3</b> moves back to be fired, the stud mounting portion <b>10</b> is inserted into the fixed portion slot <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the fixed portion <b>11</b>, and the firing pin <b>3</b> is just aimed at the stud <b>10</b><i>a </i>in an elastic track <b>10</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A mounting groove, having the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> disposed therein, is disposed on a front side of the grip of the front portion <b>1</b>, a first end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is hinged to the front portion <b>1</b> and connected to the front portion <b>1</b> through a torsion spring <b>6</b><i>a</i>, while a second end thereof is blocked on an inner wall of the front portion <b>1</b>. A trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>is disposed on the top of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>, and a side catch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is disposed on at least one side of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>; and a straight slot <b>2</b><i>h </i>is disposed on a lower side of the rear portion <b>2</b>, the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>is at least partially disposed in the straight slot <b>2</b><i>h</i>, and the side catch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is blocked outside the straight slot <b>2</b><i>h</i>. The mounting groove is located at the front side of the grip, and its position is similar to that of a trigger of a pistol, allowing a more pistol-like structure and easier manual operations. The first end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is hinged to the front portion <b>1</b>, while the second end thereof is in a cantilever position and pressed against the inner wall of the front portion <b>1</b> under the elastic action of the torsion spring <b>6</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, before being operated by hand, the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> will not trigger the spring locking piece <b>5</b> under the elastic action of the torsion spring <b>6</b><i>a </i>to release the spring locking piece <b>5</b>. The first end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is hinged, and is provided with an arc-shaped structure at an end, which can provide a larger space for the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> to rotate without interference with the front portion <b>1</b>, and thus more effectively ensure that the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> has enough release ability and larger moving range to release the spring locking piece <b>5</b> effectively.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, a hook is disposed at an end of the second end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>, and an overhead hook is further disposed at a position where a wall of the mounting groove of the front portion <b>1</b> is fitted to the second end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b>. The hook of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is hooked to the overhead hook under the action of the torsion spring <b>6</b><i>a</i>, thus effectively preventing the second end of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> from falling out of the mounting groove, and improving the stability and reliability of the mounting structure of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> in the front portion <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, the side catch <b>6</b><i>b </i>is disposed on the side of the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c</i>. The side catch <b>6</b><i>b </i>are disposed on both sides of the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>respectively, which can ensure that the wall of the straight slot <b>2</b><i>h </i>uniformly blocks the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c</i>. The trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>is provided to ensure that the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> only partially enters the straight slot <b>2</b><i>h</i>, and a raised structure of the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>forms a driving relation with the spring locking piece <b>5</b> more easily, so as to trigger and release the spring locking piece <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f </i>protruding towards the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is further disposed on the lower side of the rear portion <b>2</b>, the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is disposed at a rear side of the blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f</i>. Before the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> are completely closed, the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is located at the blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f</i>, and the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is pressed against the inner wall of the front portion <b>1</b> by the blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f</i>. After the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> are completely closed, the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> is staggered from the blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f</i>, the side catch <b>6</b><i>b </i>passes over the protruded blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f </i>and is fitted to the triggering end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b>. In this case, the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> can fully rotate to a proper position, and the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> can drive the triggering end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> to move and in turn drive the spring locking piece <b>5</b> to rotate, so that the locking end <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is dislocated from a locked position to unlock the firing device and release the firing spring <b>4</b>, so as to complete the firing process.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f </i>is shorter than the aiming stroke in length, so that the trigger boss <b>6</b><i>c </i>of the unlocking trigger <b>6</b> can completely stagger from the blocking piece <b>2</b><i>f </i>and reaches a position where the spring locking piece <b>5</b> is located after the aiming stroke is finished, so as to unlock the spring locking piece <b>5</b> in time and effectively.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The rear portion <b>2</b> is sleeved in the front portion <b>1</b>, and the aiming stroke restrainer includes stop pins disposed on the front portion <b>1</b>, and stop grooves disposed on the rear portion <b>2</b>. The stop pins are disposed on an upper portion and a lower portion of a fitting portion of the front portion <b>1</b> and the rear portion <b>2</b> respectively, and the stop grooves are disposed at corresponding positions of the rear portion <b>2</b>, and the stroke of the stop pin in the stop groove is the aiming stroke.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Specifically, the front portion <b>1</b> includes a front piece <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a rear piece <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which are spliced to form the front portion <b>1</b>.
