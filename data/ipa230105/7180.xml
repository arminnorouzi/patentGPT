adopted to synthesize the optical zoom of a mobile phone camera. This results in discontinuities in pictures during switching of the focal lengths, which affects the user experience and the video effect. Moreover, since the angle-of-view of the multiple camera modules are fixed, it can only switch towards the centers of the angles of view of the cameras with different focal length ranges, and it is impossible to perform smooth zoom switching at any point in a picture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure provides a zoom control method, an apparatus and a medium.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect of examples of the disclosure, a zoom control method is provided, including: determining a midpoint of a connecting line of touch points located on both sides of an object to be close-up; determining a pixel vector formed from the midpoint of the connecting line to a center point of a screen; converting the pixel vector into an angle vector based on a conversion relationship between a diagonal angle of view of a current focal length range and a diagonal pixel of an image sensor of a camera system; and controlling the object to be close-up being moved to the center point of the screen based on the angle vector.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a second aspect of examples of the disclosure, a zoom control apparatus is provided, including: one or more processors; and one or more memories configured to store instructions executable for the processor.

When the following description refers to the accompanying drawings, unless otherwise indicated, the same numbers in different drawings represent the same or similar elements. The implementation described in the following examples do not represent all implementations consistent with the disclosure. Rather, they are merely examples of apparatuses and methods consistent with some aspects of the disclosure as detailed in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flowchart of a zoom control method according to an example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the zoom control method is applied to a mobile terminal, and includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In step S<b>11</b>, a midpoint of a connecting line of touch points located on both sides of an object to be close-up is determined.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The object to be close-up may be any object that needs to be close-up, such as portraits, flowers and plants, animals, and scenery.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When taking a photo with the mobile terminal, if a user intends to take a close-up shot on a certain object in the screen, the user may touch both sides of the object to be close-up simultaneously with two fingers, and a center position of the connecting line of the two touch points is determined as a position for close-up.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In step S<b>12</b>, a pixel vector formed from the midpoint of the connecting line to a center point of a screen is determined.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">That is, a vector index is formed from the midpoint of the connecting line of the touch points to the center point of the screen, and the unit of the vector index is a pixel.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step S<b>13</b>, based on a conversion relationship between a diagonal angle of view of a current focal length range and a diagonal pixel of an image sensor of a camera system, the pixel vector is converted into an angle vector.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, the conversion relationship between the diagonal angle of view of the current focal length range and the diagonal pixel of the image sensor of the camera system may be:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">the diagonal angle/the diagonal pixel=2*tan{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}&#x2212;1 (the size of the half-image height of the image sensor/current focal length range)/the number of diagonal pixels.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The size of the half-image height of the image sensor refers to a half of a diagonal size of the image sensor. For example, for a 35-mm equivalent camera, the size of the half-image height of the image sensor is 21.65 mm.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By means of the conversion relationship, the pixel vector in the unit of pixel can be converted into the angle vector in the unit of degree.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step S<b>14</b>, the object to be close-up is controlled to move to the center point of the screen based on the angle vector.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">By adopting the above technical solution, the pixel vector from the midpoint of the connecting line of the touch points to the center point of the screen can be converted into the angle vector, and the angle vector is used to control the object to be close-up to move to the center point of the screen, as a result, the switch between the scene and the close-up in the picture can be more flexible without manually moving the object to be close-up to the center of the screen picture and then conducting optical zooming, so that the discontinuity of pictures during focal length switching is avoided, and a function of optical zooming for any point in a full picture cannot be limited to a minimum focal length picture, but an optical zooming effect on any position in the full picture can be easily achieved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The zoom control method according to the examples of the disclosure can be applied to any camera system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic top view of an example of the camera system applicable to the zoom control method according to examples of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic front view of an example of the camera system applicable to the zoom control method according to examples of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the camera system includes two groups of uniaxial rotatable prisms and an optical zoom camera module. Twice the total uniaxial rotation angle of the prisms shall be greater than an angle difference between a diagonal angle of view of a picture with a minimum optical zoom ratio and a diagonal angle of view of a picture with a maximum optical zoom ratio. For example, the prism, a reflective surface of which may rotate +/&#x2212;10 degrees, is matched with the optical zoom camera module, the diagonal angle of view of the picture with the minimum ratio of which is 80 degrees and the diagonal angle of view of the picture with the maximum ratio of which is 40 degrees, so as to form the camera system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, under the condition of using a prism by a light deflection component of the camera system, the step S<b>14</b> that the object to be close-up is controlled to move to the center point of the screen based on the angle vector may include the following steps: based on a corresponding relationship between a moving angle of the screen picture and a rotation angle of the prism, the angle vector is converted into the rotation angle of the prism, and the angle vector indicates the moving angle of the screen picture; and the rotation of the prism is controlled based on the rotation angle, so as to control the object to be close-up being moved to the center point of the screen.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The angle vector indicates the moving angle of the screen picture; this means that the degree of the screen picture will move depending on the degree of the angle vector.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Since the rotation of the prism will drive the screen picture to rotate, there is a corresponding relationship between the rotation angle of the prism and the rotation angle of the screen picture. For example, if the reflective surface of the prism rotates, the screen picture of the mobile terminal will change two degrees as the reflective surface of the prism rotates one degree. In this case, in order to move the object to be close-up to the center point of the screen, the rotation angle of the prism needs to be a half of the angle vector. In this way, the object to be close-up in the picture is moved to the center of the screen picture.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are schematic diagrams of movement of a zoom center by taking the camera system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as an example. First, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, both sides of the object to be close-up are touched with two fingers, so that the object to be close-up is locked. Then in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the rotation angle of the prism is set based on the determined angle vector, and then the prism is enabled to rotate, so that the object to be close-up can be driven to move to the center of the screen picture. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the dashed face represents the position of the face before it is moved, and the solid-line face represents the position of the face after it is moved. It can be seen that the object to be close-up is moved to the center of the screen picture by means of the zoom control method according to the examples of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, the zoom control method according to the examples of the disclosure further includes: determining a distance ratio between a distance after at least one of the touch points is dragged and a distance before the at least one of the touch points is dragged; and controlling zoom scale based on the distance ratio.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, a user selects the object to be close-up by touching both sides of the object to be close-up. At this time, a distance between the two touch points is d1. Then, if the user wants to zoom up or zoom down, so the user drags at least one of the two touch points inwards or outwards, enabling the distance between the two touch points after dragging to be d2, and the distance ratio between the distance after at least one of the two touch points is dragged and the distance before the at least one of the two touch points is dragged is d2/d1. In such a way, the zoom scale can be easily controlled.
