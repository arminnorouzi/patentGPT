At low current densities of less than 1 A/cm<sup>2</sup>, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the conventional light-emitting structure will be very unstable, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency may drop sharply as the current changes only slightly. Therefore, the conventional light-emitting structure is inapplicable to electronic devices operated at low current.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regarding the development of a light-emitting structure for micro light-emitting diodes in electronic devices operated at low current, ON 107833953 discloses a growth method for producing a multi quantum well (MQW) structure of a micro light-emitting diode. The multi quantum well structure includes a blocking layer interposed between a well layer and a barrier layer. The well layer is made of indium gallium nitride (InGaN). The blocking layer and the barrier layer are made of gallium nitride (GaN), and hydrogen gas is introduced as a carrier gas during a deposition process of the barrier layer. However, quality and stress of lattices in the MQW structure of CN 107833953 are unsatisfying, and there is still a need in the art to provide an improved light-emitting structure applicable to the electronic devices operated at low current.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide a light-emitting structure, a method for producing the light-emitting structure, and a light-emitting device including the light-emitting structure, those can alleviate or overcome the aforesaid shortcomings of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a light-emitting structure includes an n-type layer, an active layer, and a p-type layer.

By virtue of the active layer that has a plurality of the light-emitting sections, the carrier overflow in the light-emitting sections can be suppressed effectively, the wavelength overlapping of the electrons and holes can be increased, and the stress in the light-emitting sections can be released effectively, thus the carrier transport and the recombination effect at low injection current can be improved, and a radiative recombination efficiency of the carrier and the photoelectric conversion efficiency can be enhanced.<br/>2. Since each of the light-emitting sections has the relatively thin well layer and the relatively thick barrier layers, and further has a greater ratio of the thickness of the well layer to the barrier layers, growth defect density in the multi quantum well can be reduced, growth quality of the multi quantum well can be noticeably improved, and non-radiative recombination efficiency can be reduced. Therefore, the peak value of the wall plug efficiency would noticeably increase.<br/>3. By virtue of the light-emitting sections that are grown by the different growth rates, the lattice mismatch stress between the well layer and the barrier layers of the active layer can be further improved, and the lattice quality of the active layer can be improved.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">It should be noted that, for a micro light-emitting device, a main active layer is referred to as an active layer that is closer to the p-type layer. Therefore, by growing the first light-emitting section <b>5</b> that is closer to the n-type layer <b>4</b> at a relatively high growth rate; and growing the second light-emitting section <b>7</b> that is closer to the p-type layer at a relatively low growth rate, the lattice mismatch stress between a part of the active layer that has the high indium content and the gallium nitride layer can be further reduced. Thus, the lattice quality of the active layer of the micro light-emitting device can be effectively improved, a relatively short growth time can be obtained to enhance the production efficiency.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0000">4. In each the quantum well structure periods, by adjusting the temperature and the growth rate to form the different well layers and different barrier layers, the lattice mismatch stress between the barrier layers and the well layer in each quantum well structure can be improved, thus the lattice quality of the multi quantum well can be improved.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments.
