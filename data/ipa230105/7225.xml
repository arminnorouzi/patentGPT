In this way, the rendered subpixels in the composite subpixels move close to each other to coincide at a same subpixel or will move close to each other to coincide at the same subpixel, i.e. the same subpixel in the composite subpixel is rendered or will be rendered.

In response to the decrease of a distance, the 3D processing apparatus triggers the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen to dynamically render red subpixels in a composite subpixel, such as at least two red subpixels, in a manner of moving relative to each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, in response to the decrease of a distance between the user and the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen, the 3D processing apparatus triggers the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen to dynamically adjust the rendering of red subpixels R<b>2</b> and R<b>4</b> associated with an initial viewpoint position of both eyes of the user to the rendering of red subpixels R<b>1</b> and R<b>5</b> associated with a subsequent viewpoint position of both eyes of the user.

In this way, the rendered subpixels in the composite subpixel move away from each other till they eventually exceed or will exceed outmost subpixels in the corresponding composite subpixel. For example, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, as a distance between the user and the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen continues to decrease, a red subpixel to be rendered next will continue to move away from each other relative to the red subpixels R<b>1</b> and R<b>5</b> until it will exceed the outermost subpixels R<b>1</b> and R<b>6</b> in the red composite subpixel. In other words, corresponding to a viewpoint position of both eyes of the user, when the user moves close to the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen to a certain distance, a subpixel corresponding to a current user viewpoint cannot be found in at least a part of the composite subpixel. In the case of dynamically rendering the subpixels in the composite subpixel in a manner of getting away relative to each other, the 3D processing apparatus triggers the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen to switch to 2D display when rendering is conducted to at least one subpixel beyond an outermost end of the composite subpixel. Similarly, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, dynamic rendering of subpixels that move away from each other till they exceed or will exceed the outermost subpixels of the corresponding composite subpixel may be determined by a change in the viewpoint due to a change of the distance.
