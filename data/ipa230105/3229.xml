Generally, the centrifugal fan has a base made of one single type of plastic material or a thin metal plate. In the case of using a plastic base, it is manufactured through a plastic injection molding process. However, since the plastic base has inferior structural strength, the thin metal plate is usually selected as the material for forming the fan frame base.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional centrifugal fan frame mainly includes two parts, namely, a base formed of a thin metal plate and a side wall formed of a plastic material. Generally, the plastic side wall is wrapped around an outer periphery of the metal base by way of integral injection molding. The plastic injection molded side wall is in a continuously extended configuration, so that the side wall and the base together constitute the centrifugal fan frame. This type of centrifugal fan frame has a problem, namely, the plastic material tends to produce a wrapping force in the process of injection molding. When the side wall is formed along the outer periphery of the metal base by injection molding, the metal base is compressed by the wrapping force from the plastic injection molded side wall and becomes deformed and uneven. In the subsequent assembling process, the deformed base would affect the designed clearance size, horizontality and balance between the fan blades and the base of the centrifugal fan. In a worse condition, the fan performance is also affected due to interference of the fan blades with the base, changes in the relationship between the static pressure (P) and air flow rate (Q) of the fan, changes in produced noise, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a structural design that can resist the deformation of the centrifugal fan frame during the injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an important target for persons skilled in the art to improve the drawback of the conventional centrifugal fan frame that the plastic injection molded side wall tends to cause deformation of the metal base.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A primary object of the present invention is to provide a centrifugal fan frame structure, which enables reduced wrapping force injection molded side wall sections of the fan frame structure and prevents a base plate of the fan frame structure from deformation under the wrapping force.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a centrifugal fan frame structure that includes a plurality of spaced side wall sections being formed by injection molding to connect to an outer periphery of a base plate, so that the fan frame structure is protected against deformation in the injection molding process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the above and other objects, the centrifugal fan frame structure according to the present invention includes a base plate and a plurality of side wall sections. The side wall sections are discontinuously formed along an outer periphery of the base plate through injection molding, such that a clearance is formed between any two adjacent side wall sections, and portions of the outer periphery of the base plate located corresponding to the clearances are not covered by any injection molded side wall sections. And, the side wall sections and the base plate together define a receiving space between them. With the fan frame structure designed according to the present invention, a wrapping force from the injection molded side wall sections is effectively reduced to prevent the base plate from deformation under the wrapping force, and the entire fan frame structure is also effectively protected against structural deformation in the process of injection molding.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the present invention, the side wall sections include a plurality of lengthwise extended side wall sections and a plurality of curved side wall sections. The lengthwise extended side wall sections and the curved side wall sections together form a surrounding wall. And, the curved side wall sections are spaced from and not connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present invention, the base plate and the side wall sections can be made of the same material or be made of different materials. In a preferred embodiment, the side wall sections are made of a plastic material while the base plate is made of a metal material.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, wherein</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective and partially sectioned view of a centrifugal fan frame structure according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of the centrifugal fan frame structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a centrifugal fan using the fan frame structure of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention will now be described with a preferred embodiment thereof and by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> along with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b> for a centrifugal fan <b>2</b> includes a base plate <b>11</b> and a plurality of side wall sections <b>12</b>. The base plate <b>11</b> is made of a metal material, such as stainless steel, aluminum, iron, titanium or any metal alloy. The base plate <b>11</b> includes a straight edge <b>111</b>, a pair of lengthwise extended edges <b>110</b>, a shaft barrel <b>114</b>, an air inlet <b>113</b> and a curved edge <b>112</b>. The curved edge <b>112</b> is extended from an end of one lengthwise extended edge <b>110</b> along an outer peripheral profile of the base plate <b>11</b> to an end of the other lengthwise extended edge <b>110</b>. The straight edge <b>111</b> is connected at two ends to another ends of the lengthwise extended edges <b>110</b> at a right angle. The shaft barrel <b>114</b> is located at a central area of the base plate <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the shaft barrel <b>114</b> can be eccentrically located on the base plate <b>11</b>. The centrifugal fan <b>2</b> has a fan wheel <b>22</b> including a plurality of blades <b>23</b>, and the fan wheel <b>22</b> is rotatably mounted on the shaft barrel <b>114</b>. The air inlet <b>113</b> is provided on the base plate <b>11</b> around an outer side of the shaft barrel <b>114</b> for guiding external air flow into the centrifugal fan <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The side wall sections <b>12</b> can be made of a plastic material or a metal material, and consist of a plurality of lengthwise extended side wall sections <b>121</b> and a plurality of curved side wall sections <b>122</b>. The lengthwise extended side wall sections <b>121</b> and the curved side wall sections <b>122</b> together define a surrounding wall of the centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b>. In the preferred embodiment, it is selected to form the lengthwise extended side wall sections <b>121</b> and the curved side wall sections <b>122</b> with a plastic material through an integral injection molding process, such that the lengthwise extended side wall sections <b>121</b> and the curved side wall sections <b>122</b> are associated with the lengthwise extended edge <b>110</b> and the curved edge <b>112</b> of the base plate <b>11</b>, respectively. More specifically, the side wall sections <b>12</b> include several discontinuously arranged sections formed through insert molding (i.e. integral plastic injection molding) to be associated with the lengthwise extended edge <b>110</b> and the curved edge <b>110</b> of the base plate <b>11</b> to complete the centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b>. Further, any two adjacent curved side wall sections <b>122</b> are spaced from one another by a clearance <b>13</b>. It is noted portions of the curved edge <b>112</b> located corresponding to the clearances <b>13</b> are not covered by the insert molded curved side wall sections <b>122</b>, and any two adjacent curved side wall sections <b>122</b> are not connected to each other. The clearances <b>13</b> among the side wall sections <b>12</b> provide the injection molded side wall sections <b>12</b> with sufficient expansion allowance. With this arrangement, it is able to prevent the side wall sections <b>12</b> from compressing the base plate <b>11</b> when the plastic molding material of the side wall sections <b>12</b> expands after the injection molding; and a wrapping force produced by the insert molding plastic material can be effectively reduced to minimize deformation of the base plate <b>11</b> caused by the wrapping force.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The side wall sections <b>12</b> and the base plate <b>11</b> together define a receiving space <b>14</b> and an air outlet <b>15</b>. The receiving space <b>14</b> is communicable with the air inlet <b>113</b> and the air outlet <b>15</b>. The shaft barrel <b>114</b> and the fan wheel <b>22</b> mounted thereon are located in the receiving space <b>14</b>. Further, the base plate <b>11</b> and the side wall sections <b>12</b> can be made of the same material or be made of different materials.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In practical implementation of the present invention, the side wall sections <b>12</b> of the centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b> are connected at respective upper side to a top plate <b>21</b> of the centrifugal fan <b>2</b>. Therefore, when the centrifugal fan <b>2</b> uses the centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b> of the present invention, the fan wheel <b>22</b> of the centrifugal fan <b>2</b> and the blades <b>23</b> provided on the fan wheel <b>22</b> can maintain at a fixed axial distance away from the base plate <b>11</b> to effectively ensure stable performance of the centrifugal fan <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, since the side wall sections <b>12</b> formed through the injection molding process are actually separated into several spaced sections, which are connected to an outer periphery of the base plate <b>11</b> to complete the centrifugal fan frame structure <b>1</b>, the wrapping force applied by the injection molded side wall sections <b>12</b> to the base plate <b>11</b> can be effectively reduced to prevent the base plate <b>11</b> against structural deformation and accordingly, to effectively prevent the entire fan frame structure <b>1</b> from deformation in the process of injection molding.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention has been described with a preferred embodiment thereof and it is understood that many changes and modifications in the described embodiment can be carried out without departing from the scope and the spirit of the invention that is intended to be limited only by the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
