For the sake of clarity of the present disclosure, the dimensions of structures may be depicted as being larger than the actual sizes thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">It should be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;have&#x201d;, etc., when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof. Also, it should be understood that, when an element such as a layer, film, area, or sheet is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it may be directly on the other element, or intervening elements may be present therebetween. Similarly, when an element, such as a layer, film, area, or sheet is referred to as being &#x201c;under&#x201d; another element, it may be directly under the other element, or intervening elements may be present therebetween.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Unless otherwise specified, all numbers, values, and/or representations that express the amounts of components, reaction conditions, polymer compositions, and mixtures used herein are to be taken as approximations including various uncertainties affecting measurement that inherently occur in obtaining these values, among others, and thus should be understood to be modified by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in all cases.

The body panel includes a perforated pattern portion including, as a perforated pattern, a plurality of patterned perforations formed by press-perforating a metal sheet under specific conditions and includes a transparent portion including a plate layer located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion and a plurality of convex layers formed in the plurality of patterned perforations. The vehicle panel also includes a lighting unit located so as to emit light from the inner surface of the panel body. The lighting unit includes a light guide plate including, as a three-dimensional pattern, a plurality of patterned intaglios engraved in the rear surface thereof. The vehicle panel may realize characters or patterns through the press-perforating process. Thus, a pattern may be realized through minimal means and a simple method, thus reducing the amount of time taken and the expense incurred for the production of a product. Moreover, large-area patterning is possible, so the process of the present disclosure is applicable to large parts. Additionally, a uniform lighting pattern may be realized, and emotional quality (e.g., aesthetic appearance and user satisfaction) may be improved when power is turned on/off, thereby completing a vehicle panel according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a vehicle panel according to an embodiment.

The lighting unit <b>20</b> also includes a light source <b>250</b> provided at a lateral side of the light guide plate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The panel body <b>10</b> is not particularly limited, so long as only a perforated pattern is viewed when power is turned off and a logical pattern with various designs is viewed when power is turned on, to thereby increase the emotional quality (e.g., aesthetic appearance and user experience) of metal parts (i.e., the vehicle panel).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">The perforated pattern portion <b>100</b> of the panel body <b>10</b> may be located at the outermost position of the panel body and may include a plurality of patterned perforations <b>105</b> in the form of through-holes.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The shape of the patterned perforations <b>105</b> may vary depending on the shape of the perforation pins used for a press-perforating process. For example, a desired shape such as a circle, a triangle, a square, a rhombus, etc. may be obtained through the shape of the perforation pins, and it is not limited to only a specific shape.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The perforated pattern portion <b>100</b> may use a metal sheet in order to improve the emotional quality of metal parts. The metal sheet may be selected from the group consisting of, for example, an aluminum sheet, a copper sheet, a stainless steel (SUS) sheet, and other alloys, and is not limited to a specific metal sheet.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The thickness of the metal sheet should be a thickness that allows the press-perforating process without the metal sheet being torn by the press-perforating process, and in one example may be 0.2 mm to 0.8 mm. Out of the above range, if the thickness of the metal sheet is too low, the metal sheet may be torn during the press-perforating process, whereas if the thickness of the metal sheet is too high, the press-perforating process is impossible, which is undesirable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The size of the shape of the patterned perforations, i.e., the diameter of the patterned perforations, may be measured based on the length of the largest radius on a basis of the center point of the shape of the patterned perforations. In one example, the diameter of the patterned perforations may be greater than 0.5 mm and less than 1.0 mm. Out of the above range, if the diameter of the patterned perforations is too small, the convex layers cannot be properly formed because the patterned perforations are not completely filled with the material for the transparent portion during insert injection with the transparent portion, so luminance may be lowered when the perforated pattern is viewed. On the other hand, if the diameter of the patterned perforations is too large, overflow of the material for the transparent portion beyond the outermost surface of the patterned perforations may occur during insert injection with the transparent portion.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">The transparent portion <b>150</b> of the panel body <b>10</b> may be located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion or inside the patterned perforations and may emit light radiated from the light source through the portion located inside the patterned perforations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Specifically, the transparent portion <b>150</b> may include a plate layer <b>151</b> located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion and a plurality of convex layers <b>155</b> formed inside the plurality of patterned perforations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The light radiated from the light source cannot pass through the perforated pattern portion that is blocked with a metal sheet not having patterned perforations therein, corresponding to the plate layer. However, the light may pass through the plurality of convex layers formed inside the plurality of patterned perforations, and may thus be emitted.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Accordingly, the transparent portion may include a transparent material that is light-transmissive and is capable of transmitting light. For example, the transparent material may be at least one transparent resin selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate (PC), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polycarbonate/polyethylene terephthalate glycol composite (PC/PETG), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), and PC/ABS composite, but is not limited to including only a specific resin.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Also, the transparent portion may improve the three-dimensional effect of the perforated pattern in which light is transmitted and emitted through the addition of an additional pigment or a diffusing agent. The additional pigment may be, for example, carbon black, silica, titanium dioxide, an azo-based compound, a phthalocyanine-based compound, or the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Accordingly, the perforated pattern portion according to an embodiment includes patterned perforations having a diameter in a specific range for a metal sheet that satisfies the thickness conditions, etc. The transparent portion includes the plurality of convex layers formed inside the plurality of patterned perforations. Therefore, when power is turned off, the perforated pattern portion is visible as the perforated pattern, and when power is turned on, a logical pattern with various designs is viewed, thus effectively improving the emotional quality of metal parts.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">The lighting unit <b>20</b> may be located so as to emit light from the inner surface of the panel body. The lighting device <b>2</b>&#x2014;may include a light guide plate <b>200</b> provided at a corresponding position on the panel body <b>10</b> and including a plurality of patterned intaglios <b>205</b> engraved in the rear surface thereof. The lighting device <b>20</b> may also include a light source <b>250</b> provided at a lateral side of the light guide plate and may further include a process control block (PCB) <b>210</b> directly connected to the light source to control the light source.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">The light guide plate <b>200</b> is provided at a corresponding position on the panel body to receive light incident from the applied light source, change the direction of the light in a direction corresponding to the panel body, and radiate the light onto the panel body.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">Specifically, the light may be effectively radiated onto the panel body from the light source through the plurality of patterned intaglios <b>205</b> engraved in the rear surface of the light guide plate.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">To this end, the patterned intaglios may be provided at respective positions corresponding to the patterned perforations and may be obliquely recessed upwards at a predetermined inclination angle from the rear surface of the light guide plate. When the patterned intaglios are provided at positions corresponding to the patterned perforations, there is an advantage in that the luminance of the light emitted through the patterned perforations is consistent, so a uniform lighting pattern without variation in luminance may be realized.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The diameter of the patterned intaglios may be larger than the diameter of the patterned perforations. If the diameter of the patterned intaglios is smaller than the diameter of the patterned perforations, the light from the light source cannot be effectively radiated in the direction corresponding to the panel body. Specifically, the diameter of the patterned intaglios may be larger than the diameter of the patterned perforations by an amount within a range greater than 0.05 mm and less than 0.3 mm. Accordingly, the diameter of the patterned intaglios may be greater than 0.55 mm and less than 1.3 mm. Out of the above range, if the diameter of the patterned intaglios is too small or too large, the luminance may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Also, the depth of the patterned intaglios may be determined depending on the obliquely recessed angle of inclination, and it may be possible to adjust the inclination angle so as to form a depth that enables the light from the light source to be radiated by effectively reflecting the light in the corresponding direction of the panel body. Specifically, the inclination angle that determines the depth of the patterned intaglios may be 30&#xb0; to 70&#xb0;. Out of the above range, if the inclination angle is too low, the light may be transmitted, whereas if the inclination angle is too high, the light may be reflected back. Out of the above range, there is a disadvantage in that the luminance of the light emitted from the perforated metal portion decreases.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">The vehicle panel according to an embodiment is configured such that the lighting unit includes the light guide plate including the plurality of patterned intaglios having specific conditions in the rear surface thereof. Thus, there is an advantage in that a uniform lighting pattern without variation in luminance may be realized.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The light source <b>250</b> included in the lighting unit is not particularly limited, so long as it is provided at the lateral side of the light guide plate and is able to emit light. The light source according to the present disclosure may be exemplified by an LED capable of emitting light in various colors (red/blue/white, etc.), and may be configured to be turned on at the same time as a car headlight or taillight, which is mainly turned on at night. When the driver operates a multi-function switch to turn on the headlights or the taillights, the circuit may be configured so that the light source is turned on by receiving vehicle power at the same time.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The process control block (PCB) <b>210</b> may be directly connected to the light source to control the light source. For example, when the lighting logic is coded and stored in the PCB, the corresponding logic is executed in response to the switch signal operated by the driver, and the lighting is implemented according to a previously stored manner.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">For the vehicle panel according to an embodiment, the light of the light source is incident on the light guide plate and reflected through the three-dimensional pattern, the reflected light is radiated onto the panel body, and the radiated light passes through the convex layers of the transparent portion. Thus, the lighting pattern may be viewed in accordance with the shape of the patterned perforations.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Here, the vehicle panel according to an embodiment includes the perforated pattern portion having a perforated pattern and the light guide plate having a three-dimensional intaglio pattern manufactured under specific conditions. Thus, a uniform lighting pattern without variation in luminance may be realized. When the power is turned off, only the perforated pattern is viewed, and when the power is turned on, a logical pattern with various designs is viewed, thus improving the emotional quality of metal parts.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">In addition, a method of manufacturing the vehicle panel according to another embodiment includes manufacturing a perforated pattern portion by press-perforating a metal sheet to form a plurality of patterned perforations in the form of through-holes. The method also includes attaching a protective tape to the upper surface of the perforated pattern portion and subjecting the perforated pattern portion having the protective tape attached thereto to sheet pressing. The method further includes manufacturing a panel body by performing insert injection on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion to integrate a transparent portion including a plate layer located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion and a plurality of convex layers provided in the plurality of patterned perforations with the perforated pattern portion. The method also includes removing the protective tape and locating a lighting unit so as to correspond to the panel body. Here, the method of manufacturing the vehicle panel according to another embodiment may include contents that substantially overlap those related to the vehicle panel according to an embodiment. A description of overlapping contents has been omitted.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The manufacturing the perforated pattern portion is a step of manufacturing a perforated pattern portion by press-perforating a metal sheet to form a plurality of patterned perforations in the form of through-holes. Here, the press-perforating process may be performed using a plurality of perforation pins to form a plurality of patterned perforations in the metal sheet. The perforation pins may be manufactured to have the same shape and diameter as those of the intended patterned perforations. The diameter of the perforation pins may be greater than 0.5 mm and less than 1.0 mm. Out of the above range, if the diameter of the perforation pins is too small, the perforation pins may break during the press-perforating process and the press-perforating process cannot be performed, whereas if the diameter of the perforation pins is too large, the metal sheet may tear during the press-perforating process.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">The method of manufacturing the vehicle panel according to another embodiment is advantageous in that a character or pattern may be implemented through the press-perforating process. Thus, a pattern may be realized through minimal means and a simple method.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Then, before attaching the protective tape, the method may further include cutting the perforated metal sheet to a desired predetermined size.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">The attaching the protective tape to the upper surface of the perforated pattern portion is a step of attaching the protective tape to the upper surface of the perforated pattern portion, which is the press-perforated metal sheet, in order to prevent overflow of the resin during subsequent insert injection.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">The protective tape is not particularly limited, so long as it is able to prevent overflow of the transparent resin. The protective tape may be configured, for example, such that an adhesive of a component that adheres to the surface of aluminum is attached to the back of a metal thin film having a glass transition temperature of 100&#xb0; C. or higher or a film made of a polymer material.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">Here, in order to prevent overflow of the resin during insert injection, the protective tape has to possess physical properties such as tensile strength, adhesive strength, and elongation sufficient to withstand the flow pressure of the resin.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Specifically, the tensile strength of the protective tape may be 30 N/cm or more, and in one example may be 40 N/cm to 70 N/cm. Out of the above range, if the tensile strength of the protective tape is too low, tearing may occur during press injection despite the protective tape being attached to the perforated pattern portion. On the other hand, if the tensile strength of the protective tape is too high, the tape may peel off in highly stretched sections.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Also, the adhesive strength of the protective tape may be 3 N/cm or more, and in one example may be 4 N/cm to 10 N/cm. Out of the above range, if the adhesive strength of the protective tape is too low, the protective tape may peel off during subsequent pressing. On the other hand, if the adhesive strength of the protective tape is too high, the protective tape may not be detached easily after pressing, thereby lowering work efficiency.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">Also, the elongation of the protective tape may be 30% to 200% for the purpose of subsequent sheet pressing. Out of the above range, if the elongation of the protective tape is too low, the tape may break during subsequent pressing, whereas if the elongation of the protective tape is too high, it is difficult to remove the protective tape after pressing.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">After attaching the protective tape, the sheet pressing step may be performed before insert injection. Sheet pressing is a step of not only cutting out unnecessary edges, but also forming the desired product shape.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In the manufacturing the panel body, the prepared transparent resin is insert-injected on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion. Thus, a transparent portion, including a plate layer located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion and a plurality of convex layers provided inside the plurality of patterned perforations, is integrated with the perforated pattern portion, thus manufacturing the panel body.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">As used herein, the term &#x201c;insert injection&#x201d; refers to an injection-molding process in which a metal sheet including patterned perforations, which is a part not made of plastic, is located at a desired position in a mold for injection and then a resin such as plastic is injected into the mold to realize integration.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Through the insert injection, not only the plate layer located on the lower surface of the perforated pattern portion but also the plurality of convex layers formed by injecting the resin into the plurality of patterned perforations of the metal sheet may be formed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Here, the protective tape is capable of withstanding the flow pressure of the resin due to insert injection. The convex layers may be appropriately formed through the diameter of patterned perforations and the physical properties of the protective tape, so the luminance of the lighting pattern is excellent.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">After properly forming the convex layers, the protective tape may be removed from the upper surface of the perforated pattern portion.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a lighting unit may be located so as to correspond to the panel body.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the panel body and the light guide plate of the vehicle panel according to an embodiment.
