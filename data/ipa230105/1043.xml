id="p-0002" num="0001">Surgical adhesives designed to interface with tissues, especially for internal use, must be biocompatible, easy to apply, and able to adhere to biological tissues under wet, dry, clean and/or biofouled conditions. These requirements, however, greatly limit the application of surgical adhesives in biomedical applications, with current commercially available surgical adhesives presenting one or more of undesirable strength, toxicity, difficult workflow, and/or requiring clean, dry surfaces for optimal performance.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Severe traumatic craniomaxillofacial (CMF) fracture commonly occurs due to high energy trauma such as motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, war injuries, and physical assault. Many of these fractures require surgical stabilization and/or reconstructed. Current adhesives that may be used to stabilize CMF and other fractures suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: high water solubility, weak bond strength, a curing time that is either too slow or too fast, irreversible rigid curing that does not allow proper reduction, and a lack of biocompatibility. Therefore, there exists a need for new bioadhesives.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention features adhesive devices for holding objects (e.g., bone fragments) fixed in position with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, the invention features a method for stabilizing bone fragments in a body, the method including the steps of:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">(i) forming a first anchor on a first bone fragment by (a) heating an adhesive composition to form a softened adhesive composition and contacting the softened adhesive composition to the first bone fragment, and (b) permitting the softened adhesive composition to cool to form the first anchor affixed to the first bone fragment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(ii) forming a second anchor on a second bone fragment by (a) heating an adhesive composition to form a softened adhesive composition and contacting the softened adhesive composition to the second bone fragment, and (b) permitting the softened adhesive composition to cool to form the second anchor affixed to the second bone fragment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">wherein the adhesive composition has a tackifying temperature of at least 40&#xb0; C. (e.g., at least 42&#xb0; C., at least 45&#xb0; C., at least 50&#xb0; C., at least 55&#xb0; C., or between from 40&#xb0; C. to 55&#xb0; C.), and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">wherein the first anchor and the second anchor are connected to a support structure for stabilizing the bone fragments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the support structure is a flexible support including a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer linking the first anchor to the second anchor. In some embodiments, the support structure, the first anchor, and the second anchor are formed from a tape including (x) a non-adhesive top layer that is the support structure, and (y) a bottom layer that is adhesive when softened to form the first anchor and the second anchor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the adhesive composition is not water soluble (e.g., has a water solubility at 25&#xb0; C. of less than 30 mg/L, 25 mg/L, 20 mg/L, or 15 mg/L). In other embodiments, the adhesive composition is water soluble (e.g., has a solubility in water at 25&#xb0; C. of greater than 30 mg/L or 50 mg/L).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the adhesive composition includes an inorganic particulate additive heat transfer agent.

In some embodiments, the heat transfer agent is present in an amount that permits the adhesive composition to soften within 120 seconds or less of applying energy (e.g., within 10 seconds or less). In particular embodiments, the heat transfer agent is present in an amount that permits the adhesive composition to soften within 10 seconds or less of applying energy to the non-adhesive top layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive composition includes about 0.5-60% (w/w) heat transfer agent (e.g., 7.5&#xb1;2.5%, 10&#xb1;5%, 15&#xb1;5%, 20&#xb1;5%, 25&#xb1;10%, 37.5&#xb1;5%, 50&#xb1;10%, or 35-60% (w/w)).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the second aspect, the adhesive layer includes a particulate filler.

For example, an adhesion section (or adhesion side) of the disclosure can be softened after exposure to energy (e.g., within 120 seconds or less (e.g., within 10 seconds or less)); the adhesion section (or adhesion side) may then rigidify (i.e., stiffen) within 120 seconds or less (e.g., within 10 seconds or less). The rigidification of the adhesion section (or adhesion side) which fixes two (or more) bone fragments with respect to each other allows bone fractures to heal.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0122">As used herein, the term &#x201c;soften&#x201d; refers to a decrease in the stiffness of the material or substance. For example, a device or an adhesion side of the disclosure can soften after exposure to energy; within 120 seconds or less (e.g., 10 seconds or less), the softened adhesion side can flow, conforming to the geometry of a biological tissue or other substrate.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0123">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tackifying temperature&#x201d; refers to a temperature at which an adhesive blend or compound goes from non-flowable to string forming when contacted with a glass pipette tip.

The disclosed device is useful for attaching to bone or to secure a material to a tissue in order to provide stability or support. The disclosed device may eliminate or reduce the need to use staples, sutures, tacks, screws, or the like to secure or repair damaged tissues (or bone), or to secure implants within the body.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0140">Devices A device of the disclosure can be used to hold two or more objects (e.g., bone fragments, ligaments, tendons) fixed with respect to each other. The device of the disclosure can be made of a gradient of a mixture of one or more adhesives (e.g., polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) described herein) and one or more fillers (e.g., non-adhesive polymers).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0141">Gradient of Adhesive(s), Filler(s), and Heat Transfer Agent(s)</p><p id="p-0177" num="0142">The device of the disclosure may have varying compositions in different sections of the device. For example, the device can include at least two sections: (i) at least one adhesion section (e.g., a section of the device composed of: 30-100% (w/w) of one or more adhesives (e.g., polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) as described herein), 0-70% (w/w) of one or more fillers (e.g., non-adhesive polymer(s)), and 0.5-60% (w/w) of one or more of heat transfer agent(s))) which adheres to at least one of the objects (e.g. tissues, such as, e.g., bone fragments, ligaments, tendons, etc.); and (ii) at least one support structure (e.g., a section of the device composed of: 40-100% (w/w) of one or more fillers (e.g., a non-adhesive polymer), and 0-60% (w/w) zero or more adhesives and zero or more heat transfer agents). The support structure may be formed from an anchoring material such as, e.g., polycaprolactone. The adhesion section (e.g., a section of the device composed of a sufficiently high amount of adhesive(s)) may be non-tacky at room temperature, and may be softened upon exposure to energy, such as, e.g., ultrasonic energy, infrared radiation, or radiofrequency (RF)). The softened adhesion section can conform to the shape of the object (e.g., a bone fragment) it contacts. Once the energy exposure is ceased, the adhesion section will cool and rigidify, thus binding the object (e.g., a bone fragment) it contacts. The process may be repeated for the second object (and for the third, fourth, fifth object, or however many objects there are to secure to the preceding objects). This reversible softening feature of the adhesion section is advantageous so as to facilitate ease of handing, placement, workflow and control of device application.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0143">The adhesion section and support structure may be arranged to make sides of the device: an adhesion side (where the adhesion section is a coating of one or more adhesives admixed with one or more fillers) can contact and adhere two or more objects (e.g., bone fragments), and a support side that backs the adhesion side. In this case, energy (e.g., ultrasonic energy, infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF)) may be delivered to the support side of the device through which heat can transfer to the adhesion side (which contacts the object(s)) without significant deformation of the support structure. This selective softening of the adhesive component relative to the support component is advantageous so as to retain the strength and/or performance of the support structure.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0144">The adhesion section (or adhesion side) may be composed of an admixture of adhesives (e.g, polymer(s) having the structure of formula (I) as described herein) and fillers that may be varied to alter properties of the device of the disclosure such as, e.g., adhesion strength, tackifying temperature, cytotoxicity, tensile strength, time of rigidification, surface fouling resistant properties, brittleness, and viscosity.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0145">The support structure (or support side) may be composed of an admixture of fillers and adhesives that may be varied to alter properties of the support, such as, e.g., porosity (e.g., having pores or texture in which an adhesive may fill), brittleness (e.g., the support structure (or support side) preferably can bend or twist 90&#xb0; without flaking), flexibility, surface fouling properties, and tensile strength. Additionally, the supporting structure (or support side) may contain a perceptible pattern or texture to aid in determination of direction and orientation for application. This pattern may contain a pattern which provides both a visual and/or tactile perception for determining orientation.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0146">A device (and its components, e.g., the adhesive polymers and non-adhesive polymers that make up the adhesion section (and adhesion side) and support structure (and support side)) of the disclosure may be optionally biodegradable and optionally biocompatible.

An adhesive or admixture of adhesives of the disclosure can have water solubilities less than 30 mg per L of water.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0165">Generally, adhesives for use in biomedical devices as found in the prior art all teach of the assembly of irreversible crosslinked networks by virtue of large polymeric assemblies either use or are formed chemically from the monomers (e.g. US20140311673A1, WO2017044896A1, WO2014158288A1, US20120029559A1, US20160346424A1, WO2016134304A1, PCT/CA2020051781). They either teach that low molecular weight molecules with low viscosity must be used for flowing before cure or, when large solid polymeric materials are used, solvents or other diluents are necessary to make them flowable. The use of solvents in biomedical adhesives, however, introduces unnecessary toxicity and/or impedes the curing and bonding of the adhesive. Further, flowable systems are susceptible to runoff or leaching of reactive adhesive components and/or oxidants away from the site of application, and/or retention of unreacted species, all of which can present as inflammatory responses in vivo.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0166">Compared to the prior art, the adhesives of formula I are not dependent upon in situ curing reactions for adhesion, and are not susceptible to adhesive leaching/runoff from the application site which can result in undesired side reactions and inflammatory complications. Further, the nature of Block B also means that these adhesives are not particularly prone to swelling and, therefore, inflammatory complications due to the swelling of the device in vivo. The reversible softening properties of the adhesives at temperatures close to physiological temperatures also introduces the benefits of not requiring solvent for surface wetting, of being non-tacky at room temperature, thereby facilitating facile workflow, and of not requiring high temperatures for adhesive softening so as to mitigate the risk of tissue necrosis.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Filler</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0167">A device of the disclosure can contain a varying amount (or gradient) of one or more fillers. A filler can be non-adhesive materials or substances that may be added to alter properties of the device of the disclosure such as, e.g., adhesion strength, tackifying temperature, cytotoxicity, tensile strength, time of rigidification, and viscosity. For example, a filler can be, e.g., polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDX), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB), poly lactic acid (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB), polyethylene carbonate (PEC), polypropylene carbonate (PPC), poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), polysulfone, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxyapatite (HA), tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), dicalcium phosphate (DCP), or a copolymer thereof.

The heat transfer agent may be a salt, such as, e.g., sodium chloride, iron(III) phosphate dihydrate, iron(III) citrate monohydrate, hydroxyapatite, tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP), tricalcium phosphate (TCP), dicalcium phosphate (DCP), or sodium carbonate.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Softening and Rigidification of the Device</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0170">An adhesion section (or adhesion side) can reversibly soften (e.g., decrease in stiffness) or rigidify (e.g., increase in stiffness) when exposed to energy (e.g., ultrasonic energy, infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF)) or when cooled (e.g., cooling at ambient temperature without exposure to the energy described herein), respectively. The adhesion section (or adhesion side) is softened if the adhesive or admixture of adhesives has undergone a phase transition from solid to softened state (rigid to malleable state), and can form strings of softened polymer when contacted with a glass pipette tip. Once softened, the adhesion section (or adhesion side) can be contacted with one or more of the objects to be affixed. The softened adhesion section (or adhesion side) can subsequently rigidify within 120 seconds (or less) (e.g, less than 10 seconds) once the adhesion section (or adhesion side) is no longer exposed to energy (e.g., ultrasonic energy, infrared radiation, RF). Preferably, the disclosed adhesion section (or adhesion side) has a tackifying temperature of 40&#xb0; C. or greater.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Dimensions of the Device</heading><p id="p-0212" num="0171">The device of the disclosure may have a thickness between 0.02-1.5 mm (e.g., 0.3&#xb1;0.2 mm). Depending on the application and mass of the tissue/bone to be stabilized, this thickness will vary accordingly. For example, a thinner device may be used for soft tissue applications (e.g., 0.05 mm thick) whereas a thicker device may be used for bone stabilization (e.g., 1.0 mm thick). Accordingly, the time required to soften the adhesion section (or adhesion side) will be proportional to the thickness of the device. Furthermore, the time required to rigidify will also be proportional to the thickness of the device.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0172">The device of the disclosure may be prepared as a sheet (having all the components of a device described herein (e.g., an adhesion section, a support structure)) up to 100 mm long and 100 mm wide (e.g., 60 mm&#xd7;60 mm).

The contacted adhesion section may then be softened using an energy source such as, e.g., ultrasonic energy, infrared radiation, radiofrequency (RF). After cooling, the adhesion section will solidify and bind to the bone fragment. The process may then be repeated for each adhesion section and bone fragment contact area. The bound device can thus stabilize the fracture, and maintain physiological alignment necessary for bone union. The process may also be done in situ or ex situ (e.g., a fragment may be removed from the body, contacted, and bonded with an adhesion section (or adhesion side) of the device, then put back in place and further secured),</p><p id="p-0218" num="0177">The device of the disclosure may hold two or more (e.g., 2 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30, 31 to 35, 36 to 40, 41 to 45, 46 to 50 or more) bone fragments fixed with respect to each other.

Support Side Preparation</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0196">Filaments of polymer blends were created using a micro-compounding procedure. Briefly, polymers were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight prior to use. For films composed of blends of polymers, the polymers were first compounded into filaments using a 10 mL Xplore Twin Screw Micro-compounder at a temperature suitable to melt the polymer (115-220&#xb0; C. based on the polymers being compounded) for approximately 5 min at 200 rpm. Polymers were extruded into filaments and pelleted.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0197">Pellets were dried under vacuum and then compression molded into thin films on a Carver Automated heated press at 1000-2000 kg. Briefly, platens were heated to a suitable melting temperature. Filaments are cut into &#x2dc;3 cm lengths to a specific mass, depending on the size of sheet to be pressed. Teflon liners and molds were used to prevent the polymer melt from sticking to the steel platens. In select cases, teflon liners were textured in order to impart a texture in the resulting sheet (see Example 4). Teflon molds range in thickness from 0.1-0.5 mm. Molding was done by layering steel sheet, Teflon liner, Teflon mold and polymer material, Teflon liner, and steel sheet. The lamellar molding sandwich was placed on the bottom platen and raised to &#x2dc;1 mm below the top platen. The polymer was melted without any applied force for 10 minutes. After melting, force was increased to &#x2dc;100-300 kg manually. Once the force dropped to &#x2dc;0-100 kg, hydraulic pressure was released to allow any air bubbles to dissipate. Force was then increased in auto mode at 15% speed to 1000-2000 kg (depending on desired thickness) for 5 minutes. The lamellar mold set up was transferred to a 37&#xb0; C. and allowed to cool naturally before removing the sheet from the mold. The sheet was trimmed to remove excess material and stored in a desiccator prior to use.

Texturing Polymer Sheets</heading><p id="p-0249" num="0198">In order to create a texture on the adhesion side of the polymer sheets, subtractive, laser etching was used to texture a Teflon liner, as to impart a positive feature in the polymer sheet during compression molding. Textures were created using computer aided design in Autocad. Textures were laser etched into Teflon sheets on a 60 W CO<sub>2 </sub>laser engraver (Universal Laser Systems, VLS3.5). After etching, textured Teflon sheets were cleaned with isopropanol and compressed air to remove excess material. One polymer sheet was pressed onto the newly etched Teflon liner and removed in order to further clean the textured liner prior to use. Feature dimensions were tuned using more passes or higher power as necessary, but generally measured 100-200 &#x3bc;m in depth. Textured sheets were then used as liners during compression molding of polymer sheets to induce positive features approximately 100-150 &#x3bc;m in height.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Example 5. Device Assembly</heading><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Method 1: Pressed</heading><p id="p-0250" num="0199">Cryomilled/compounded adhesive, adhesive blends or adhesive admixtures were hot-pressed onto polymer sheets/films. Briefly, polymer sheets/films (prepared as reported in Example 4) were plasma treated under a partial oxygen atmosphere for at least 2 minutes using a benchtop plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, USA). Meanwhile the hot press (Carver, USA) was heated to 75&#xb0; C. (upper platen) and 70&#xb0; C. (lower platen). Approximately 0.8 g of adhesive, adhesive blends or adhesive admixtures was placed on to the center of the polymer sheet. The sheet was then placed into a similar laminar mold set up as used for compression molding of the sheet with the adhesion side facing up. The mold thickness was set in order to set the adhesive thickness. The mold was placed on the platen and raised such that the upper platen was &#x3c;1 mm from the mold. The material was allowed to melt for 5-10 min under no pressure. After the melt step, 800 kg of force was automatically applied at 15% speed and held for an additional 5 min. The mold was removed and allowed to cool to room temperature before removing the resulting polymer sheet/adhesive composite.</p><heading id="h-0034" level="2">Method 2: Laminated</heading><p id="p-0251" num="0200">The laminated method comprised lamination of pre-pressed sheets of the support polymer and the adhesive layers onto each other. Adhesive sheets were prepared using a modified version of the compression molding method used for the support side polymers (Example 4). In brief, compounded rods of the adhesive blends were cut lengthwise into 5 mm pieces and approximately 0.8-1.0 g were placed into the compression molding set up. This mold was then placed into the hot press, which was maintained at 105&#xb0; C. for both platens, so that the compression mold was &#x3c;1 mm from the top platen to maximize heating. The adhesive was allowed to melt for 5 min and then 1000-4000 kg (depending on desired thickness) of force was applied for 2 min. The mold was then removed from the hot press and cooled to room temperature and the adhesive layer was removed for lamination. Separately, polymer sheets/films (prepared as reported in Example 4) were plasma treated under a partial oxygen atmosphere for at least 2 minutes using a benchtop plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, USA). For lamination, the backing layer was placed on top of the adhesive layer between two sheets of Teflon, and then placed into a laminator set to approximately 150-250 F (depending on the adhesive thickness). The resulting sheet was allowed to cool to room temperature before the laminated tape was removed from the Teflon sheets.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table

The tackifying temperature was taken at the temperature at which the adhesive mixture changed from a non-flowing solid to a viscous amorphous state that just stringed when prodded with a pipette. Adhesive properties were determined on adhesive films obtained using an Auto C-PL, H laboratory press (Carver Inc, USA). Approximately 0.1 g of adhesive was placed between Teflon liners and left on the press for 5 min to thermally equilibrate to the 80&#xb0; C. set temperature.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, this occurs if the polymer filler positively impacts the physical and/or mechanical properties of the adhesive, thereby functioning as a second phase strengthener. For example, polymer fillers with too low (e.g. PLC7015) or too high (e.g. LG824s, L210s HA) softening temperatures restrict the performance of the adhesive layer to below that of the control adhesive (no fillers) itself. Higher molecular weight polymers present improved tensile resistance (e.g. PCL50 versus PCL14, PBA), whilst flexible polymers (e.g. PBA) contribute to improved peel performance. Inorganic fillers, e.g. HA, do not provide the same level of second phase strengthening as the compatible polymer fillers do. Without wishing to be bound by theory, inorganic particulates are typically void fillers, whereas polymer fillers contribute to improved elongation/tensile properties on account of their long chain entanglement interactions.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0214">Polymers which are not miscible with the adhesive compounds (evidenced from distinct adhesive and polymer Tg domains on DSC thermograms), e.g. LG824s and L210s HA, also do not work well, likely because their phase strengthening mechanism is reduced to primarily void filling in the absence of the chain entanglement and the associated intermolecular interactions which are facilitated by phase mixing of the polymer phase with the adhesive compounds. This is corroborated by Device C-7 (Table 6) which shows that the highest scores are obtained when another adhesive compound with suitable mechanical and/or physical properties is incorporated into the adhesive layer as the polymer filler component.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0215">Polymer fillers which increase the overall hydrophilicity of the adhesive layer, e.g. PF127, will increase the swelling capacity and/or solubility of the adhesive layer, leading to the eventual failure of bone tape via detachment from bone and/or the side support. On the other hand, polymer fillers which decrease the hydrophilicity of the adhesive layer (e.g. PCL) are desirable to mitigate against bone tape failure due to water ingress in vivo.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="1">Example 13.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, this may be attributed to the ability of non-soluble additives to function as void filling second phase strengthening agents in addition to aiding with energy transfer from the support to the adhesive component during application. Evidence for the role of these particulate additives as void filling second phase strengthening agents can be elucidated from a comparison of devices D-12 against D-14 through D-16 in Table 7, of Device F-1 with F-6, and of Device F-2 with F-7 and F-8, which all show that for a given HA content, the nature of the polymer filler within the adhesive strongly influences the effectiveness of the additive (note that except for PES, the polymer fillers in all of these devices all present similar melting points). Further evidence can be seen in Device F-2 versus F-4, wherein the more porous but compositionally similar TTCP filler makes for a less effective void filling agent compared to HA.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0219">Devices F-1 through F-3 in Table 7 shows the influence of additive pH on device performance. From the prior art, it is known that basic additives induce in situ crosslinking of the catechol moieties of catechol-containing adhesives. This is also apparent in the adhesive devices of this embodiment; residual reactants in the HA additives impart an effective non-neutral pH of the additive. We have found that the effective pH of HA can range from acidic to basic based on the supplier's manufacturing method. When used as-is in the manufacture of bone tape, without further washing to remove the non-neutral impurities, an HA presenting basic pH properties results in in situ pH-induced catechol-catechol crosslinking and/or dimerization under the high-temperature processing conditions of bone tape manufacture. As shown in Table 7 for the devices of this embodiment, however, whilst some improvements in bone tape performance can be had in those devices wherein the adhesives undergo in situ crosslinking/oligomerization (e.g. Device F-1), it is also clearly apparent that these improvements are only marginal (e.g. Device F-2 and F-3). These results reinforce that the adhesives of this embodiment do not require crosslinking for desired adhesive and/or device performance. Further, in the presence of said in situ-induced adhesive crosslinking, the resulting bone tapes are least aesthetically pleasing; with increasing pH-induced crosslinking, the color of adhesive and the resulting bone tape shifts from white towards dark brown/black. Thus, non-crosslinked adhesive devices of the present embodiment, manufactured using particulate additives with pH 7, meet desired aesthetic and performance criteria for use in surgical interventions.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0220">Bone tape with adhesive layers comprising of only the filler polymer PCL, void of adhesive or additives, does not stick to bone.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 14. Influence of Support Composition on Bone Tape Device Performance</heading><p id="p-0280" num="0221">The influence of support side composition was investigated on bone tape Device E. Device E, comprising adhesive Blend 6f on various support side compositions were prepared and assessed for application and adhesion to rabbit zygoma.

In these situations, the challenge is the application of the bone tape without introducing defects into the support side component that would compromise the tensile strength of the device post-surgery. This is especially true for polymers such as PCL with significant crystalline content that undergo rapid melt at temperatures close to or below the tackifying temperature of the adhesive layer. This also applies to polymers which present polymorphic phase transitions and/or which contain multiple polymorphs with phase transitions at or below the tackifying temperature of the adhesive formulation; e.g., PDX presents a final melt temperature at 110&#xb0; C., but also undergoes several polymorphic transitions inclusive of a melt-mediated recrystallization between room temperature and 50&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0224">Polymers which melt/soften at too high temperatures relative to the tackifying temperature of the adhesive formulation (e.g. PLC9517) also present application challenges which translate into compromised device performance. For these systems, the significantly higher temperatures required to soften the support side component in order for it to conform to the shape of the bone surface and thus facilitate the full wetting of the bone surface by the adhesive component actually results in flow out of the adhesive from beneath the bone tape device, leading instead to a compromised device with poor adhesion characteristics. A similar challenge is also observed in polymers with too high elastic moduli (E<sub>tensile</sub>&#x3e;0.5 GPa; e.g. LG824s, PLC8516), which generally require heating well above their glass transition temperatures in order to improve their flexibility enough so that they could sufficiently contour to the shape of the bone.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0225">Generally, polymers with desired melting profile, tensile strength, and/or elastic modulus could be obtained upon blending of individual polymers, e.g. Polymers 3 and 6 in Table 8 above. However, we note that support compositions which do not comprise PCL or copolymers containing PCL generally do not adhere well to the adhesive layer, even with manufacturing tweaks such as the introduction of texture on the support surface of the adhesive-support interface, or laminate-pressing protocols (Table 9). For example, pure PDX backings (Polymer 2) and LG824s (Polymer 5) backings result in delamination of the adhesive layers when the tapes are flexed, regardless of the introduction of texturing at the adhesive-support side interface (Table 9). On the other hand, in a polymer blend, despite being incompatible with nearly all other polymers, PCL (e.g. Polymer blend 3) and/or PCL-containing copolymers (e.g. Polymer blend 6) contribute to lower softening temperatures (Table 8), compatibility with the adhesive layers regardless of manufacturing method (Table 9), and strength retention due to its hydrophobicity (Table 10).</p><p id="p-0286"

Without wishing to be bound by theory, this success is attributed the ultrasound welder's ability to selectively melt or soften the adhesive layer relative to the support polymer layer in situ during the tape application. This selective in situ melting, combined with the constant vibrational forces of the ultrasound under the applied weld forces of the application acted concurrently to displace fluids as well as drive adhesive layer further into bone pores, resulting in the excellent adhesion properties observed. Conversely, the other methods presented non-discriminatory loss of thermal energy to the environment, which necessitated longer heating times and/or higher heating temperatures in order to make the tape conformable and/or the adhesive tacky. In addition to the longer heating times and/or higher heating temperatures, the non-discriminatory loss of thermal energy to the environment presented increased opportunities for both damage of the support polymer layer as well as tissue damage due to excessive/concentrated heating during application. Thus, for tape application using these alternate methods, it was necessary to heat the tape prior to application in order to avoid casting a &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; over the tape and to avoid burns, resulting in non-optimal surgical workflow processes or times. On the other hand, the ultrasonic welder presented desired adhesion with relatively short weld cycles (&#x3c;1 sec per weld), and at weld energies less than 7J, it did not reach or sustain weld temperatures that could result in tissue damage or necrosis (Table 13). For the 70 kHz welder used in these experiments, however, an energy setting of 7J was typically too high, resulting in bone damage upon BoneTape application. This was apparent as bleaching of the bone where it came in contact with the welder and was attributed to excessive heating of the bone during the application which resulted in dehydration. However, charring of the bone was never observed under these conditions, indicating that the welder did not reach and/or sustain the temperatures during application that would result in thermal necrosis of healthy bone. Further, as shown in Table 13, the severity of this heat exposure under such aggressive conditions can be mitigated by increasing the times between consecutive welds.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00016" num="00016"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="308pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 13</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Ultrasound welding temperature profile during application of BoneTape Device</entry></row><row><entry>F-2 onto wet zygoma bone using the 70 kHz ultrasonic welder.

By contrast, the lower frequency welder was substantially more dependent on weld force. This indicates that lower frequency welders are very dependent upon the user's skill (i.e., applied force per weld), whereas the higher frequency welder presents desired application regardless of differences in the application force from user to user.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0233">Both Table 14 and Table 15 also show that the lower frequency unit required more energy, and therefore substantially more time, to complete a weld compared to the higher frequency unit. Moreover, welds performed with the lower frequency unit were generally qualitatively weaker than those prepared with the 70 kHz unit. Since the melting of the adhesive is directly linked to the rate at which energy is supplied, i.e., its power, this result shows that below a given power limit, not enough energy is delivered to melt the adhesive layer within a given weld cycle, whilst at too high power, too much energy is transmitted during the weld cycle, resulting in melting and burn through of the support polymer. Overall, these results show that the higher frequency welder is more advantageous for improved surgical workflow, requiring reduced weld times and/or weld forces to achieve desired welding of bone tape to bone.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0234">The above results also indicate that the ability of BoneTape to tolerate high welding powers are linked to improved procedural utility. Table 16 shows how BoneTape's compositional features influence its ability to tolerate high welding energies and, therefore, high welding powers.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00019" num="00019"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 16</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Influence of composition and thickness on the weldability of BoneTape Device F-2 at different </entry></row><row><entry>welding energies.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Backing</entry><entry>Adhesive</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Thickness/mm</entry><entry>Thickness/mm</entry><entry>Energy</entry><entry>Performance/10</entry><entry>Peel/5</entry><entry>Tension/5</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>0.12</entry><entry>0.16</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>8.5</entry><entry>3.0</entry><entry>5.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>3.5</entry><entry>9.2</entry><entry>3.8</entry><entry>4.9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5.0</entry><entry>9.3</entry><entry>4.3</entry><entry>5.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>0.05</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>9.0</entry><entry>3.5</entry><entry>4.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>3.5</entry><entry>9.4</entry><entry>4.0</entry><entry>4.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5.0</entry><entry>8.7</entry><entry>3.8</entry><entry>4.0</entry></row><row><entry>0.20</entry><entry>0.16</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>8.5</entry><entry>3.5</entry><entry>5.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>3.5</entry><entry>8.25</entry><entry>3.4</entry><entry>4.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5.0</entry><entry>8.9</entry><entry>3.9</entry><entry>4.25</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>0.05</entry><entry>2.5</entry><entry>9.2</entry><entry>3.5</entry><entry>5.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>3.5</entry><entry>9.1</entry><entry>4.0</entry><entry>4.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5.0</entry><entry>9.5</entry><entry>4.25</entry><entry>5.0</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00005">* Control bone tape comprising no heat transfer additive</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0303" num="0235">Table 16 shows that the energy tolerance of BoneTape generally increases with increasing adhesive and/or support polymer layers. For a given support polymer thickness, regardless of the adhesive thickness, increasing the energy could generally increase the performance of the tape, particularly in the peel score, up to a peak energy, after which further increases in the energy lead to a decrease in the overall scores of the tapes. The improvement in performance was most significant for the thinner adhesive layer, with peak energy also occurring sooner for the thinner adhesive layer compared to the thicker adhesive layer. That is, with less adhesive to melt, less energy is required to secure the device onto bone.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0236">Further, Table 16 shows that while excellent adhesion and tension could be achieved with under-optimal energies, maximum peel was only obtained at peak energy. This indicates that the adhesive can form strong tensile bonds with the bone surface once sufficiently softened so as to conform and contact the bone surface without requiring the adhesive itself to become fully flowable. However, for optimal peel, the adhesive must become fully melted and flowable, thereby allowing it to flow into bone pores and/or eliminate fluids from the bone surface. Thus, peel strength appears to be a manifestation of both mechanical and physical bonds. At too high energies, the adhesive likely becomes too fluid such that it flows out of bone tape and is lost. The lower post-peak scores observed in BoneTape comprising the thinner adhesive layers corroborates this.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0237">Table 17 shows the useability of the ultrasonic welder comprising different horn geometries at different application styles.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00020" num="00020"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="315pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 17</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Influence of horn geometry on surgical workflow and BoneTape Device F-2 performance.

Whilst some geometries are ill-suited for bone tape application via a given technique, for example, the coarse horn results in significant tape and/or bone damage when used in the painting motion, other geometries such as the fine geometry works well with any user preferred technique. Generally, the painting technique presents a steeper learning curve since the ultrasonic welder must be held normal to surface for application. However, stamping facilitates initial weld points to anchor BT whilst attachment occurs, making for a more desirable surgical workflow. Overall, these results show the flexibility of bone tape application towards variations in user techniques and, thus, increased procedural utility.</p><heading id="h-0045" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0308" num="0239">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser.
