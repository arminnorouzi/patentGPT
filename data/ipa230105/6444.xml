In particular, in the case of smart grids, the intermittency of the availability of these energy sources as well as the variability of the power produced by them must be taken into account and optimized, in order to ensure a balance between the energy production and its consumption by equipment connected to these grids.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0007">To meet these balance requirements, grid operators have put in place contractual offers for the management of capacity reserves thanks to which, at variable deadlines, additional capacities made available by energy producers may be requested and/or or consumption limits may be imposed according to a pre-established pattern. Thus, in this mode of management, a distinction is usually made between the primary reserve (energy available in a few seconds), the secondary reserve (energy available in a few minutes), and tertiary reserve (energy available or a reduction in energy consumption at a longer time frame than the primary and secondary reserve, generally more than 15 minutes).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">At the individual housing level, it has been suggested to involve some equipments coupled to the electrical grid in this management of capacity reserves.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">Thus, it is known from the document EP-B1-2735067 the measurement and the modulation, in real time, of the electrical consumption of a site, the electrical consumption of one or several devices being interrupted, when necessary. However, this solution requires the installation of a casing (generally placed at the electrical panel of a consumer/producer site whose consumption is to be at least partly deleted), in order to carry out measurements on the electrical grid of the site, and to control the appliances likely to be interrupted. Furthermore, it imposes on the consumer an interruption of service beyond his control. This solution is therefore not suitable, in particular for dwellings equipped with heater operating by means of electricity such as heat pump systems, electrical radiators, due to the discomfort caused by these unexpected interruptions as well as the impossibility of managing the thermal dynamics of the dwelling in an optimized manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">The document EP-B1-2961032 suggests to manage the sharing of resources between producer and/or consumer equipments, by coupling, to an equipment of the grid, a module for analyzing inner data of the equipment, calculate its intrinsic modulation capacity, and send a modulation offer accordingly. This solution also requires the installation of a module on each of the devices likely to participate in the capacity mechanism. Similarly, each deleted equipment does no longer provide service: this solution is therefore also not suitable for dwellings equipped with heater operated by means of electricity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0011">The present disclosure aims at solving all or part of the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">In this context, patent applications EP-A1-3384727 and FR-A1-3059199 have been filed by the Applicant, and suggest the use of an electrical radiator provided with an electrical energy storage device and a heater member adapted to be powered from an electric power supply source (which may include an alternating current electrical grid and/or elements providing direct current) and/or by the electrical energy storage device. Such an electrical radiator is not only capable of providing electric power to cover its own needs, but also to the electrical grid to which it is connected, in order in particular to power other local consuming devices. The use of the energy stored by such an electrical radiator also makes it possible, during a period of consumption cut-off, to ensure continuity of service, which proves to be particularly advantageous for a heating system of a house or building.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">The present disclosure aims at providing additional means for improving the efficiency of energy flow management for a site in which a plurality of electrical radiators are deployed, each provided with an electrical energy storage device and a heater member adapted to be powered by an electric power supply source and/or by the energy storage device. By &#x201c;site&#x201d; it should be understood a space in which an electric power supply source is deployed and in which the plurality of heating appliances is installed, typically a dwelling, a house, a building, or even a district.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The present disclosure also aims at providing resilient means adapted to withstanding the failure or temporary unavailability of one or several equipment(s).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">The present disclosure makes it possible to more generally optimize the management of the energy in an electrical grid.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">This is why there is still a need to provide a resilient micro-grid of heating appliances where at least some of these heating appliances are provided with an electrical energy storage device and a heater member adapted to be selectively powered by the electric power supply source and/or by the energy storage device, which is simple, economical, reliable, easy to implement, and allowing the heating function of the heating appliances of the micro-grid not to be interrupted.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">To this end, according to a first aspect, a micro-grid is suggested including at least:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">a first heating appliance comprising a first electrical energy storage device adapted to be recharged from an electric power supply source, at least one first heater member adapted to be powered from the electrical energy storage device and/or from the first storage device, and a first communication module,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">a second heating appliance comprising a second electrical energy storage device adapted to be recharged from the electrical power supply source, at least one second heater member adapted to be powered from the electrical power supply source and/or from the second electrical energy storage device, and a second communication module,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0020">a supervision module adapted to communicate at least with the second communication module,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">the micro-grid in which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">i) the first communication module is configured to:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">obtain, and transmit to the second communication module, a first set of data comprising:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0024">at least one measurement related to an electrical consumption of the first heating appliance, where said electrical consumption of the first

measurement related to an electrical production of the first heating appliance, where said electrical production of the first heating appliance is an amount of electrical energy consumed by the first heating appliance from the first electrical energy storage device,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0026">and at least one measurement related to an actual state of charge of the first electrical energy storage device,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">control the power supply of the first heater member from the first electrical energy storage device and/or from the

transmit to the supervision module, the first set of data,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0030">obtain and transmit to the supervision module, a second set of data distinct from the first set of data, the second set of data including at least one data related to the electric power supply source and at least one measurement related to an actual state of charge of the second electrical energy storage device,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0031">receive from the supervision module, and transmit to the first communication module, said first state of charge setpoint,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0032">receive, from the supervision module, a second state of charge setpoint related to a target state of charge of the second electrical energy storage device,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0033">control the power supply of the second heater member from the second electrical energy storage device and/or from the electric power source taking into account the measurement related to the actual state of charge of the second electrical energy storage device and of the second state of charge setpoint,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">iii) the supervision module is configured so as to:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">receive the first set of data and the second set of data,</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">generate from the first set of data and the second set of data, and transmit to the second communication module, the first state of charge setpoint and the second state of charge setpoint.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">According to a particular embodiment, the first communication module is configured to control the power supply of the first heater member from the first electrical energy storage device on receipt of an cut-off instruction, while the second communication module is configured so as to transmit, upon receipt of the cut-off instruction destined for the first communication module, said cut-off instruction to the first communication module, the supervision module being configured so as to check whether at least one cut-off instruction of the first heating appliance is satisfied based on the first set of data and the second set of data, and when the cut-off condition is satisfied, transmit to the second communication module said cut-off instruction destined for the first communication module.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">Thus, the supervision module can emit optimized cut-off instructions to the heating appliances of the micro-grid, taking into account data specific to each of the heating appliances&#x2014;such as its electrical consumption, its state of charge&#x2014;and to data related to the electrical grid of the electric power source&#x2014;current total consumption, current production, pricing schedule, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">The first and second sets of data can be collected in real time, that is to say received by the supervision module typically in less than 2 or 3 seconds after obtaining the corresponding measurement or data, and with a frequency of the instruction of collecting the first and second sets of data every 1 to 10 seconds. The disclosure therefore allows a monitoring adapted to the task of optimizing the energy management of the site's electric power source, because it makes it possible to obtain from the supervision module a good reactivity as regards the taking of relevant decisions for the considered energy and time context.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">In addition, when a cut off instruction is received by the first communication module, the first heater member of the first heating appliance to which the first communication module is coupled ceases to use the resources of the electric power source and is powered by means of the first electrical energy storage device. The heating function of the concerned heating appliance is therefore not interrupted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">Furthermore, the supervision module may take into account all the heating appliances of the micro-grid as well as electrical grid status and constraints to determine if the cut-off condition of the first heating appliance is met, allowing decisions that are informed by a overall view of the heating appliances of the micro-grid and of the electrical grid, to be made.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">According to a particular embodiment, said at least one cut-off condition of the first heating appliance includes a condition according to which the measurement related to the actual state of charge of the first electrical energy storage device is above a predetermined charge threshold of the first electrical energy storage device, as a function of at least one data of the data from the first set of data and at least one data of the data from the second set of data.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">It is thus possible to take into account not only the specific features of the first heating appliance, such as the technology of the first electrical energy storage device or its state of charge, but also to dynamically adapt this threshold according to constraints external to the first heating appliance, such as constraints related to the electric power source.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">According to a particular embodiment, the first heating appliance is configured so as to supply the first heater member from the electrical energy source as long as the measurement related to the actual state of charge of the first electrical energy storage device is below a predetermined level of discharge and as long as the cut-off instruction has not been received.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">Thus, when no cut-off instruction is received from the supervision module (for example when the latter is unavailable or faulty), a default operating mode may be implemented, improving the general operation of the micro-grid and its resistance to equipment failures.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">According to a particular embodiment, the first communication module is configured to, upon receipt of a recharging instruction, ensure the recharging of the first electrical energy storage device from the electric power source, while the second communication module is configured so as to transmit, upon receipt of said recharging instruction destined for the first communication module, said recharging instruction to the first communication module, the supervision module being configured to check whether at least one recharging condition of the first electrical energy storage device is satisfied based on the first set of data and the second set of data, and when the recharging condition is satisfied, transmit to the second module communication said recharging instruction destined for the first communication module.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047">According to a particular embodiment, said at least one recharging condition of the first electrical energy storage device includes a condition according to which the measurement related to the actual state of charge of the first electrical energy storage device is below a predetermined charge threshold value of the first electrical energy storage device as a function of at least one data of the data from the first set of data and at least one data of the data from the second set of data.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">Thus, the supervision module may emit recharging instructions optimized for heating appliances of the micro-grid, taking into account data specific to each of the heating appliances (such as its electrical consumption, production capacities, state of charge) and data related to the electric power source (current total consumption, current production, fee scheduling, etc.). It is possible to take into account not only the specific features of the first heating appliance, such as the technology of the electrical energy storage device or its state of charge, but also to dynamically adapt this threshold value as a function of constraints external to the first heating appliance, such as constraints related to the electrical power source.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">According to a particular embodiment, in which the first heating appliance is configured so as to power the first heater member from the first electrical energy storage device as long as the measurement related to the actual state of charge of the first electrical energy storage device is above a predetermined level of charge and as long as the charging instruction is not received.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">Thus, when no charging instruction is received from the supervision module (for example when the latter is unavailable or faulty), a default operating mode may be implemented, improving the general operation of the micro-grid and its resistance to equipment failures.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">According to a particular embodiment, the first set of data includes at least one data of the data chosen from the following list: an information item making it possible to identify the first heating appliance on the micro-grid, a measurement of the power consumed by the first heating appliance, a measurement of the temperature of the environment of the first heating appliance, a temperature setpoint, an information item related to the presence or absence of a user.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">In particular, it is possible to take into account the information related to the environment of the heating appliances of the micro-grid (for example the ambient temperature and the temperature setpoint), and to optimize the management of energy on the electrical grid accordingly.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0053">According to a particular embodiment, the second module of communication is configured to communicate with the supervision module by means of a first access point accessible via the micro-grid, and the second communication module is configured to communicate with the supervision module by means of a first back-up access point accessible via the micro-grid, when the first access point does not make it possible to establish a functional connection with the supervision module.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0054">By having a first backup access point, it is possible to improve the general operation of the micro-grid and its resistance to equipment failures, by having another access in case of unavailability of the first point access, and guarantee the continuity of exchanges with the supervision module.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0055">According to a particular embodiment, the second communication module is adapted, by means of a second access point accessible via the micro-grid, to receive data from a communicating smart electric meter deployed on the electric power source, the second set of data including at least one data related to the electric power source obtained from the smart electric meter.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">Thus, by having access to the information made available by the smart electric meter deployed on the electrical grid, the supervision module may take advantage of these information thus collected to emit optimized cut-off instructions to the heating appliances of the micro-grid, taking into account dynamic data, specific to the electrical grid and/or to the site.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">According to a particular embodiment, the second communication module is adapted, by means of a third access point accessible via the micro-grid, to receive data from an electricity-producing device coupled to the electric power source and/or from an electricity-consuming device powered by the electric power source, the second set data including at least one data related to the production device and/or at least one data related to the consuming device.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">It is thus possible to integrate into the optimized management means of the disclosure, data related to production devices (such as solar panels or energy reserves) and to consuming devices coupled to the electrical grid, other than the heating appliances of the micro-grid, and likely to have a significant impact on the energy available in the electrical grid. Taking this information into account therefore makes it possible to improve the efficiency of charge or cut-off instruction transmissions, and therefore to further improve the overall energy management of the micro-grid, taking into account already installed third-party equipments.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">According to a particular embodiment, the second communication module is configured to record the first set of data and/or the second set of data, when the transmission of the first set of data and/or of the second set of data to the supervision module is not possible, the second communication module being configured to transmit the first set of data as recorded and/or the second set of data as recorded, once the possibility of transmitting the first set of data and/or the second set of data to the supervision module has been restored.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">By providing a degraded management mode in the event of failure of the supervision module or the means of communication allowing data to be transmitted to the supervision module, it is possible to subsequently transmit all the collected data, and thus not to lose significant historical data for emitting charge or cut-off instructions. The reliability of energy management is therefore improved as well as the resistance of the micro-grid to equipment failures.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061">According to a particular embodiment, the micro-grid further includes a third heating appliance provided with a third communication module configured to communicate with the supervision module by means of a secondary access point accessible via the micro-grid, the second communication module being configured to transmit to the third communication module the first set of data and the second set of data, when the second communication module cannot transmit the first set of data and the second set of data to the supervision module, the third communication module being configured so as to:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0062">obtain, and transmit to the supervision module by means of the secondary access point, the first set of data and the second set of data,</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0063">transmit, upon receipt of the cut-off instruction destined for the first communication module by means of the secondary access point, said cut-off instruction to the first communication module.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">By providing such a switchover mechanism to the third communication module in the event of unavailability of the communication means of the second communication module to the management mode, it is possible to immediately transmit all the collected data, and thus not to lose any significant data for the transmission of the charge or cut-off instructions.
