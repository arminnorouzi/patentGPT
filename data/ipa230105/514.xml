DVT starts as a blood clot in the peripheral veins, such as the Iliac or Femoral veins. The blood clot forms because of low blood flow, this can occur from long hours of sitting, for example, flying, or with age, smoking, and other risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. If a DVT clot is not resolved fully, either by lysis or catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT), it transforms from a soft thrombus into a fibrotic collagen-based scar tissue. Unresolved DVT can result in a pulmonary embolism, blocking blood flow to the lungs. Vein blockages can also result in a clinical presentation of swollen or heavy legs, pain, trouble walking, and skin ulcers. If the occlusion is not resolved, the ulcers can progress, however, this is not a disease that is fatal. Despite the pain, patients will often live with these occlusions for years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One challenge facing healthcare providers regarding these occlusions is opening them up. The current treatments such as blood thinners (pharmaceuticals) and compression stockings are mainly ineffective at long-term healing of ulcers and they fail to treat the source of the pain, the occlusion itself. Patient compliance is a major problem with conservative treatments. Compression stockings are often hot, difficult to apply, cause skin damage, and can cost as much as $100 per pair.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Khaja, M. S., Chick, J. F. B., Schuman, A.

veins.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to passing blockages in veins, for example, deep veins. In some embodiments of the invention, the blockage is stable and includes one or both of fibrotic material and collagen, often resembling scar tissue. In some embodiments of the invention, the blockage is total in that it reduces blood flow through the blocked vein by at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or even 100%, or intermediate percentages of the original vein diameter, potentially preventing any blood flow from passing. In some embodiments, enough of the vein is occluded to prevent adequate drainage requiring intervention. In some embodiments of the invention, passing the blockage includes during and/or after passing, creating a flow channel for resuming functionality of the vein for drainage. In some embodiments of the invention, part of the blockage is removed from the body, for example, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or smaller or intermediate or greater percentages, by volume, of a total blockage portion.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments of the invention, a vein blockage penetration system is provided which includes a local stabilizer, such as a balloon, configured to expand and anchor the system near the blockage and a penetration tool which extends through or by the balloon into the blockage. In some embodiments of the invention, the system (e.g., balloon and/or penetration tube) includes a guidewire channel to support delivery over a guidewire. In other embodiments, no guidewire is provided. In some embodiments of the invention, the penetration tool is bendable relative to an elongate longitudinal axis of said system. Optionally or additionally, the penetration tool is rotatable around said longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">A particular feature of some embodiments of the invention relates to vein blockages presenting differently from arterial blockages. Typically, venous fibrotic occlusions present as rubbery like substances that completely occlude the vein. A potential problem with opening such a blockage using a balloon and a stent arises if the physician attempts to track a guidewire across an unopened lesion. The guidewire provides the &#x201c;track&#x201d; for the balloon and stent. Such tracking is often difficult due to the fibrotic and occlusive nature of such lesions. In a typical process, a physician attempts to find microchannels inside the occlusion that will lead the guidewire to the other side. Like a labyrinth, however, there may be multiple &#x201c;dead ends&#x201d; where the physician must retreat and try another passage. Lack of proper imaging often makes the process trial and error with a lot of backtracking. In up to 10% of cases, physicians fail to cross the lesion. In many cases, &#x201c;successful&#x201d; crossing can take up to six hours and uses up to five guidewires. This inability to cross costs the hospital significant time and money. Also, in the USA, when a procedure is aborted only partial reimbursement is provided from insurance companies. In accordance with some embodiments of the invention, a penetration tool capable of penetrating blockages also not via micro-channels may contribute to reducing crossing time.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to penetrating a vein blockage. In some embodiments of the invention, such a vein blockage is stiffer and/or tackier, and or highly elastic like rubber as compared to a fresh thrombus. For example, such a non-fresh thrombus may have been in-situ for over 14, 30, 60, 90 days or intermediate times, or longer, such as up to as long as 10 years.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some embodiments of the invention, penetration is assisted by using a stiffer and/or sharper tool than a guidewire. It is noted that vascular guidewires are often selected for their ability to be atraumatic and flexible. In some embodiments of the invention, the tool is stiff having a high bending modulus and column strength, for example, above 1 GPa. Optionally or additionally, the tool is configured (stiffness, diameter) to be push-able into an elastic material with a Young's modulus above 10 MPa, 100 MPa, 1000 MPa, or intermediate or greater moduli of elasticity. Optionally or additionally, the penetration tool is sharpened. In some embodiments of the invention, the penetration tool includes a hollow tip. Optionally, the hollow tip is used to reduce an effective cross-section of the tool, optionally using vacuum to suck out cored parts of a blockages. Optionally or additionally, the hollow tip is used to receive a stylet which is used for guiding and/or for stiffening of the penetration tool.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments of the invention, a hollow sheath is provided surrounding the penetration tool (e.g., but inside the shaft of the catheter), which hollow sheath may be pre-bent or straight and acts to force at least part of the penetration tool to conform to the geometry of the sheath.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments of the invention, the sheath is pre-bent, additionally or alternatively to the penetration tool being pre-bent. Optionally, this is used to control the direction of penetration, before extension of a penetration tool out of the sheath, by rotation of the sheath. Such control can even be applied while the sheath is maintained straight (e.g., by a surrounding sheath or internal stylet).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments of the invention, the tip of the penetration tool uses energy deposition to assist in penetration, for example, the tip may deliver heat and/or radiation which may soften the blockage potentially providing for easier and/or smoother penetration.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments of the invention, a method of blockage passing comprises penetrating the blockage with a penetration tool, advancing an expandable structure into the blockage, expanding the structure, and further advancing the penetration tool. Optionally, the penetration tool is advanced at an angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the penetration system, for example, being steered.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to a steerable vein penetration tool. In some embodiments of the invention, such steering is used to guide the penetration tool, so it travels within a vein and does not exit the wall of the vein when the vein bends and/or due to deflection by the blockage.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments of the invention, the tool tip is pre-bent but is maintained in a straight configuration by a surrounding sheath, for example, located at least in part within the balloon anchor of the system. When the tip is advanced sufficiently to extend the pre-bent part out of the sheath, the tip bends to the side, providing steering. This embodiment of the tip is optionally made out of shape memory metal, e.g., nitinol. In some embodiments of the invention, the sheath is advanced while enclosing the penetration tip. This may prevent damage to tissue by the tip. When the sheath is retracted, the penetration tip, if pre-bent, can bend. In some embodiments of the invention, such advancing is provided over a space between the blockage passing device and a blockage.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments of the invention, the tool tip includes a pull-wire to selectively straighten and/or bend the tip. The tip may be pre-shaped to bend or to be straight, in some embodiments. Optionally, the pull-wire sits in a groove formed in an outside wall of the penetration tool.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments of the invention, the tool tip is steered using an internal pre-bent stylet. Optionally, the tip includes a weakened part which conforms, at least in part, to the shape of the stylet.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments of the invention, a sheath is provided over the penetration tool (and within the lumen of the device) and which can serve to shape the penetration tip (e.g., maintain it straight or bend it, depending on the design of the sheath). Optionally, the sheath is advanceable and/or rotatable.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">A potential advantage of such steering is to support passage of relatively long and convoluted blocked veins, for example, at least 1 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm long or smaller or intermediate lengths. Optionally, the vein includes a sequence of curves in different plane and possibly with less than 10 cm, 5 cm, 3 cm between curves.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some embodiments of the invention, a tortuous vein includes at least one and optionally two curves, each with a bending radius between 10 and 100 mm. Optionally, the vein has a diameter between 1 and 30 mm.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments of the invention, the veins being treated are not-superficial veins, for example, being deep veins, possibly with insufficient collaterals. When dealing with tortuous veins, it may be important to avoid, or alternatively to go into branching veins. In some embodiments, this is controlled using a steering capability as described herein.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments of the invention, the penetration system is designed with a kink resistance suitable for the tortuosity. For example, the penetration tool, any sheath, and balloon/shaft may have a kink radius of, for example, 20 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm or less or intermediate sizes.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to minimizing spacing between the expanding anchoring element and the blockage. In some embodiments of the invention, the expandable anchor is a balloon and the balloon includes flat or concave distal end, so that the anchoring part of the balloon is closer to the start of the blockage than if a distally tapered balloon were used. In some embodiments of the invention, the distance between the anchoring part of the balloon and the distal tip of the balloon of the blockage is less than 5 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or smaller or intermediate amounts.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments of the invention, the balloon extends distally past the point in the balloon where the penetration tip exits, for example, being 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm or intermediate or more recessed. In some embodiments of the invention, the balloon distal end is shaped like a concave donut, with a rim and central region (e.g., through which the penetration tool extends) more distally extending than a section between them. In some embodiments of the invention, the balloon is shaped like a sphere intersection with a cylinder, so it has flat sides. In some embodiments of the invention, the balloon is spherical, ovoid and/or asymmetrical (e.g., one end flatter than another). In some embodiments of the invention, the balloon is spherical with a proximal taper. Optionally, the balloon is provided in several diameters, for example, between 6 mm and 24 mm, in steps of 2 mm. Optionally or additionally, the balloon is selected to be slightly oversized for the target vessel, for example, between 1 and 3 mm oversized, for example, between 10% and 30% of the vein resting diameter. Optionally, the balloon is between 2 and 30 mm long, for example, between 2 and 10 mm, between 10 and 20 mm and/or between 20 and 30 mm.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to ease of use of a blockage passing system. In some embodiments of the invention, the system uses an anchoring balloon which is repeatedly inflated and deflated. Optionally, the inflation fluid is stored in a handle used to control the system. Optionally or additionally, the handle includes a steering control for, for example, bending and/or rotating a penetration tool relative to the balloon. Optionally or additionally, the handle includes an advancement control for selectively advancing and retracting the penetration tool relative to the balloon.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">If a manipulatable sheath is provided for the penetration tip, a control to manipulate the sheath (e.g., advance/retract, turn and/or bend) is optionally provided in the handle.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to a balloon with a folding directing geometry, for example, in the form of one or more circumferential crimps. In some embodiments of the invention, a circumferential crimp assists in refolding of the balloon when emptied. Optionally or additionally, a circumferential crimp assists in eversion of the balloon during manufacture.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to evaluating tissue type surrounding the tool tip. In some embodiments of the invention, such evaluation is used to detect if a penetration tip is inside an occlusion and/or if such tip is outside of a blood vessel and/or if a surrounding occlusion is less or more stiff and/or if such tip is inside a blood vessel and past an occlusion.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">A potential advantage of such evaluation is that an occlusion may be difficult to image, for example, contrast material cannot easily be injected into it.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments of the invention, a penetration tip with a first geometry has its geometry changed (or attempted to be changed) by an inner stylet and/or an external sheath with a different geometry.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments of the invention, a balance of forces applied to the penetration tip determines if and how much the tip will deform. For example, if the penetration tip is pre-bent and a straight sheath is advanced over the tip, the stiffness of the surrounding tissue may decide if the tip straightens. For example, if the resistance of the tissue plus the resistance of the needle is greater than the force applied by the sheath, the tip will not straighten, or will straighten less or the sheath will follow the curve of the needle. This same calculus applies if a hollow tip is straightened (or bent) using an inserted stylet of different geometry. It is expected that the stiffness of tissue outside a blood vessel, for example, interstitial tissue, is lower than that of a venous obstruction and higher than that of blood.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments of the invention, the stiffness of the tip and its resiliency are selected so that a bent penetration tip will straighten if not in a mature venous occlusion but will straighten the penetration tip when the penetration tip is in an un-occluded lumen of the vessel or outside the lumen.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments of the invention, such behavior of the tip is used to detect if the penetration tip inadvertently exited the vessel and/or to detect if/when an occlusion is traversed. In such cases, the tip is expected to be straightened by the sheath.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments of the invention, the geometry of the tip is identified using an X-ray image. Optionally, one or more fiduciary markers are used to judge the rotational aspect of the tip. Optionally or additionally, an ultrasound imager or other imager is used. Optionally or additionally, a sensor (e.g., a tension sensor or bend sensor) is used to report on the tip geometry.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some embodiments, the presence of an obstruction is determined, at least in part, based on a resistance to advancement of the sheath, such resistance caused, for example, by a need of the sheath to bend and/or friction between the sheath and the tip and/or between the sheath and the surrounding tissue.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments of the invention, the sheath is coated with a hydrophilic coating and/or has a tapered from end and/or is thin, and resistance to its advance is small.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to the design of a bendable penetration tip in the form of a cut hollow tube that is designed to bend in a single plane and including different cuts designs for a bending direction than for a non-bending direction. Optionally, the penetration tip is designed to only bend in one direction. Optionally, the cuts are arranged to encourage bending in only a single plane. Optionally, there is a preferred bending direction. In some embodiments, the cuts define an engagement step including a tab and a wall, by which bending in a certain, ventral, direction is resisted substantially more after the tab abuts against the wall. This has a potential advantage of increasing pushability in a bent state.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Optionally or additionally, the tube, on a dorsal side, opposite to said ventral side includes cuts for flexibility. This has the potential benefit of reducing resistance to shaping by an overtube.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments of the invention, different engagement steps have a different resistance to bending, such that as the penetration tip is bent, an increasing number of steps is engaged. Such engagement potentially increases pushability. In some embodiments of the invention, a compressible or flowable material, such as a polymer material, is provided in gaps defined by the cuts, for example, in the engagement steps. This has the potential benefit of modulating the mechanical properties of the engagement step. Optionally or additionally, this has a potential benefit of aligning the step and the wall. Optionally or additionally, this has the potential benefit of reducing metal-on-metal contact.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some embodiments of the invention, the penetration tip is prebent. Optionally or additionally, the penetration tip is bent be a pull wire.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The cuts may be uniform or they may vary, for example, longitudinally and/or circumferentially (e.g., being arranged in a spiral configuration). This has a potential benefit of defining various shapes for the bent penetration tip other than just a single direction in plane bend.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components and/or methods set forth in the following description and/or illustrated in the drawings and/or the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Exemplary Vein Blockage Penetrator</heading><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic showing of a blocked vein <b>100</b> and a blockage penetrator system (BPS) <b>102</b> for passing a blockage <b>104</b> of vein <b>100</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">As shown a penetration tip <b>106</b> is used to penetrate into blockage <b>104</b>, optionally at an entry point <b>101</b>. An anchor <b>108</b>, optionally a balloon, optionally aims tip <b>106</b> and/or anchors tip <b>106</b> in a transverse direction. A shaft <b>110</b> optionally extends out of the body (e.g., through a vascular port, not shown) and is connected to an optional control handle <b>112</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, handle <b>112</b> includes one or more controls <b>114</b>, for example for relative manipulation of tip <b>106</b> and balloon <b>108</b>, for inflation and/or steering. Optionally or additionally, an inflation chamber <b>116</b> stores inflation fluid for anchor <b>108</b>, in the handle.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments of the invention, BPS <b>102</b> operates by using an expandable anchor <b>108</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, BPS <b>102</b> is in the form of a catheter that is initially tracked over a guidewire to the lesion site. Once the catheter is distal to the lesion, balloon <b>108</b> is inflated. After balloon <b>108</b> is fully expanded, penetration tip <b>106</b> advances distally to puncture the occlusion.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which is a top level flowchart of an operation of BPS <b>102</b>, in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">At <b>150</b>, anchor <b>108</b> (e.g., a balloon) is positioned in a vein near blockage <b>104</b>. As shown below, an optional inverted neck in balloon <b>108</b> allows closer placement of balloon <b>108</b> to blockage <b>104</b> and/or allows expansion of balloon <b>108</b> to clear a larger cross-section of the vein up against the blockage. Optionally, positioning includes inflating balloon <b>108</b> to create space around the catheter and/or to center the catheter in the vein. Optionally or additionally, space creation (e.g., of order of the side of the balloon) is used to reduce the risk that advancement of penetration tip <b>106</b> will penetrate the vein wall.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments of the invention, expansion of the balloon causes reactive forces from the vein wall and compressed blockage material which may serve to center and/or otherwise align BPS <b>102</b>, potentially reducing the risk of inadvertent penetration of vein wall by the penetration tip.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Optionally, at <b>152</b>, penetration tool tip <b>106</b> is aimed at blockage <b>104</b>, for example, using steering of the penetration tool and/or using repositioning and/or reorientation of balloon <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">At <b>154</b>, penetration tip <b>106</b> is advanced into blockage <b>104</b>. Optionally, the penetration tool is advanced, while the anchoring of balloon <b>108</b> prevents relative motion between balloon <b>108</b> and the wall of vein <b>100</b>. This forces penetration tip <b>106</b> to move forward relative to the local vein wall. The sheath defined by balloon <b>108</b> may prevent sideways movement of penetration tip <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">At <b>156</b>, balloon <b>108</b> is optionally advanced into the core created by penetration tip <b>106</b>, for example, being first deflated and/or with penetration tip <b>106</b> retracted. The process is now optionally repeated one or more times (e.g. supporting an earthworm-like movement). It is noted that expansion of balloon <b>108</b> inside blockage <b>104</b> may widen a channel therethrough and/or may be provided together or as a preliminary to stent delivery inside blockage <b>104</b>. For example, a guidewire may be provided through BPS <b>102</b> and after blockage coring, BPS <b>102</b> may be withdrawn leaving the guidewire in place for guiding stent placement. Optionally, standard balloons and stents will then follow along the guidewire.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments of the invention, BPS <b>102</b> is used to recanalize chronically occluded peripheral veins including the Iliac, Femoral, and/or Inferior Vena Cava. Additionally, the catheter can also be used for recanalizing occluded dialysis access channels such as central veins, e.g. brachiocephalic and/or external jugular, that are occluded after the long-term indwelling of a central venous catheter (CVC) and/or arteriovenous fistulas (AVF's) created for hemodialysis access. Optionally, BPS <b>102</b> is used with a guidewire as a first-in-line device.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments of the invention, penetration tip <b>106</b> is a distal end of an elongate penetration tool extending from handle <b>112</b> through shaft <b>110</b> and past anchor <b>108</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the penetration tool is shorter (e.g., between 1 and 15 cm) and may be attached to an extension which extends outside the body.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In some embodiments of the invention, penetration tip <b>106</b> is sized as a standard-gauge needle, for example, a 16, 17, 18, or 19-gauge needle and/or optionally includes a long distal taper to allow for penetration and subsequent enlargement of the newly created channel. In some embodiments of the invention, the needle is hollow to allow for passage of a guidewire, for example, a 0.035&#x2033; guidewire.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The penetration tool is optionally constructed out of either shape memory metal or super-elastic material, such as nitinol, or a stiffer but laser cut design made from Cobalt-Chromium. Optionally or additionally, the penetration tool is made of stainless steel. Optionally or additionally, the penetration tool is constructed using different materials or mixtures of materials at different locations, such as tip, body and bending location. For example, a Co&#x2014;Cr tip may be used with a stainless-steel shaft; this may cut down on costs.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Shaft <b>110</b> may be a standard catheter shaft, for example, an extruded polymer with a stainless-steel braid and PTFE liner. Optionally, shaft <b>110</b> includes multiple layers, for example, defining an outer or side lumen for inflating anchor <b>108</b> and a central lumen for said penetration tool. In some embodiments of the invention, shaft <b>110</b> is designed to have high push-ability, column strength, and flexibility using HHS tubing attached to the penetration tool and/or braided shaft with a PTFE liner and PEBAX or Nylon outer layer. In some embodiments of the invention, the shaft is constructed of extruded PEBAX with a reflowed braid and inner PTFE liner.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In some embodiments of the invention, handle <b>112</b> is in the form of an ergonomic injection molded (e.g., as a clamshell) with multiple actuators (e.g., one or more of dials, slides, and/or thumbwheels). Control <b>114</b> may be operative to smoothly inflate balloon <b>108</b> and to smoothly actuate the penetration tool in synchronization, and provide advancement and penetration, as described herein. In one example, a plunger used for inflation has a first travel distance where it is coupled to a fluid filled chamber, to force that chamber into the balloon and a further travel distance which mechanically couples to and advances the penetration tip. The plunger may decouple from the inflation mechanism once it reaches the end of the first travel distance (e.g., the plunger including a protrusion and the inflation mechanism and penetration tip being coupled to a matching recess or protrusion which interferes with the protrusion. An audible and/or tactile click may be used to inform the user of this change over. Handle <b>112</b> optionally includes a control (e.g., a dial) for steering tip <b>106</b>.

It is noted, however, that veins have some elasticity and that expanding a balloon the diameter of the unblocked vein is expected to compress the blockage against the vein walls and possibly somewhat expand the vein diameter. Some recoil may be expected. However, such recoil is expected to be less than 100%, so a patent channel is maintained. A potential advantage of a balloon or other expandable structure with a relatively continuous and flattened surface is that the force applied by the balloon to the vein wall is more evenly distributed and less likely to damage the vein wall. In some embodiments of the invention, inflation is between 2 and 30 atm, for example, between 5 and 23, for example, up to about 20 atm.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">In some embodiments of the invention, balloon <b>208</b> is symmetrical and serves to center BPS <b>202</b> in the vein.

In some embodiments of the invention, the spacing between the engagement steps and/or within the engagement steps is used to set the shape of the curve.

A potential advantage of such an arrangement is balloon distal end <b>2248</b> can be placed at a distal most end of system <b>2202</b>. Balloon <b>2208</b> can potentially be used to manipulate a penetration tool tip while having a control and small area of expansion.

However, contrast material is somewhat toxic to patients, so avoidance thereof is beneficial. Also, contrast material injected into an obstruction, or a muscle might not spread enough to show an outline of a nearby blood vessel.
