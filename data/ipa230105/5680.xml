Then, the manipulation knob <b>120</b> is pushed upward due to recovery forces generated by the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> and metal dome switch <b>135</b> at that time, and the manipulation knob <b>120</b> returns to the predetermined initial position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, with the multi-directional input device <b>100</b> according an embodiment, when a sliding manipulation is performed on the manipulation knob <b>120</b>, the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> is first pressed down by the push-rod <b>138</b> and is placed in the on-state, after which the metal dome switch <b>135</b> is pressed down by the actuator <b>136</b> and is placed in the on-state. Thus, with the multi-directional input device <b>100</b> according an embodiment, even when a sliding manipulation is performed on the manipulation knob <b>120</b>, it is possible to present a sound and a click manipulation feeling to the manipulator with the metal dome switch <b>135</b>. Timings at which to press down the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> and metal dome switch <b>135</b> and timings at which to shift the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> and metal dome switch <b>135</b> to the on-state can be varied by setting the inclination angles of the cam surfaces <b>123</b> and <b>143</b> and other parameters in consideration of the amounts of strokes of the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> and metal dome switch <b>135</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, the multi-directional input device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment has: the manipulation knob <b>120</b> for which a movement manipulation in a horizontal direction and a pressing-down manipulation in a perpendicular direction are possible; the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> that is switched to the on-state when the sliding manipulation is performed on the manipulation knob <b>120</b>; and the metal dome switch <b>135</b> that is pressed down both when the sliding manipulation is performed on the manipulation knob <b>120</b> and when the pressing-down manipulation is performed on the manipulation knob <b>120</b>, by which the metal dome switch <b>135</b> generates a different manipulation feeling than the rubber dome switch <b>137</b> and is switched to the on-state.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">With the multi-directional input device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment, therefore, a sound and a click manipulation feeling can be generated by a single metal dome switch <b>135</b> both in a sliding manipulation on the manipulation knob <b>120</b> and in a pressing-down manipulation on the manipulation knob <b>120</b>. Therefore, the multi-directional input device <b>100</b> in an embodiment can reduce the number of switches used to generate a manipulation feeling can be reduced, making it possible to reduce the size and price of the multi-directional input device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">This completes the description of an embodiment of the present invention.
