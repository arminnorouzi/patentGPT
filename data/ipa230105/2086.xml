The ability to control pouch weight consistently at the pouch making equipment is affected by the consistency of the tobacco used. The more consistent the tobacco characteristics are, the better the pouch maker will operate. When sticky/clumpy tobacco is used in the production, pouch weight can be difficult to control. Moreover, when the tobacco is fed from bulk storage containers into the pouch making machinery, it can be difficult to provide consistent material characteristics. Many times, tobacco coming from bulk storage containers is stuck together in clumps.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described herein, sifter <b>30</b> is arranged downstream of bulk material feeder <b>20</b> and upstream of pouch making machine <b>60</b>, and is used to de-clump the granular material in order to provide consistent granular material.

The number of pouches may be weighed, the weight of the number of pouches may be compared to an upper threshold and a lower threshold, and the volume of cavity <b>240</b> may be adjusted based on comparing the determined weight to the upper and lower thresholds. For example, when the determined weight is less than the lower threshold, then pin <b>235</b> is moved downward in hole <b>245</b>, thereby making cavity <b>240</b> larger and increasing the mass of granular material per pouch.

For example, in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, pressure source <b>265</b> is applied to bore <b>250</b><i>a </i>for a predetermined amount of time, while vacuum source <b>260</b> is applied to bore <b>250</b><i>b</i>. The vacuum remains on bore <b>235</b><i>b </i>while tube moves from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. When tube <b>215</b> is aligned over hole <b>210</b><i>b</i>, vacuum source <b>260</b> is disconnected from bore <b>250</b><i>b </i>and pressure source <b>265</b> is connected to bore <b>250</b><i>b </i>for a predetermined amount of time. Concurrently, vacuum source <b>260</b> is connected to bore <b>250</b><i>a </i>to assist in filling cavity <b>240</b><i>a </i>with granular material. Vacuum source <b>260</b> remains connected to bore <b>250</b><i>a </i>until tube <b>215</b> moves back to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The amount of vacuum may be within a range of 0 to 10 inches of mercury, although any suitable amount of vacuum may be used within the scope of the invention. Each pin <b>235</b><i>a </i>and <b>235</b><i>b </i>may be connected to a respective valve <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b</i>, which may be controlled by a controller (e.g., controller <b>270</b> as described herein).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows portions of an exemplary measuring system <b>50</b> including twenty pins <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<i>t</i>, which may be used in a ten lane system such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>. In embodiments, the respective valve associated with each respective pin is connected to a vacuum manifold <b>300</b> and a pressure manifold <b>305</b>. For example, pin <b>235</b><i>a </i>is connected to valve <b>255</b><i>a </i>(e.g., in a manner similar to that described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), with valve <b>255</b><i>a </i>being connected to vacuum manifold <b>300</b> and a pressure manifold <b>305</b>. The vacuum manifold <b>300</b> is connected to vacuum source <b>260</b>, and pressure manifold <b>305</b> is connected to pressure source <b>265</b>. Structure <b>310</b> may house all the valves associated with all the respective pins <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<i>t</i>. Structure <b>310</b> may additionally or alternatively house manual and/or automated mechanisms for adjusting the height of pins <b>235</b><i>a</i>-<i>t </i>to adjust cavity volumes as described herein, either individually or as a group.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The system as described herein may thus include ten lanes, with each lane including one tube <b>215</b>, one conduit <b>225</b>, two holes <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b</i>, two cavities <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b</i>, and two pins <b>235</b><i>a </i>and <b>235</b><i>b</i>. All ten tubes and conduits may be moved as a group in a reciprocating fashion, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, between a first position over a first ten holes and a second position over a second ten holes. When the ten tubes are in the first position over the first ten holes, a first ten measured portions of granular material are moved from a first ten cavities to the pouch making machine, while a second ten cavities are simultaneously filled with granular material from the hopper cavity. When the ten tubes are in the second position over the second ten holes, a second ten measured portions of granular material are moved from a second ten cavities to the pouch making machine, while the first ten cavities are simultaneously filled with granular material from the hopper cavity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In embodiments, a level sensor may be used to maintain a proper level of granular material in hopper cavity <b>190</b>. For example, a laser sensor, electronic eye, or the like, may be used to detect when the amount of granular material in hopper cavity <b>190</b> falls below a predefined threshold. Any desired number and/or type(s) of level sensors may be used. A controller may be connected to the level sensor. The controller connected to the level sensor may be the same as controller <b>270</b>, or may be a different controller. When the level sensor detects the amount of granular material in hopper cavity <b>190</b> falls below a predefined threshold, the controller may activate the sifter <b>30</b> for a predefined amount of sifting time (e.g., 2 seconds) to move granular material from the sifter <b>30</b> to the hopper <b>40</b>. Activating the sifter <b>30</b> may include, for example, the controller sending a signal to electric motor <b>155</b> to cause rotation of shaft <b>150</b> that moves wipers <b>145</b> for the predefined amount of sifting time.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the predefined amount of sifting time, in the event the level sensor indicates the level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b> is above the predefined threshold, then the controller turns off sifter <b>30</b>. On the other hand, in the event the level sensor indicates the level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b> is still below the predefined threshold after the predefined amount of sifting time, then the controller causes the system to agitate feeder <b>20</b> for a predefined amount of feeder time to move granular material from feeder <b>20</b> to sifter <b>30</b>. Agitating feeder <b>20</b> may include, for example, the controller sending a signal to an actuator (e.g., an electric motor) that causes vibration of pans <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of feeder <b>20</b> for the predefined amount of feeder time, which causes granular material to move from feeder <b>20</b> into sifter <b>30</b>. In aspects, the controller also activates sifter <b>30</b> while agitating feeder <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">After the predefined amount of feeder time, in the event the level sensor indicates the level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b> is above the predefined threshold, then the controller turns off feeder <b>20</b> and sifter <b>30</b>. On the other hand, in the event the level sensor indicates the level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b> is still below the predefined threshold after the predefined amount of sifting time, then the controller causes the system to agitate feeder <b>20</b> and activate sifter <b>30</b> again for the predefined amount of feeder time. In this manner, the system may keep feeder <b>20</b> and sifter <b>30</b> turned on until the level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b> reaches the desired level.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described herein, various aspects of system <b>10</b> may be controlled using a controller, such as a programmable computer device or the like. For example, controller <b>270</b> may be operatively connected to elements of system <b>10</b> and adapted to control at least one of the following functions: detecting level of granular material in hopper <b>40</b>; agitating feeder <b>20</b>; moving wipers <b>145</b> in sifter <b>30</b>; moving slide <b>200</b>; controlling valve <b>255</b>; moving conveyor <b>70</b>; tracking positions of containers <b>80</b> on conveyor <b>70</b> and/or throughout the system; weighing pouches in containers and comparing the weight to thresholds; and adjusting height of pins <b>235</b> in holes <b>210</b> based on the comparing. For example, controller <b>270</b> may be configured to coordinate the timing of the movement of slide <b>200</b> with the control of valve <b>255</b>, such that vacuum or pressure is appropriately applied to bore <b>250</b> based on the position of tube <b>215</b> over cavity <b>240</b> (e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>). The invention is not limited to a single controller performing these functions, and any desired number and/or type of controllers may be used. The controller(s) may be operatively connected to sensors and/or actuators, e.g., as described herein, in order to perform one or more of these functions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of a method in accordance herewith. Methods in accordance herewith may be performed using the systems described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>15</b></figref> and in a manner similar to that described with respect to those figures. The steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> are described in part by referring to reference numbers associated with elements shown in the previous drawings. At step <b>410</b> the system provides bulk granular material (e.g., tobacco), e.g., to sifter <b>30</b>. This may comprise, for example, providing bulk granular material to feeder <b>20</b> and/or agitating feeder <b>20</b> to cause the bulk granular material to fall out of feeder <b>20</b> into sifter <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step <b>420</b>, the system sifts the bulk granular material. In embodiments, this includes sifting the bulk granular material through screens <b>140</b> in sifter <b>145</b>, This may optionally include moving wipers <b>145</b> to assist in sifting the bulk granular material through screens <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>430</b>, the system measures a portion of the sifted granular material. In embodiments, the measuring includes moving a portion of the granular material from the hopper cavity <b>190</b> to a measuring cavity <b>240</b>, e.g., as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>14</b></figref>. Step <b>430</b> may include uncovering a cavity <b>240</b> and moving granular material <b>245</b> into the cavity <b>240</b> by gravity and/or vacuum (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), and trimming excess granular material <b>245</b> away from over the cavity (e.g., as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>440</b>, the system moves the measured portion of granular material to a pouch making machine. This may include ejecting the measured portion of granular material from the measuring cavity <b>240</b> using compressed air, which causes the measured portion of granular material to travel through tube <b>215</b> and conduit <b>225</b> to pouch making machine <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>450</b>, the system makes a pouch encapsulating the measured portion of granular material. This may include, for example, pouch making machine <b>60</b> forming a pouch using conventional pouch making processes. At step <b>460</b>, the system places the pouch in a container, e.g., container <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After step <b>440</b>, one branch of the process loops back to step <b>430</b>. In this manner, the system continues to measure new portions of the granular material concurrently while the pouch making machine is processing previous measured portions of granular material.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At optional step <b>470</b>, the system detects the weight of one or more pouches, compares the weight to upper and lower thresholds, and adjusts the measuring system based on the comparing, if necessary. Step <b>470</b> may include one of: moving pin <b>235</b> downward in hole <b>245</b>, thereby making cavity <b>240</b> larger and increasing the mass of granular material per pouch, when the determined weight is less than the lower threshold; moving pin <b>235</b> upward in hole <b>245</b>, thereby making cavity <b>240</b> smaller and decreasing the mass of granular material per pouch, when the determined weight is more than the upper threshold; and not moving pin <b>235</b> when the determined weight is between the lower threshold and upper threshold. After step <b>470</b>, the process returns to step <b>430</b> to continue measuring portions of the granular material.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of systems and methods according to the present disclosure have been presented.
