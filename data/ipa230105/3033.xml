More particularly, the invention relates to floor panels which can be coupled to each other by means of mechanical coupling parts.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The aim of the invention is that a floor covering of such floor panels can be installed easily, however, that simultaneously also sufficient strength is obtained in the floor covering, more particularly sufficiently strong connections can be realized among the floor panels, such in combination with production techniques which keep the production costs limited.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Primarily, the invention relates to floor panels which can be installed by means of the so-called fold-down technique, such in order to be able to fulfill the targeted requirement of a simple installation. A fact herein is that two of the edges, in the case of oblong floor panels mostly the short edges, must be able to be joined to each other by means of a downward movement, bringing about a vertical locking. A good vertical locking can be realized by means of separate elastic locking strips. An example of such approach is disclosed in WO2017/068523.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, realizing and providing the separate elastic locking strips is expensive. In order to exclude these costs, one-piece or substantially one-piece coupling profiles can be used for the edges of floor panels to be joined by a downward movement thereby creating a vertical locking. Such approach is disclosed in WO2017/115202, WO2018/172955, WO2019/137964, WO2019/082141, US2015/0267418A1, US2013/0276398A1 and US2017/0241136A1. However, it is known that such coupling parts realized in one piece mostly offer a less stable connection; either the connection is too taut and the floor panels cannot be joined to each other or can only be joined together by damaging them, or the coupling offers too little resistance against unlocking. It seems that the quality of the coupling is extremely dependent on configuration details and applied materials.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an objective of this invention to provide coupling parts that allow coupling edges of a floor panel by means of a downward movement wherein a vertical locking is provided between the coupled edges that show one or more improvements over the prior art.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention specifically provides floor panels with coupling parts that are easier to produce; and that allow coupling edges of a floor panel by means of a downward movement whereby a vertical locking is provided between the coupled edges. More specifically, the present invention provides floor panels that can be installed by means of the fold-down technique, that can be produced more easily and wherein the installed floor panels can be un-installed by means of a turning movement. This un-installing&#x2014;involving unlocking&#x2014;can be required when errors have been made during installation of the floor panel. This unlocking is also required when the floor panels are removed in order to install them in another room, e.g. when moving from one house to another house. This unlocking is also required when a floor panel is damaged and replacement of the damaged floor panel by another floor panel is envisaged.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is a floor panel for forming a floor covering. The floor panel comprises a first pair of opposite edges, as well as a second pair of opposite edges. The first pair of opposite edges comprises coupling parts, which allow that two of such floor panels mutually can be coupled to each other. The coupling parts of the first pair of opposite edges show the following characteristics:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">the coupling parts comprise a horizontally active locking system, which, in a coupled condition of two of such floor panels, effects a locking in the plane of the floor panels and perpendicular to the respective edges;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">the coupling parts also comprise a vertically active locking system, which, in a coupled condition of two of such floor panels, effects a locking transverse to the plane of the floor panels;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">the coupling parts substantially are realized from the material of the floor panel itself. The second pair of opposite edges also comprises coupling parts on both edges, which allow that two of such floor panels mutually can be coupled to each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The coupling parts at the second pair of opposite edges show the following characteristics:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">the coupling parts comprise a horizontally active locking system, which, in a coupled condition of two of such floor panels, effects a locking in the plane of the floor panels and perpendicular to the respective edges;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the coupling parts also comprise a vertically active locking system, which, in a coupled condition of two of such floor panels, effects a locking transverse to the plane of the floor panels;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the coupling parts substantially are realized from the material of the floor panel itself.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The horizontally active locking system of the second pair of edges is formed at least of an upward-directed lower hook-shaped part which is situated on one of said two edges, as well as a downward-directed upper hook-shaped part, which is situated on the opposite edge. The upward-directed lower hook-shaped part consists of a lip with an upward-directed locking element, which proximally thereof defines a female part in the form of a recess. The downward-directed upper hook-shaped part consists of a lip with a downward-directed locking element forming a male part. The coupling parts of the second pair of opposing edges are configured such that two of such floor panels can be coupled to each other at their respective edges by means of a downward movement&#x2014;preferably involving a downward snapping movement&#x2014;of the one floor panel in respect to the other. The vertically active locking system of the second pair of opposing edges comprises vertically active locking parts, which, by means of respective locking surfaces, define at least a first vertical locking zone and a second vertical locking zone. In coupled condition of two such panels the first vertical locking zone is located at the distal end of the upward-directed locking element. In coupled condition of two such panels the second vertical locking zone is situated at the distal end of the downward-directed locking element. The aforementioned vertically active locking parts comprise a first locking part at the edge of the panel at the proximal end of the lip of the upper hook-shaped part, a second locking part at the distal end of the downward-directed locking element, as well as a third locking part at the distal end of the lip of the lower hook-shaped part and a fourth locking part at the proximal end of the female part. The first and the third locking part, in the coupled condition of two of such floor panels, define the first vertical locking zone; The second and the fourth locking part, in the coupled condition of two of such floor panels, define the second vertical locking zone.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Floor panels according to the invention can be installed more easily as less force is required when coupling the floor panels to each other.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the invention creates that installed floor panels can be uninstalled in an easy way. E.g. by unlocking and removing&#x2014;by means of a turning movement&#x2014;a row of panels; and then again by turning movements, removing the individual floor panels from the removed row of panels. This is made possible by the configuration of the coupling parts at the second pair of opposite edges.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, in coupled condition at the second pair of edges of two such floor panels, no vertical locking is provided between the proximal end of the downward-directed locking element and the proximal end of the upward-directed locking element. Such embodiments facilitate the coupling of the floor panels, meaning that less force is required to couple floor panels at the second pair of edges when installing such floor panels. Furthermore, floor panels according to such embodiments can be more easily uncoupled from installed floor coverings.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the floor panel is configured such that the first vertical locking zone and the second vertical locking zone are the only zones where a vertical locking is provided in coupled condition of two such floor panels between the edges of their second pair of opposite edges. Such embodiments facilitate the coupling of the floor panels, meaning that less force is required to couple floor panels at the second pair of edges when installing such floor panels. Furthermore, floor panels according to such embodiments can be more easily uncoupled from installed floor coverings.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the first vertical locking zone is provided at least at &#x2154; of the thickness of the floor panel from the surface of the floor panel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the angle between the proximal end of the downward-directed locking element and the horizontal direction in the proximal direction of the upper hook-shaped part is less than 90&#xb0;, preferably less than 80&#xb0;, preferably more than 60&#xb0;, e.g. 75&#xb0; or e.g. 86&#xb0;.

Such pretension can be created when there is an overlap of the downward-directed locking element and the upward-directed locking element, such that when coupling two such floor panels, the one locking element has to push away the other locking element. More preferably, this results in an elastic bending&#x2014;creating the pretension&#x2014;of the lip with the upward-directed locking element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternative preferred embodiment, in coupled condition at the second pair of edges of two such floor panels, the proximal end of the downward-directed locking element contacts the proximal end of the upward-directed locking element without pretension.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In preferred floor panels, the second locking part is provided by a first undercut at the distal end of the downward-directed locking element.

The panel is coupled to the already installed panel by means of a downward movement. The operation of the installation of the floor panel is facilitated as the panel can be brought closer to the edge of the already installed panel while being turned already lower, as the absence over a certain length of the upward-directed lower hook-shaped part means removal of a potential obstacle for the easy coupling of the panels.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In a preferred floor panel according to the invention, the edge of the second pair of opposite edges comprising the upward-directed lower hook-shaped part comprises a first vertical closing plane.
