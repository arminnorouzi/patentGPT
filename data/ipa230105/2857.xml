Bearings for the motor fuel pumps are required to have high slidability and abrasion resistance.

Utilization of the aluminum bronze-based alloy enables reduction of the amount of added Ni that is expensive to 6% by mass or less and leads to material cost reduction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, since Al powder and alloy powder containing Al have a nature that they are easily oxidized, it is difficult to obtain a sintered body through sintering, and an improvement in a sinterability is a task.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In other words, since the Al powder or the alloy containing Al is likely to generate oxide coating on the surface thereof, and the oxide coating has high stability, presence of the oxide coating may be a factor of inhibiting the sinterability in a sintering atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to improve the sinterability, fluoride such as aluminum fluoride or calcium fluoride is blended as a sintering aid in the raw material powder. Moreover, it is desirable that the molded article be sintered inside a box made of metal or the like. Also, it is necessary to add adjustment such as selection of gas that minimizes oxidation for a sintering protection atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, according to the aforementioned method for improving sinterability, sintering efficiency is low, and sintering step cost increases. Moreover, there is a problem that if the sintering aid is decomposed during sintering, and fluorine gas is generated, there is a problem that deterioration of a sintering furnace material is accelerated.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As a result of the present inventor's intensive studies in order to improve sinterability of aluminum bronze in the aforementioned background, the present inventor discovered that adding pure Al powder to Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and mixing them to produce raw material powder was effective for improving sinterability of an aluminum bronze-based sintered alloy containing Ni. In other words, the present inventor discovered that if powder compacting molding was performed using the raw material powder to form a molded article, and the molded article was sintered in a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas that contains 3% by volume or more of hydrogen gas, then sintering advanced without addition of any sintering aid, and a sintered body with relatively high strength was able to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Note that the present inventor also obtained knowledge that the strength of the sintered body was further improved if a sintering aid such as aluminum fluoride or calcium fluoride is used as needed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention was made in view of the circumstances described above, and an objective thereof is to provide a method for manufacturing a Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based sintered alloy that enables sintering without using a sintering aid by a combination of Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder as a method for manufacturing an aluminum bronze-based sintered alloy containing Ni.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(1) In order to solve the problem, a method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to an aspect of the present invention (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention&#x201d;) includes: adding a predetermined amount of the pure Al powder to Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and mixing them to produce raw material powder with a composition ratio of Ni: 1% to 15% by mass, Al: 1.9% to 15% by mass, and a Cu balance containing inevitable impurities; compacting the raw material powder to form a green compact; and sintering the green compact in a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas that contains 3% by volume or more of hydrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The sintering atmosphere may be a reducing atmosphere containing 3% by volume or more of hydrogen gas and containing nitrogen gas. Examples of the reducing atmosphere include atmospheres of mixture gas of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas and of mixture gas of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas obtained by diluting, with nitrogen gas, decomposed ammonia gas (mixture gas of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas manufactured by decomposing ammonia gas).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that for manufacturing a bearing product, sizing is performed after the sintering in the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, and oil immersion of lubricant oil is then performed as needed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">(2) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, the step of sintering may be performed in an atmosphere of a mixture gas of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas, the mixture gas containing 3% by volume or more of hydrogen gas and being obtained by diluting a decomposed ammonia gas, which is made of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas, with nitrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present inventor discovered that the green compact obtained through powder compacting molding using the raw material powder obtained by adding predetermined amounts of Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder and mixing them has an effect that a sintering reaction of the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder and the pure Al powder advances in the sintering step.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In other words, the combination of the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder is essential, and the sintering reaction hardly advances with other combinations, for example, a combination of Cu&#x2014;Ni two-element alloy powder with no Al as a component of the alloy powder and the pure Al powder. The reason is considered as follows.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, the pure Al powder is melted at about 660&#xb0; C. (that is a melting point of Al) in the process of a temperature rise to the sintering temperature of 880&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C. in the step of sintering the green compact made of the raw material powder as a combination of the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder, and a liquid phase is thus generated. The liquid phase has satisfactory wettability with a Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder surface containing Cu, Ni, and Al, and a sintering reaction through liquid phase sintering thus advances. On the other hand, if alloy powder that does not contain Al is used, it is considered that sintering is less likely to advance even in the liquid phase sintering state due to poor wettability with the liquid phase generated from the pure Al powder.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a case in which the amount of added pure Al powder is small, an effect of promoting sintering through liquid phase sintering cannot be obtained, and targeted strength cannot be obtained. In a case in which the amount of added pure Al powder is too large, an Al-rich phase appears, and corrosion resistance deteriorates, which is not favorable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, in order to cause the sintering to advance, it is important to perform the sintering in a reducing atmosphere of nitrogen gas containing 3% by volume or more of hydrogen gas (for example, a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas or a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas obtained by diluting decomposed ammonia gas (mixture gas of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas obtained through decomposition of ammonia gas) with nitrogen gas). It is possible to cause sintering to advance with an oxide coating generated by the liquid phase generated from the pure Al powder on the surface of the alloy powder broken, by performing the sintering of the green compact made of the aforementioned raw material powder of the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder in the mixture gas atmosphere. It is thus possible to obtain a sintered alloy with high compressed environment strength.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(3) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, a mixed powder containing the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder such that a content of the pure Al powder is 0.9% to 12% by mass may be used as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">(4) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, a mixed powder containing Cu-1% to 15% Ni-1% to 12% Al alloy powder and 0.9% to 12% of the pure Al powder by mass may be used as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(5) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, a raw material powder containing 1.0% to 8.0% of graphite by mass in addition to the composition may be used as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(6) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, a raw material powder containing 0.1% to 0.9% of P by mass in addition to the composition may be used as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(7) In the present invention, a raw material powder containing 0.02% to 0.2% of sintering aid made of at least one of aluminum fluoride and calcium fluoride by mass in addition to the composition may be used as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(8) In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, a raw material powder to which at least one kind or two or more kinds of powders among a Ni powder, a Cu&#x2014;P alloy powder, a Ni&#x2014;P alloy powder, and a graphite powder are added in addition to the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and the pure Al powder may be used as the raw material powder.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present invention, the pure Al powder promotes the sintering in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based raw material powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al by becoming a liquid phase during the sintering with the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al and causing a reaction. It is thus possible to obtain a sintered alloy with high compressed environment strength and excellent abrasion resistance and corrosion resistance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0017" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING(S)</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The FIGURE is a perspective view showing an example of a bearing part formed of a sintered alloy according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0018" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The FIGURE shows a bearing part <b>1</b> with a cylindrical shape made of a sintered alloy according to the present embodiment, and the bearing part <b>1</b> is used as a bearing to be incorporated in a motor fuel pump for an engine or the like in one example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sintered alloy constituting the bearing part <b>1</b> has a composition containing Ni: 1% to 15% by mass and Al: 1.9% to 15% by mass and balances consisting of Cu and inevitable impurities.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although not particularly limited, the sintered alloy constituting the bearing part <b>1</b> may have a composition containing Ni: 4% to 12% and Al: 5% to 14.5% by mass and balances consisting of Cu and inevitable impurities or may have a composition containing Ni: 6% to 11% and Al: 10% to 14% by mass and balances consisting of Cu and inevitable impurities.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a texture of the sintered alloy constituting the bearing part <b>1</b>, some sintered alloy has a sintered texture in which amorphous alloy grains containing Cu, Ni, and Al are bonded via a plurality of grain boundaries (including a binder phase consisting of pure Al).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that % for indicating content of elements means % by mass in the following description unless particularly indicated otherwise.

If the content of the pure Al powder with respect to the entire mixed powder (raw material powder) is less than 0.9%, a sintering promotion effect becomes insufficient, and desired hardness and strength of the sintered alloy cannot be obtained.

Since there are air, nitrogen gas, and the like as fluids used in the atomizing method, inevitable impurities are mixed from impurities contained in oxygen and nitrogen, a furnace material used in the atomizing method, and the Al feed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Since a small amount of oxygen in the pure Al powder leads to a higher sintering promotion effect, pure Al powder manufactured by the atomizing method using nitrogen gas is preferably employed. Also, it is possible to obtain the sinterability promotion effect even with pure Al powder obtained by the air atomizing method as long as it is possible to control it containing low oxygen depending on powder manufacturing conditions. Although it is possible to obtain the sintering promotion effect if the amount of oxygen in the pure Al powder is 0.2% or less, the amount of oxygen contained in the atomized powder is preferably 0.1% or less.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The content of Al contained in powder that can be used as the pure Al powder is 97% or more to 100%.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">&#x201c;Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-Based Alloy Powder Containing Cu, Ni, and Al&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As an example of the alloy powder containing Cu, Ni, and Al, it is possible to use a Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder. The Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder reacts with the liquid phase generated from the pure Al powder during sintering, and the sintering in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder is promoted.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The sintering promotion effect decreases, and desired hardness and strength cannot be obtained if the amount of Ni contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder is less than 1%, or the sintering promotion effect is saturated if Ni is added such that the amount thereof exceeds 15%. Since Ni is an expensive element, an increase in content of Ni leads to an increase in cost, which is not favorable.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although not particularly limited, the amount of Ni contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder may be 4% to 12% or may be 6% to 11%.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">It becomes difficult to obtain the sintering promotion effect if the amount of Al contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder is less than 1%, or desired strength of the sintered alloy cannot be obtained if the content of Al with respect to the entirety is less than 1.9%. If the content of Al contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder exceeds 12%, the alloy powder becomes hard, and compression moldability deteriorates, which is unfavorable. Although not particularly limited, the amount of Al contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder may be 4% to 12% or may be 6% to 11%. Therefore, it is desirable that the amount of Ni contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder fall within a range of 1% to 15% and that the amount of Al fall within a range of 1% to 12%. Note that it is possible to use Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder obtained by the atomizing method.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, it is also possible to use raw material powder containing 0.1% to 0.9% of P by mass in addition to the composition as the raw material powder.

In a case in which addition is performed in the form of the Cu&#x2014;P and Ni&#x2014;P alloy powder, Cu-8% P is melted and becomes a liquid phase at about 714&#xb0; C., Ni-11% P is melted and becomes a liquid phase at about 880&#xb0; C. during the sintering, and the liquid phases have an action of further enhancing the sintering promotion effect of pure Al that has become a liquid phase earlier. In a case in which P is added, no sintering promotion effect is observed if the amount is less than 0.1%, or the sintering promotion effect is saturated if the amount of added P exceeds 0.9%, which are not favorable.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is also possible to use raw material powder containing 0.02% to 0.2%, or more preferably 0.02% to 0.1% of sintering aid made of at least one of aluminum fluoride and calcium fluoride by mass in addition to the composition as the raw material powder. Aluminum fluoride and calcium fluoride react the Al oxide coating covering the surface of the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al powder, can remove it during the sintering, and can thus enhance the sintering promotion effect. However, the effect of enhancing sintering promotion is not observed if the amount of added aluminum fluoride and calcium fluoride is less than 0.02%. On the other hand, the effect of enhancing sintering promotion is saturated, and there is a concern that an influence of gas generated by fluorides increases if 0.2% or more fluorides are added, which are not favorable, and it is thus preferable not to add the fluorides or to minimize the amount of addition as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present invention, it is also possible to use mixed powder obtained by adding at least one kind or two or more kinds of powders out of Ni&#x2014;P alloy powder, a Cu&#x2014;P alloy powder, aluminum fluoride powder, and calcium fluoride powder in addition to the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al alloy powder and the pure Al powder as the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a case in which Ni powder is added to the raw material powder, it is possible to add Ni powder or Ni-11% P powder to the raw material powder such that the total amount in addition to the amount of Ni contained in the Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al alloy powder is 15% or less.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a case in which a mold lubricant such as zinc stearate powder or ethylene bisamide powder is added to the raw material powder, it is possible to add the metal die lubricant within a range of 1.5% or less to the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Manufacturing Method&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Examples of the method for manufacturing a sintered alloy according to the present embodiment will be described later in detail. As an example of the embodiment of the invention of the present application, mixed powder obtained by mixing a necessary amount of the pure Al powder with Cu&#x2014;Ni&#x2014;Al-based alloy powder as base powder is used as the raw material powder. As the raw material powder, raw material powder to which the aforementioned additives are added may be used.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a case in which the content of Ni in the raw material powder is increased, it is possible to add and mix Ni powder. Similarly, in a case in which C is contained, it is possible to mix natural graphite powder. Similarly, in a case in which P is contained, it is possible to mix Cu&#x2014;P alloy powder or Ni&#x2014;P alloy powder. In a case in which a sintering aid is contained, it is possible to mix aluminum fluoride powder or calcium fluoride powder. In a case in which the amount of added graphite is 4% by mass or less, it is possible to mix a lubricant in the powder form such as zinc stearate or ethylene bisamide.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a case in which the raw material mixed powder is produced, it is preferable to use mixed powder with a particle size (D50) of about 10 to 90 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">After mixing the powder at predetermined proportions to obtain the aforementioned ranges, the powder is sufficiently mixed using a mixing machine such as a V-type mixer, thereby obtaining the raw material powder.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is possible to fill a molding metal die with the raw material powder, to perform compression molding under a predetermined pressure, and thereby to obtain a molded article. Examples of the shape of the molded article include a ring shape.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, the molded article is accommodated in a heating furnace in which an atmosphere can be adjusted and is heated and sintered at a predetermined temperature in a predetermined atmosphere. As the atmosphere during the sintering, it is possible to use a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas that contains 3% by volume or more, for example, 5% to 15% by volume of hydrogen gas. Alternatively, it is possible to use a mixture gas atmosphere of hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas in which the proportion of hydrogen gas is adjusted to 3% by volume or more by diluting decomposed ammonia gas with nitrogen gas. The sintering temperature is 880&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C. and is more preferably 920&#xb0; C. to 970&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">If the temperature is slowly lowered after the sintering, an Ni&#x2014;Al compound phase with high hardness is likely to precipitate, and initial conformability of a sliding member deteriorates. Therefore, it is preferable to raise the cooling speed after the sintering as much as possible. The preferable cooling speed is 10&#xb0; C./minute or more.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">After the cooling, the sintered body is subjected to sizing under a predetermined pressure. In one example of the present embodiment, it is possible to obtain the bearing part <b>1</b> made of a ring-shaped sintered alloy with predetermined outer diameter, inner diameter, and length by causing the sintered body after the cooling to be subjected to the sizing under the predetermined pressure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The bearing part <b>1</b> made of the sintered alloy is a sintered alloy that has porosity of about 10% to 20% and has compressed environment strength that is strength as high as about 90 to 310 N/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Also, the aforementioned sintered alloy is a sintered alloy that contains about 2% to 15% of Al, contains 1% to 15% of Ni, and thus has excellent corrosion resistance, and the bearing part <b>1</b> exhibits excellent corrosion resistance.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Therefore, if the bearing part <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is used as a bearing for a motor fuel pump of an engine, there is an effect that it is possible to provide the bearing part <b>1</b> with excellent corrosion resistance and excellent durability with which it can be used for a long period of time even if it is used in an environment in which a large amount of impurities such as sulfur and organic acids are contained in a liquid fuel such as gasoline or light oil. According to the bearing part <b>1</b> in the present embodiment, it is possible to maintain excellent corrosion resistance through adjustment of the amount of added Al that is reasonable even if the amount of Ni contained in the sintered alloy is reduced to reduce cost.
