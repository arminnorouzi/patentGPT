id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Turbines and associated equipment are normally cleaned via water or chemical pressure washing via a mist, spray systems. However, these systems fail to reach deep across the gas path to remove fouling materials. Various embodiments herein pertain to apparatus and methods that utilize the water and exiting chemicals to generate a foam. The foam can be introduced at that gas-path entrance of the equipment, where it contacts the stages and internal surfaces to contact, scrub, carry, and remove fouling away from equipment to restore performance.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="109.90mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230003139A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded

Energy can range from steam to fuel combustion. Extracted power is then utilized for electricity, propulsion, or general power. Turbines work by turning the flow of fluids and gases into usable energy to power helicopters, airplanes, tanks, power plants, ships, specialty vehicles, cities, etc. Upon use, the gas-path of such devices becomes fouled with debris and contaminants such as minerals, sand, dust, soot, carbon, etc. When fouled, the performance of the equipment deteriorates, requiring maintenance and cleaning.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is well known that turbines come in many forms such as jet engines, industrial turbines, or ground-based and ship-based aero-derived units. The internal surfaces of the equipment, such as that of an airplane or helicopter engine, accumulate fouling material, deteriorating airflow across the engine, and diminishing performance. Correlated to this trend, fuel consumption increases, engine life shortens, and power available decreases. The simplest means and most cost effective means to maintain engine health and restore performance is to properly clean an engine. There are many methods available, such as mist, sprays, and vapor systems. However, all fail to reach deep or across the entire engine gas-path.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Telemetry or diagnostic tools on engine have become routine functions to monitor engine health. Yet, using such tools to monitor, trigger, or quantify improvement from foam engine cleaning have not been utilized in the past.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various embodiments of the present invention provide novel and unobvious methods and apparatus for the cleaning of such power plants.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Foam material is introduced at the gas-path entry of turbine equipment while off-line. The foam will coat and contact the internal surfaces, scrubbing, removing, and carrying fouling material away from equipment.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention pertains to an apparatus for foaming a cleaning agent. Some embodiments include a housing defining an internal flowpath having first, second, and third flow portions, a gas inlet, a liquid inlet for the cleaning agent, and a foam outlet. The first flow portion includes a gas plenum that is adapted and configured for receiving gas under pressure from the gas inlet and including a plurality of apertures, the plenum and the interior of the housing forming a mixing region that provides a first foam of the liquid and the gas. The second flow portion receives the first foam and flows the first foam past a foam growth matrix adapted and configured to provide surface area for attachment and merging of the cells. The third flow portion flows the second foam through a foam structuring member downstream of either the first portion or the second portion adapted and configured to reduce the size of at least some of the cells. It is understood that yet other embodiments of the present invention contemplate a housing having only a first portion; or a first and second portion; or only a first and third portion in various other nucleation devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a method for foaming a liquid cleaning agent. Some embodiments include mixing the liquid cleaning agent and a pressurized gas to form a first foam. Other embodiments include flowing the first foam over a member or matrix and increasing the size of the cells of the first foam to form a second foam. Yet other embodiments include flowing the second foam through a structure such as a mesh or one or more apertured plates and decreasing the size of the cells of the second foam to form a third foam.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another aspect of the present invention pertains to a system for providing an air-foamed liquid cleaning agent. Other embodiments include an air pump or pressurized gas reservoir providing air or gas at pressure higher than ambient pressure, and a liquid pump providing the liquid at pressure. Still other embodiments include a nucleation device receiving pressurized air, a liquid inlet receiving pressurized liquid, and a foam outlet, the nucleation device turbulently mixing the pressurized air and the liquid to create a foam. Yet other embodiments include a nozzle receiving the foam through a foam conduit, the internal passageways of the nozzle and the conduit being adapted and configured to not increase the turbulence of the foam, the nozzle being adapted and configured to deliver a low velocity stream of foam.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another aspect pertains to a method for providing an air-foamed liquid cleaning agent to the inlet of a jet engine installed on an airplane. Some embodiments include providing a source of a pressurized liquid cleaning agent, an air pump, a turbulent mixing chamber, and a non-atomizing supply aperture. Other embodiments include mixing pressurized air with pressurized liquid in the mixing chamber and creating a supply of foam. Still other embodiments include streaming the supply of foam into the installed engine either through the inlet or through various tubing attached to the engine from the aperture.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another aspect of the present invention pertains to an apparatus for foaming a water soluble liquid cleaning agent. Some embodiments include means for mixing a pressurized gas with a flowing water soluble liquid to create a foam. Other embodiments include means for growing the size of the cells of the foam and means for reducing the size of the grown cells.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In various embodiments of the invention, the effluent after a cleaning operation is collected and evaluated. This evaluation can include an on-site analysis of the content of the effluent, including whether or not particular metals or compounds are present in the effluent. Based on the results of this evaluation, a decision is made as to whether or not further cleaning is appropriate.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still further embodiments of the present invention pertain to a method in which the effect of a cleaning operation is assessed, and that assessment is used to evaluate the terms of a contract. As one example, the contract may pertain to the terms of the engine warranty provided by the engine manufacturer to the operator or owner of the aircraft. In still further embodiments the assessment may be used to evaluate the terms of a contract pertaining to the engine cleaning operation itself. In yet further embodiments the assessment of the cleaning effect on the engine may be used to evaluate the engine relative to establish FAA maintenance standards for that engine.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the assessment method includes operating an engine in a commercial flight environment for more than about one month. It is anticipated that in some embodiments this operation can include multiple flights per day, and usage of the aircraft for up to seven days per week. The method further includes operating the used engine and establishing a baseline characteristic. In some embodiments, the baseline characteristic can be specific fuel consumption at a particular level of thrust, exhaust pressure ratio, or rotor speed. In some alternatives, the method includes correcting this baseline data for ambient atmospheric characteristics. In yet other embodiments, the baseline parameter could be the elapsed time for the start of an engine from zero rpm up to idle speed. In still further embodiments, the baseline assessment of the used engine includes the assessment of engine start time in the following manner: performing a first start of an engine; shutting down the engine; motoring the engine on the starter (without the combustion of fuel) for a predetermined period of time; and after the motoring, performing a second engine start, and using the second engine start time as the baseline start time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method further includes cleaning the engine. This cleaning of the engine may include one or more successive cleaning cycles. After the engine is cleaned, the baseline test method is repeated. This second test results (of the cleaned engine) are compared to the baseline test results (of the used engine, as received); and the changes in engine characteristics are assessed against a contractual guarantee. As one example, the operator of the cleaning equipment may have offered contractual terms to the owner or operator of the aircraft with regards to the improvement to be made by the cleaning method. In still further embodiments, the delta improvement provided by the cleaning method (or alternatively, the test results of the cleaned engine considered by itself) can be compared to a contractual guarantee between the manufacturer of the engine (or the facility that performed the previous overhaul of the engine, or the licensee of the engine) to assess whether or not the cleaned engine meets those contractual terms.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still further embodiments, there is a cleaning method in which a baseline test is performed on a used engine; the engine is cleaned; and the baseline test is performed a second time. The comparison of the baseline test to the clean engine test can be used for any reason.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In yet other embodiments, the cleaning method includes a procedure in which the engine is operated in a cleaning cycle, and that cleaning cycle (or a different cleaning cycle), is subsequently applied to the engine. Preferably, the cleaning chemicals are provided to the engine at relatively low rotational speeds, and preferably less than about one-half the typical idle speed for that engine.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In still further embodiments, such as in those engines supported substantially vertically, the cleaning chemical can be applied to the engine when the engine is static (i.e., zero rpm). After applying a sufficient amount of chemicals, the engine can then be rotated at any speed, and the cleaning chemicals subsequently flushed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Yet other embodiments of the present invention pertain to methods for cleaning an engine that include manipulation of the temperature of the cleaning chemicals and/or manipulation of the temperature of the engine that is being cleaned. In one embodiment, the cleaning system includes a heater that is adapted and configured to heat the cleaning chemicals prior to the creation of a cleaning foam. In still further embodiments, the method includes a heater for heating the air being used to create the foam with the cleaning liquids. In still further embodiments, the cleaning apparatus includes one or more air blowers that provide a source of heated ambient air (similar to &#x201c;alligator&#x201d; space heaters used at construction sites). These hot air blowers can be positioned at the inlet of the engine, and the engine can be motored (i.e., rotated on the starter, without combustion of fuel) for either a predetermined period of time (which may be based on ambient conditions), or motored until thermocouples or other temperature measurement devices in the engine hot section have reached a predetermined temperature. In still further embodiments, the temperature of the engine prior to the introduction of the cleaning foam can be raised by starting the engine and operating the engine at idle conditions for a predetermined period of time, and subsequently shut down the engine prior to introduction of the cleaning foam. In still further embodiments, the engine can be motored after the shutdown from idle and before the introduction of chemicals to further achieve a consistent baseline temperature condition prior to introduction of the foam. Still further embodiments of the present invention contemplate any combination of preheated liquid chemicals, preheated compressed air used for foaming, externally heated engines, and engines made &#x201c;warm&#x201d; by one or more recent periods of operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In still further embodiments of the present invention, the cleaning foam can be heated by providing a heating element within the device used to mix and create the cleaning foam.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be appreciated that the various apparatus and methods described in this summary section, as well as elsewhere in this application, can be expressed as a large number of different combinations and subcombinations. All such useful, novel, and inventive combinations and subcombinations are contemplated herein, it being recognized that the explicit expression of each of these combinations is unnecessary.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some of the figures shown herein may include dimensions.

Some users utilize water sprayed into the inlet of the engine, others utilize a cleaning fluid sprayed into the inlet of the engine, and still further users provide solid, abrading material to the inlet of the engine, such as walnut shells.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">These methods achieve varying degrees of success, and further create varying degrees of problems. For example, some cleaning agents that are strong enough to clean the hot section of the engine and are chemically acceptable on hot section materials, are chemically unacceptable on material used in the cold section of the engine. Water washes are mild enough to be used on any materials in the engine, but are also not particularly effective in removing difficult deposits, and still further can leave deposits of silica in some stages of the compressor. A number of water-soluble cleaning agents are recognized in MIL-PRF-85704C, but many users of these cleaning agents consider them to be marginally successful in restoring performance to an engine operating parameter, and still other users have noted that simple washes with these MIL cleaning agents can actually degrade some operational parameters.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Therefore, many operators of aircraft are suspicious of the claims made with regards to some liquid cleaning methods, as to how effective liquids will be in restoring performance to the engine. There are expenses incurred by liquid washing of an engine, including the cost of the liquid wash and the value of the time that the air vehicle is removed from operation. Often, the benefits of the liquid wash do not outweigh the incurred costs, or provide only negligible commercial benefit.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Various embodiments of the present invention indicate a substantial commercial benefit to be gained by washing of gas turbine engines with a foam. As will be shown herein, the foam cleaning of an engine can provide substantial improvements in operating parameters, including improvements not obtainable with liquid washing. The reason for the substantial improvement realized by foam washing is not fully understood. Back-to-back engine tests have been performed on the same specific engine, with the introduction of atomized liquid into the inlet, followed by the introduction of a foam of that same liquid into the inlet. In all cases, the liquid (or the foam) was observed in the engine exhaust section, indicating that the liquid (or the foam) appears to be wetting the entire gaspath. Nonetheless, the use of a foamed version of a liquid provides significant improvements over and above any liquid washing improvements in important operational parameters, such as engine start times, specific fuel consumption, and turbine temperatures required to achieve a particular power output.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Some embodiments of the present invention pertain to a system for generating a foam from a water-soluble cleaning agent. It has been found that there are differences in the apparatus and methods of creating an acceptable foam with a water-soluble chemical, or a non-water-soluble chemical. Various embodiments of the present invention pertain to systems including nucleation chambers provided with pressurized liquid and also pressurized air.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">It has been found that injecting this foam into an engine inlet by way of conditional atomizing nozzles can reduce the cleaning effectiveness of the foam. Still further, any plumbing, tubing, or hoses that deliver foam from the nucleation chamber to the nozzle should be generally smooth, and substantially free of turbulence-generating features in the flowpath (such as sharp turns, sudden reductions in flow area of the foam flowpath, or delivery nozzles having sections with excessive convergence, such as convergence to increase the velocity of the foam).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">It is helpful in various embodiments of the present invention to provide a flowpath for the generated foam that maintains the higher energy state of the foam, and not dissipate that energy prior to delivery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows foam being delivered according to one embodiment of the present invention. It can be seen that nozzle <b>30</b> provides a stream of foam that is of substantially the same diameter. There is little or no convergence apparent in the photo of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, and no divergence of the flow stream. Further, the ripples or &#x201c;lumps&#x201d; in the foam flow stream are indicative of a low velocity delivery system, wherein the disturbance imparted to the foam stream when it impacts the spinner visibly passes upstream toward the nozzle. The amplitude of the &#x201c;lumps&#x201d; in the foam flowpath can be seen to be of highest magnitude near the impact of the foam with the spinner, and of lesser magnitude in a direction toward the exit nozzle <b>30</b>. The foam exiting nozzle <b>30</b> is of a substantially constant diameter, and preferably at a velocity less than about fifteen feet per second.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Various embodiments of the present invention also are assisted by the introduction of gas (including air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or any other gas) in a pressurized state into a flow of the cleaning liquid. Preferably, air is pressurized to more than about 5 psig and less than about 120 psig, and supplied by a pump or pressurized reservoir. Although some embodiments of the present invention do include the use of airflow eductors that can entrain ambient air, yet other embodiments using pressurized air had been found to provide improved results.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Yet other embodiments of the present invention pertain to the commercial use of foam cleaning with aviation engines. As discussed earlier, the mechanism by which a foamed cleaning agent provides results superior to a non-foamed cleaning agent are not currently well understood. To the converse, many experts in the field of jet engine maintenance initially believe that a foamed cleaning agent will provide the same disappointing results as would be provided by a non-foamed cleaning agent. Therefore, as the use of a foam cleaning agent becomes better understood, the effect of the improved foam cleaning on the financial considerations in supporting a family of engines will become better understood. Some of these improvements may be readily apparent, such as the improvements in operating temperature, specific fuel consumption, and start times indicated by the testing documented herein. Yet other impacts from the use of foam cleaning agents may further impact the design of other, life-limited components in the engine.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">For example, engines are currently designed with life-limited parts (such as those based on hours of usage, time at temperature, number of engine cycles, or others), and inspections of those components may be scheduled at times coincident with liquid washing of the engine. However, the use of foam washing may generally increase the time that an engine can be installed on the aircraft, since the foam washing will restore the used engine to a better performance level than liquid washing would. However, an increase in time between foam washings (increased as compared to the interval between liquid washings) could be lengthened to the extent that a foam washing no longer coincides with an inspection of a life-limited part. Under these conditions, it may be financially rewarding to design the life-limited part to a slightly longer cycle. The increase in the cost of the longer-lived life-limited component may be more than offset by the increased time that the foam cleaned engine can remain on the wing.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In such embodiments, there can be a shift in the paradigm of the engine washing, inspection, and maintenance intervals, resulting at least in part by the improved cleaning resulting from foam washing. In some embodiments, the effect of foam washing on an engine performance parameter (such as start time, temperature at max rated power, specific fuel consumption, carbon emission, oxides of nitrogen emission, typical operating speeds of the engine at cruise and take-off, etc.) can be quantified. That quantification can occur within a family of engines, but in some instances may be applicable between different families. As a specific engine within that family is operated on an aircraft, the operator of the aircraft will note some change in an operating parameter that can be correlated with an improvement to be gained by a foam washing of that specific engine. That information taken by the aircraft operator is passed on to the engine owner (which could be the U.S. government, an engine manufacturer, or an engine leasing company), and that owner determines when to schedule a foam cleaning of that specific engine.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">It has been found experimentally that various embodiments of the foam washing methods and apparatus described herein are more effective in removing contaminants from a used engine than by way of spray cleaning of a liquid cleaning agent. In some cases, the effluent collected in the turbine after the foam cleaning has been compared to the effluent collected in the turbine after a liquid wash, with the liquid wash having preceded the foam wash. In these cases, the foam effluent was found to have contained in it substantial amounts of dirt and deposits that were not removed by the liquid wash.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">It is believed that in some families of engines the use of a foam wash will provide an improvement in the cleanliness of the combustor liner. It is well known that combustor liners include complex arrangements of cooling holes, these cooling holes being designed to not just maintain a safe temperature for the liner itself, but further to reduce gas path temperatures and thereby limit the formation of oxides of nitrogen. It is anticipated that various embodiments of the present invention will demonstrate reductions in the emission of a cleaned engine of the oxides of nitrogen.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> present various representations of a washing or cleaning system <b>20</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention.

It can be seen that some embodiments utilize a pair of nozzles that deliver foam to an inlet from substantially the same location and space, except on opposite sides of the engine centerline. Generally, nozzles in some embodiments have non-atomizing nozzles that provide the stream of foam into ambient conditions. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>, the cross sectional area of the nozzle apparatus <b>30</b> generally increases from a unitary central delivery tube, to a pair of side-by-side exit nozzles, each of which substantially the same cross sectional area. Therefore, the cross sectional area as a function of length along the flowpath of apparatus <b>30</b> is relatively constant for the central section, but then increases as the central section splits into two side-by-side nozzles.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>10</b></figref> pertain to various tests performed with different embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provides views of a corrugated-perimeter noise suppression exhaust nozzle <b>16</b>, both after a wash according to existing procedures, and also after a wash performed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

However, a subsequent wash of that same engine with an inventive washing system provided an additional reduction in start time of almost 9 seconds, thus showing that a cleaning method according to one embodiment of the present invention is able to improve the engine gaspath flow dynamics beyond the improvement achieved with a standard wash (such as those methods in which a spray of atomized cleaning fluid is provided into the inlet of an engine).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref> depict testing and test results performed on a helicopter engine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> show the engine <b>10</b> being cleaned with the effluent foam <b>28</b> exiting the dual exhaust nozzles <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the results of multiple start tests performed on a helicopter engine. It can be seen that the start time of a used engine was reduced by about 5 percent using an existing washing technique.

Many of these embodiments include a housing X<b>61</b> that includes an inlet X<b>62</b> for gas, an inlet X<b>63</b> for one or more liquids, and an outlet X<b>64</b> that provides the foam output <b>28</b> to a nozzle X<b>30</b>. In some embodiments, a gas chamber X<b>66</b> receives gas under pressure from inlet X<b>62</b>. Gas chamber X<b>66</b> is preferably enclosed within housing X<b>61</b>, and arranged such that portions of gas chamber X<b>66</b> are in contact with fluid from inlet X<b>63</b> within housing X<b>61</b>. Several embodiments include gas chambers X<b>66</b> that have one or more apertures or other features X<b>70</b> that provide fluid communication from the internal passageway of chamber X<b>66</b> and the fluid within housing X<b>61</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">The introduction of gas through the apertures X<b>70</b> are adapted and configured to create a foam with the cleaning liquid within a nucleation zone X<b>65</b>. Preferably, the foam is created by nucleation of pre-certified aviation chemicals with proper arrangement of high speed air jets, diffuser sections, growth spikes, and/or centrifugal sheering of the chemicals, any of which can be used to create the foam which is a higher energy, short-lived state of the more stable non-foamed liquid chemical. The resultant foam is provided to outlet X<b>64</b> for introduction into the inlet of the device being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">In some embodiments, chamber X<b>60</b> further includes a cell growth section X<b>74</b> in which there is material or an apparatus that encourages merging of smaller foam cells into a larger foam cell. In still other embodiments, nucleation chamber X<b>60</b> can include a cell structuring section X<b>78</b> that includes material or apparatus for improving the homogeneity of the foam material. Still further embodiments of chamber X<b>60</b> include a laminar flow section X<b>82</b> in which the foamed material <b>28</b> is made less turbulent so as to increase the longevity of the foam cells and thus increase the number of foam cells delivered to the inlet <b>11</b> of the product <b>10</b> being cleaned.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">Some of the nucleation chambers X<b>60</b> include nucleation zones, growth sections, and structuring sections that are arranged serially within the foam flowpath. In yet other embodiments these zones and sections are arranged concentrically, with the foam first being created proximate to the centerline of the flowpath. In yet other embodiments the zones and sections are arranged concentrically with the foam being created at the periphery of the flowpath, with the cells being grown and structured progressively toward the center of the flowpath.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">Some of the nucleation chambers X<b>60</b> described herein include nucleation zones, growth sections, and structuring sections that are arranged within a single plenum. However, it is understood that yet other embodiments contemplate a modular arrangement to the nucleation chamber. For example, the nucleation zone can be a separate component that is bolted to a structuring zone, or a to laminar flow zone. For example, the various sections can be attached to one another by flanges and fasteners, threaded fittings, or the like. Still further, the systems X<b>20</b> are described herein to include a single nucleation chamber. However, it understood that the cleaning system can include multiple nucleation chambers. As one example, a plurality of chambers can be fed from manifolds that provide the liquids and gas. This parallel flow arrangement can provide a foam output that likewise is manifolded together to a single nozzle X<b>28</b>, or to a plurality of nozzles arranged in a pattern to best match the engine inlet geometry.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">The various washing systems X<b>20</b> discussed herein can include a mixture of liquids (such as water, chemical A, and chemical B) that are provided to the inlet of the nucleation chamber, within which gas is injected so as to create a foam from the mixture of liquids. However, the present invention is not so limited, and further includes those embodiments in which the liquids may be foamed separately. For example, a cleaning system according to another embodiment of the present invention may include a first nucleation chamber for chemical A, and a second nucleation chamber for a mixture of chemical B and water. The two resultant foams can then be provided to a single nozzle X<b>28</b>, or can be provided to separate nozzles X<b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">The various descriptions that follow pertain to a variety of embodiments of nucleation chambers X<b>60</b> incorporating numerous differences and numerous similarities. It is understood that each of these is presented by way of example only, and are not intended to place boundaries on the broad ideas expressed herein. As yet another example, the present invention contemplates an embodiment in which the liquid product is provided to an inlet X<b>63</b> and flows within a flowpath surrounded by a circumferential gas chamber X<b>66</b>. In such embodiments, gas chamber X<b>66</b> defines an annular flow space and provides gas under pressure from an inlet X<b>62</b> into the liquid product flowing within the annulus.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref> show a nucleation chamber <b>60</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention.

Contained within housing <b>61</b> is a generally cylindrical gas tube <b>66</b> that receives gas under pressure from inlet <b>62</b>. Although gas chamber <b>66</b> has been described as a cylindrical tube, yet other embodiments of the present invention contemplate internal gas chambers of any size and shape adapted and configured to provide a flow of gas into a flow of liquid such that a foam results.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Gas tube <b>66</b> is located generally concentrically within housing <b>61</b> (although a concentric location is not required), such that liquid from inlet <b>63</b> flows generally around the outer surface of tube <b>66</b>.

Material <b>75</b> is adapted and configured to provide structural surface area on which individual foam cells can attach and combine with other foam cells to divide into more foam cells. Material <b>75</b> includes a plurality of features that cause larger, more energized cells to divide into a number of smaller cells. In some embodiments, material <b>75</b> is a mesh preferably formed from a metallic material. Plastic materials can also be substituted, provided that the organic material can withstand exposure to the liquids <b>22</b> used for cleaning.

In some embodiments, the structuring material <b>79</b> includes a mesh formed from a metal, with the cell size of the mesh of section <b>78</b> being smaller than the mesh size of growth section <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">After the merged (more abundant cells) and structured (improved homogeneity) cells exit section <b>78</b>, they enter a portion of flowpath, parts of which can be within housing <b>61</b>, and parts of which can be outside of housing <b>61</b>, in which the flowpath is adapted and configured to provide laminar flow of the foam <b>28</b>. Therefore, the cross sectional area of the laminar flow section <b>82</b> is preferably larger than the representative cross sectional flow areas of nucleation section <b>65</b>, growth section <b>74</b>, or structuring section <b>78</b>. Flow section <b>82</b> encourages laminar flow and also discourages turbulence that could otherwise reduce the quantity or quality of the foam.

As one example, the centerline of these jets <b>370</b><i>a </i>are about 30-40 degrees from a line extending normal to the centerline of the foam flowpath within chamber <b>360</b> (i.e., forming an angle 60-50 degrees with the centerline). Therefore, air exiting the perforations <b>370</b><i>a </i>within zone <b>372</b><i>a </i>imparts energy to the flow of the surrounding liquid that acts to slow the liquid (i.e., a velocity vector for gas exiting a nozzle <b>370</b><i>a </i>has a component that is opposite to the velocity vector of the liquid flowing from left to right within <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref> of chamber <b>360</b>).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">The nucleation jets <b>370</b> within zone <b>372</b><i>b </i>are angled so as to impart a rotational swirl to the fluid within the foam flowpath.

Engine <b>10</b> typically includes a cold section including an inlet <b>11</b>, a fan <b>12</b> (not shown) and one or more compressors <b>13</b>. Compressed air is provided to the hot section of engine <b>10</b>, including the combustor <b>14</b>, one or more turbines <b>15</b>, and an exhaust system <b>16</b>. Because different engines exhibit variations in wear and tear due to fouling engine <b>10</b> manufacturers have dedicated tubing <b>42</b>, connections, or passages designed for water wash procedures. Because the present invention shows that the cleaning system by foam has improvements, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, and <b>22</b>C</figref>, nozzle <b>30</b> or hose <b>33</b> can also connect directly to one or many of the (dotted line) foam connection <b>41</b> points, targeting specific, some or all engine sections.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">As one example, some compressor sections are known to include one or more manifolds or pipes that carry compressed air, such as for providing bleed air to the aircraft or providing relatively cool compressed air for cooling of the engine hot section. In some embodiments, cleaning foam is provided to the engine through these manifolds or pipes. This foam can be provided while the engine is being rotated, or while the engine is static. Further, engine hot sections are known to include pipes or manifolds that receive cooler, compressed air for purposes of cooling the hot section, and blanked-off ports used for boroscope inspections or other purposes. Yet other embodiments of the present invention contemplate the introduction of foam into such pipes and ports, either in a static engine or a rotating engine.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> is a schematic representation of an engine cutaway with internal and external components illustrating a foam connection-system according to one embodiment of the present invention. In similar fashion to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, the engine <b>10</b> cutaway has an inlet <b>11</b>, a fan <b>12</b>, a compressor <b>13</b> section, a combustor <b>14</b> section, a turbine <b>15</b> section, and an exhaust <b>16</b> section. Tubing <b>43</b>, passages, connections, whether existing or in future engine manufacturing engineering changes, can be used to deliver foam for cleaning engine <b>10</b> sections. In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, because Ihose <b>33</b> is meant to connect to nozzle <b>30</b>, alternatively hose <b>33</b> can directly connect to engine <b>10</b> to one or iterations of connections <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> is a graphical representation of an engine cleaning rotational-cycle prescription in accordance with one embodiment/method of the present invention. As demonstrated in most prior figures, engines <b>10</b> can be mounted in many forms (i.e. horizontal, vertical) and engines come in many shapes and sizes. With this in mind, the foam cleaning procedure can work more effectively at prescribed engine <b>10</b> core speeds (the compressor <b>13</b> sections, and the turbine <b>15</b> sections). By way of example, this graphical representation has three types of core speeds (three individual&#x2014;compressor <b>13</b> to turbine <b>15</b> linked via shaft) shown as N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, and N<b>3</b>. The y-axis is the rotational speed of max allowed (actual values not shown, scale by way of example). The x-axis is the time (not to scale, example only). The purpose of the engine cleaning prescription is to rotate and agitate the foam that flooded the gas-path inside engine <b>10</b>. Foam will contact, scrub and remove fouling. Foam has different fluid dynamic properties at the different rotational (agitation) speeds. Thus, by cycling engine <b>10</b> in various ranging speeds, cleaning efficacy can be attained. The chart shows that the engine <b>10</b> is cranked 3 times (3 cycles) but not limited to this frequency. By evaluating the first cycle, it is evident that N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, and N<b>3</b> behave in accordance with the amount of inertia. At time zero, N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, N<b>3</b> is zero, when engine is cranked for 1 unit, N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, N<b>3</b> reaches a ceiling of about 10.5%, 8.5%, 5.8% respectively. The flooded foam product inside the engine <b>10</b>, forces N<b>3</b> to stop quicker by way of hydrodynamic friction, while comparatively, N<b>1</b> can sustain longer rotation. It is preferred to cycle one or many times in prescription, but engine <b>10</b> can also be cleaned without rotation by injecting and flooding the gas path as discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. Temperature of foam is useful to the frequency and amplitude of the cycling prescription. Vehicle <b>21</b> can house a heater <b>38</b> to regulate and positively impact effectiveness of cleaning prescription.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is a graphical representation of one method of the present invention; for engine monitoring and quantifying benefits. The positive effects and benefits of properly cleaning an engine <b>10</b> can further be quantified into the invention. By use of diagnostic or telemetry tools to obtain financial, operational, maintenance, environmental (i.e. carbon credits, time on wing, fuel savings, etc.). Data analysis tools are scientific methods for enhancing engine <b>10</b> life and safety. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, one embodiment of the present invention includes a method. For example, an engine <b>10</b> in an aircraft or boat transmits information to a data center. Next, the engine operator or manufacturer by way of computer automation, separately or in conjunction with a professional trained person request a foam engine cleaning method. Upon fulfilling a foam cleaning method in conjunction with this monitoring method, performance restoration metrics can log improvements. These quantified improvements can be collected for financial goals, carbon credits, engine life extension, and/or safety.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> show various embodiments of a portable effluent collector according to one embodiment of the present invention.

Each of the support ribs are located on opposite sides of the trailer, and each of them are pivotally coupled to the forward end of trailer <b>232</b>.<b>1</b>. Preferably, the sheet is sufficiently large, and also loosely draped on the ribs, such that in the vertically-supported condition the sheet forms an enclosure <b>32</b>.<b>31</b> having an inlet <b>232</b>.<b>34</b> for collection of foam coming out of the exhaust of the engine. The enclosure <b>232</b>.<b>31</b> forms a gravity-assisted flowpath from the inlet to a drain that is located proximate to the pool <b>232</b>.<b>2</b>. Any foam received in the inlet flows downward within the enclosure and into the pool by way of the drain. A pair of vertical supports <b>232</b>.<b>33</b> are provided on either side of the enclosure. Each of the vertical supports couples at one end to a side of the trailer, and at the other end to a corresponding rib. The rib and the corresponding vertical supports are locked together in the extended condition (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>), to maintain the enclosure in an upright state.
