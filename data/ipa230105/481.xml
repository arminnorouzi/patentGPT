However the damage is incurred, a subject who suffers such an injury may be limited, perhaps significantly, from engaging in employment functions, sporting activities, physical exercise, and/or some social engagements, etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Subjects with such injuries typically may seek surgical intervention to repair such damage. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), Achilles tendon, meniscus, among other soft tissue, tendons, and/or ligaments may, or might not, naturally heal properly and/or fully. For example, naturally forming clots/scaffolds might not develop in a timely or structurally adequate fashion, if such clots/scaffolds develop at all.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tissues found outside of joints heal by forming a fibrin clot, which connects the ruptured tissue ends and is subsequently remodeled to form scar, which heals the tissue. Inside a synovial joint, a fibrin clot either fails to form or is quickly lysed after injury to the knee, thus preventing joint arthrosis and stiffness after minor injury. Joints contain synovial fluid which, as part of normal joint activity, naturally prevent clot formation in joints. This fibrinolytic process results in premature loss of the fibrin clot scaffold and disruption of the healing process for tissues within the joint or within intra-articular tissues. Surgical treatments to repair such injuries/damages may include removing the damaged tissue and replacing the removed tissue with a point-to-point tissue graft.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Technologies are disclosed for an implant device that may be configured to repair tissue.
