Some example alternatives have included devices wherein a solid or liquid fuel is combusted to transfer heat to tobacco or wherein a chemical reaction is used to provide such heat source. Additional example alternatives use electrical energy to heat tobacco and/or other aerosol generating substrate materials, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,078,473 to Worm et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. Generally, a device using electrical energy to heat tobacco or other substances may be referred to as an electronic nicotine delivery systems (&#x201c;ENDS&#x201d;) device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many of those devices purportedly have been designed to provide the sensations associated with cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking, but without delivering considerable quantities of incomplete combustion and pyrolysis products that result from the burning of tobacco. To this end, there have been proposed numerous alternative smoking products, flavor generators, and medicinal inhalers that utilize electrical energy to vaporize or heat a volatile material, or attempt to provide the sensations of cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking without burning tobacco to a significant degree. See, for example, the various alternative smoking articles, aerosol delivery devices and heat generating sources set forth in the background art described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,881,737 to Collett et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2013/0255702 to Griffith Jr. et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2014/0000638 to Sebastian et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub.

These example implementations are described so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the implementations set forth herein; rather, these implementations are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the&#x201d; and the like include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Also, while reference may be made herein to quantitative measures, values, geometric relationships or the like, unless otherwise stated, any one or more if not all of these may be absolute or approximate to account for acceptable variations that may occur, such as those due to engineering tolerances or the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described hereinafter, the present disclosure relates to a connector for an aerosol delivery device, such as an electronic nicotine delivery systems (&#x201c;ENDS&#x201d;) device. ENDS is one example of such a device or product that may utilize the multiple point connector embodiments described below. Other examples include delivery devices for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), botanicals, medicinals, and/or other active ingredients. Thus, it will be appreciated that while an ENDS device, such as an aerosol delivery device, is used as an example application of various embodiments throughout, this example is intended to be non-limiting such that inventive concepts disclosed herein can be used with a variety of products or devices other than ENDS devices, including aerosol delivery devices that may be used to deliver other medicinal and/or active ingredients to a user or may include smokeless tobacco or other tobacco products. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate examples of some devices that may include connectors of various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, either end of the connector may include continuous conductive components for multiple points of contact between the cartridge (male end) and battery (female end). These continuous contact points can replace a pin that would be a single point of contact and be subject to potential connection disruptions. In one embodiment, the continuous conductive components are a metal belt or plate. In some embodiments, the continuous conductive components are disposed in the male end of the connection (e.g. the cartridge in one embodiment) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the continuous conductive components may be part of different connections (e.g. PUB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) or in different ends.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Aerosol delivery devices are one example of a product or device that utilizes the connector described herein. Other devices or products may use the connector. As one example, various aerosol delivery devices are further described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. They may be configured to produce an aerosol (an inhalable substance) from an aerosol precursor composition (sometimes referred to as an inhalable substance medium). The aerosol precursor composition may comprise one or more of a solid tobacco material, a semi-solid tobacco material, a liquid aerosol precursor composition, or a gel aerosol precursor composition. In some implementations, the aerosol delivery devices may be configured to heat and produce an aerosol from a fluid aerosol precursor composition (e.g., a liquid aerosol precursor composition). Additionally or alternatively, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise one or more substances mentioned above, including but not limited to botanical substances, medicinal substances, alcohol, glycerin, and may include nicotine, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), or other active ingredients. Such aerosol delivery devices may include so-called electronic cigarettes. In other implementations, the aerosol delivery devices may comprise heat-not-burn devices. In yet other implementations, the aerosol delivery devices may comprise no-heat-no-burn devices.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Liquid aerosol precursor composition, also referred to as a vapor precursor composition or &#x201c;e-liquid,&#x201d; is particularly useful for electronic cigarettes and no-heat-no-burn devices. Liquid aerosol precursor composition may comprise a variety of components including, by way of example, a polyhydric alcohol (e.g., glycerin, propylene glycol, or a mixture thereof), nicotine, tobacco, tobacco extract, and/or flavorants. In some examples, the aerosol precursor composition comprises glycerin and nicotine. In other examples, the composition may additionally or alternatively include alcohol, other botanical substances, other medicinal substances, or may include Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), or other active ingredients, or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some liquid aerosol precursor compositions that may be used in conjunction with various implementations may include one or more acids such as levulinic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, combinations thereof, and the like. Inclusion of an acid(s) in liquid aerosol precursor compositions including nicotine may provide a protonated liquid aerosol precursor composition, including nicotine in salt form. Representative types of liquid aerosol precursor components and formulations are set forth and characterized in U.S. Pat. No. 7,726,320 to Robinson et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 9,254,002 to Chong et al.; and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 2013/0008457 to Zheng et al., 2015/0020823 to Lipowicz et al., and 2015/0020830 to Koller; as well as PCT Pat. App. Pub.

In some implementations, the aerosol precursor composition may incorporate nicotine, which may be present in various concentrations. The source of nicotine may vary, and the nicotine incorporated in the aerosol precursor composition may derive from a single source or a combination of two or more sources. For example, in some implementations the aerosol precursor composition may include nicotine derived from tobacco. In other implementations, the aerosol precursor composition may include nicotine derived from other organic plant sources, such as, for example, non-tobacco plant sources including plants in the Solanaceae family. In other implementations, the aerosol precursor composition may include synthetic nicotine. In some implementations, nicotine incorporated in the aerosol precursor composition may be derived from non-tobacco plant sources, such as other members of the Solanaceae family. The aerosol precursor composition may additionally, or alternatively, include other active ingredients including, but not limited to, botanical ingredients (e.g., lavender, peppermint, chamomile, basil, rosemary, thyme, <i>eucalyptus</i>, ginger, <i>cannabis, ginseng</i>, maca, and tisanes), stimulants (e.g., caffeine and guarana), amino acids (e.g., taurine, theanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) and/or pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and medicinal ingredients (e.g., vitamins, such as B6, B12, and C and cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)).

In some embodiments, the flavor comprises flavor components of cucumber, blueberry, citrus fruits and/or redberry. In some embodiments, the flavor comprises eugenol. In some embodiments, the flavor comprises flavor components extracted from tobacco. In some embodiments, the flavor comprises flavor components extracted from <i>cannabis. </i></p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, the flavor may comprise a sensate, which is intended to achieve a somatosensorial sensation, which are usually chemically induced and perceived by the stimulation of the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve), in addition to or in place of aroma or taste nerves, and these may include agents providing heating, cooling, tingling, numbing effect. A suitable heat effect agent may be, but is not limited to, vanillyl ethyl ether and a suitable cooling agent may be, but not limited to, eucolyptol or WS-3.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Flavoring agents may also include acidic or basic characteristics (e.g., organic acids, such as levulinic acid, succinic acid, pyruvic acid, and benzoic acid). In some implementations, flavoring agents may be combinable with the elements of the substrate material if desired. Example plant-derived compositions that may be suitable are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,107,453 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2012/0152265 both to Dube et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Any of the materials, such as flavorings, casings, and the like that may be useful in combination with a tobacco material to affect sensory properties thereof, including organoleptic properties, such as described herein, may be combined with the substrate material. Organic acids particularly may be able to be incorporated into the substrate material to affect the flavor, sensation, or organoleptic properties of medicaments, such as nicotine, that may be able to be combined with the substrate material. For example, organic acids, such as levulinic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and benzoic acid may be included in the substrate material with nicotine in amounts up to being equimolar (based on total organic acid content) with the nicotine. Any combination of organic acids may be suitable.

No. 8,910,640 to Sears et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In other implementations, the aerosol delivery devices may comprise heat-not-burn devices, configured to heat a solid aerosol precursor composition (e.g., an extruded tobacco rod) or a semi-solid aerosol precursor composition (e.g., a glycerin-loaded tobacco paste). The aerosol precursor composition may comprise tobacco-containing beads, tobacco shreds, tobacco strips, reconstituted tobacco material, or combinations thereof, and/or a mix of finely ground tobacco, tobacco extract, spray dried tobacco extract, or other tobacco form mixed with optional inorganic materials (such as calcium carbonate), optional flavors, and aerosol forming materials to form a substantially solid or moldable (e.g., extrudable) substrate. Representative types of solid and semi-solid aerosol precursor compositions and formulations are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,424,538 to Thomas et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 8,464,726 to Sebastian et al.; U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2015/0083150 to Conner et al.; U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2015/0157052 to Ademe et al.; and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2017/0000188 to Nordskog et al., all of which are incorporated by reference herein. Further representative types of solid and semi-solid aerosol precursor compositions and arrangements include those found in the NEOSTIKS&#x2122; consumable aerosol source members for the GLO&#x2122; product by British American Tobacco and in the HEETS&#x2122; consumable aerosol source members for the IQOS&#x2122; product by Philip Morris International, Inc.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the heating of an inhalable substance includes electronic smoking articles that vaporize a liquid, electronic smoking articles that use a heating element that heats a porous substrate tobacco, electronic smoking articles that utilize precursor constituents in tobacco substrates, electronic smoking articles that make use of a precursor that is heated to form an aerosol that then passes through a porous tobacco substrate, medical devices that may heat a medicament&#x2014;the medicament may be heated through use of any of the device arrangements described herein&#x2014;in liquid and/or solid form so as to form an aerosol, and any combination thereof. In arrangements that utilize a porous substrate tobacco, the porous tobacco substrate may include packed beds of particles of wide variety of geometries, such as may be formed from ground, milled, or powdered tobacco lamina; tobacco monoliths containing air passageways; stacked (or bunched) layers of tobacco sheets; and/or other forms of tobacco and/or reconstituted tobacco. Example arrangements using tobacco substrate heated by aerosolized liquid to which various embodiments may be applied include the background art cited in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2015/0335070 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2017/0065000, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some arrangements that utilize a precursor, the porous tobacco substrate is heated by the passing aerosol, but is not directly heated by a heating element. The precursor may or may not include nicotine and/or other tobacco derivatives. Additionally, any of the described electronic smoking articles may be configured in a &#x201c;dual heating&#x201d; arrangement. In those arrangements, the electronic smoking article includes a vapor precursor (e.g., liquid) that is heated by a first heating element and a porous tobacco substrate downstream of the precursor that is heated by a second heating element. As will be appreciated, the heated vapor passes through/over the heated porous tobacco substrate. Consequently, the porous tobacco substrate (e.g., shreds, spheres, granules, etc.) is heated by the second heating element and by the vapor passing through/over it. Additionally, aerosol precursor may be implemented in either or both of the packed bed of tobacco chamber and the atomizing chamber. Further, the above described electronic smoking articles may be configured to have dual- and/or multi-heating elements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various implementations, the inhalable substance specifically may be a tobacco component or a tobacco-derived material (i.e., a material that is found naturally in tobacco that may be isolated directly from the tobacco or synthetically prepared). For example, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise tobacco extracts or fractions thereof combined with an inert substrate. The aerosol precursor composition may further comprise unburned tobacco or a composition containing unburned tobacco that, when heated to a temperature below its combustion temperature, releases an inhalable substance. In some implementations, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise tobacco condensates or fractions thereof (i.e., condensed components of the smoke produced by the combustion of tobacco, leaving flavors and, possibly, nicotine).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Tobacco materials useful in the present disclosure can vary and may include, for example, flue-cured tobacco, burley tobacco, Oriental tobacco or Maryland tobacco, dark tobacco, dark-fired tobacco and <i>Rustica </i>tobaccos, as well as other rare or specialty tobaccos, or blends thereof. Tobacco materials also can include so-called &#x201c;blended&#x201d; forms and processed forms, such as processed tobacco stems (e.g., cut-rolled or cut-puffed stems), volume expanded tobacco (e.g., puffed tobacco, such as dry ice expanded tobacco (DIET), preferably in cut filler form), reconstituted tobaccos (e.g., reconstituted tobaccos manufactured using paper-making type or cast sheet type processes). Various representative tobacco types, processed types of tobaccos, and types of tobacco blends are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,224 to Lawson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,924,888 to Perfetti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,537 to Brown et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,942 to Brinkley et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,930 to Gentry, U.S. Pat.

No. 7,726,320 to Robinson et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still further, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise an inert substrate having the inhalable substance, or a precursor thereof, integrated therein or otherwise deposited thereon. For example, a liquid comprising the inhalable substance may be coated on or absorbed or adsorbed into the inert substrate such that, upon application of heat, the inhalable substance is released in a form that can be withdrawn from the inventive article through application of positive or negative pressure. In some aspects, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise a blend of flavorful and aromatic tobaccos in cut filler form. In another aspect, the aerosol precursor composition may comprise a reconstituted tobacco material, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,807,809 to Pryor et al.; U.S. Pat.

In the case of an electronic cigarette or a heat-not-burn device, for example, the aerosol production component may be or include a heating element. In other cases, devices may use aerosol production components that generate an aerosol through primarily mechanical components, such as a vibratable piezoelectric component, piezomagnetic mesh, and/or other mechanical aerosol production components.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">One example of a suitable heating element is an induction heater. Such heaters often comprise an induction transmitter and an induction receiver. The induction transmitter may include a coil configured to create an oscillating magnetic field (e.g., a magnetic field that varies periodically with time) when alternating current is directed through it. The induction receiver may be at least partially located or received within the induction transmitter and may include a conductive material (e.g., ferromagnetic material or an aluminum coated material). By directing alternating current through the induction transmitter, eddy currents may be generated in the induction receiver via induction. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material defining the induction receiver may heat it by Joule heating (i.e., through the Joule effect). The induction receiver, which may define an atomizer, may be wirelessly heated to form an aerosol from an aerosol precursor composition positioned in proximity to the induction receiver. Various implementations of an aerosol delivery device with an induction heater are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2017/0127722 to Davis et al.; U.S. Pat. App. Pub.

These heaters may be configured to produce heat when an electrical current is directed through it. In various implementations, a conductive heater may be provided in a variety forms, such as in the form of a foil, a foam, discs, spirals, fibers, wires, films, yarns, strips, ribbons or cylinders. Such heaters often include a metal material and are configured to produce heat as a result of the electrical resistance associated with passing an electrical current through it. Such resistive heaters may be positioned in proximity to and heat an aerosol precursor composition to produce an aerosol. A variety of conductive substrates that may be usable with the present disclosure are described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2013/0255702 to Griffith et al.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations aerosol delivery devices may include a control body and a cartridge in the case of so-called electronic cigarettes or no-heat-no-burn devices, or a control body and an aerosol source member in the case of heat-not-burn devices. In the case of either electronic cigarettes or heat-not-burn devices, the control body may be reusable, whereas the cartridge/aerosol source member may be configured for a limited number of uses and/or configured to be disposable. Various mechanisms may connect the cartridge/aerosol source member to the control body to result in a threaded engagement, a press-fit engagement, an interference fit, a sliding fit, a magnetic engagement, or the like.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The control body and cartridge/aerosol source member may include separate, respective housings or outer bodies, which may be formed of any of a number of different materials. The housing may be formed of any suitable, structurally-sound material. In some examples, the housing may be formed of a metal or alloy, such as stainless steel, aluminum or the like. Other suitable materials include various plastics (e.g., polycarbonate), metal-plating over plastic, ceramics and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cartridge/aerosol source member may include the aerosol precursor composition. In order to produce aerosol from the aerosol precursor composition, the aerosol production component (e.g., heating element, piezoelectric/piezomagnetic mesh) may be positioned in contact with or proximate the aerosol precursor composition, such as across the control body and cartridge through the connector described herein, or in the control body in which the aerosol source member may be positioned. The control body may include a power source, which may be rechargeable or replaceable, and thereby the control body may be reused with multiple cartridges/aerosol source members. The control body may also include means to activate the aerosol delivery device such as a pushbutton, touch-sensitive surface or the like for manual control of the device. Additionally or alternatively, the control body may include a flow sensor to detect when a user draws on the cartridge/aerosol source member to thereby activate the aerosol delivery device.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In various implementations, the aerosol delivery device according to the present disclosure may have a variety of overall shapes, including, but not limited to an overall shape that may be defined as being substantially rod-like or substantially tubular shaped or substantially cylindrically shaped. In the implementations shown in and described with reference to the accompanying figures, the aerosol delivery device has a substantially round cross-section; however, other cross-sectional shapes (e.g., oval, square, rectangle, triangle, etc.) also are encompassed by the present disclosure. The connector described herein may be subject to those different cross-sectional shapes. Such language that is descriptive of the physical shape of the article may also be applied to the individual components thereof, including the control body and the cartridge/aerosol source member. In other implementations, the control body may take another handheld shape, such as a small box shape.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In more specific implementations, one or both of the control body and the cartridge/aerosol source member may be referred to as being disposable or as being reusable. For example, the control body may have a power source such as a replaceable battery or a rechargeable battery, SSB, thin-film SSB, rechargeable supercapacitor, lithium-ion or hybrid lithium-ion supercapacitor, or the like, any of which may be coupled with the connector described herein. One example of a power source is a TKI-1550 rechargeable lithium-ion battery produced by Tadiran Batteries GmbH of Germany. In another implementation, a useful power source may be a N50-AAA CADNICA nickel-cadmium cell produced by Sanyo Electric Company, Ltd., of Japan. In other implementations, a plurality of such batteries, for example providing 1.2-volts each, may be connected in series. The connections may be through the connector described herein. In some implementations, the power source is configured to provide an output voltage. The power source can power the aerosol production component that is powerable to produce an aerosol from an aerosol precursor composition. The power source may be connected with any type of recharging technology, such as a charging accessory.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Examples of power sources are described in U.S. Pat.

The connector described herein may be used for connecting the control body and the cartridge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate an aerosol delivery device <b>100</b> according to an example implementation of the present disclosure. As indicated, the aerosol delivery device may include a control body <b>102</b> and a cartridge <b>104</b>. The control body and the cartridge can be permanently or detachably aligned in a functioning relationship. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the aerosol delivery device in a coupled configuration, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a partially cut-away side view of the aerosol delivery device in a decoupled configuration. The aerosol delivery device may, for example, be substantially rod-like, substantially tubular shaped, or substantially cylindrically shaped in some implementations when the control body and the cartridge are in an assembled configuration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control body <b>102</b> and the cartridge <b>104</b> can be configured to engage one another by a variety of connections, such as a press fit (or interference fit) connection, a threaded connection, a magnetic connection, or the like. The control body may include multiple connections that can engage with the cartridge. The connections may be through the connector described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. For example, the control body may include a first engaging element (e.g., a coupler) that is adapted to engage a second engaging element (e.g., a connector) on the cartridge. The first engaging element and the second engaging element may be reversible. As an example, either of the first engaging element or the second engaging element may be a male thread, and the other may be a female thread. As a further example, either the first engaging element or the second engaging element may be a magnet, and the other may be a metal or a matching magnet. In particular implementations, engaging elements may be defined directly by existing components of the control body and the cartridge. For example, the housing of the control body may define a cavity at an end thereof that is configured to receive at least a portion of the cartridge (e.g., a storage tank or other shell-forming element of the cartridge). In particular, a storage tank of the cartridge may be at least partially received within the cavity of the control body while a mouthpiece of the cartridge remains exposed outside of the cavity of the control body. In some implementations, however, the entire cartridge may be received within the cavity of the control body. The cartridge may be retained within the cavity formed by the control body housing, such as by an interference fit (e.g., through use of detents and/or other features creating an interference engagement between an outer surface of the cartridge and an interior surface of a wall forming the control body cavity), by a magnetic engagement (e.g., though use of magnets and/or magnetic metals positioned within the cavity of the control body and positioned on the cartridge), or by other suitable techniques.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As seen in the cut-away view illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the control body <b>102</b> and cartridge <b>104</b> each include a number of respective components. The components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are representative of the components that may be present in a control body and cartridge and are not intended to limit the scope of components that are encompassed by the present disclosure. As shown, for example, the control body can be formed of a housing <b>206</b> (sometimes referred to as a control body shell) that can include a control component <b>208</b> (e.g., processing circuitry, etc.), a flow sensor <b>210</b>, a power source <b>212</b> (e.g., battery, supercapacitor), and an indicator <b>214</b> (e.g., LED, quantum dot-based LED), and such components can be variably aligned. The power source may be rechargeable, and the control component may include a switch and processing circuitry coupled to the flow sensor and the switch.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The cartridge <b>104</b> can be formed of a housing <b>216</b> (sometimes referred to as the cartridge shell) enclosing a reservoir <b>218</b> configured to retain the aerosol precursor composition, and including a heating element <b>220</b> (aerosol production component). In various configurations, this structure may be referred to as a tank; and accordingly, the terms &#x201c;cartridge,&#x201d; &#x201c;tank&#x201d; and the like may be used interchangeably to refer to a shell or other housing enclosing a reservoir for aerosol precursor composition, and including a heating element.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown, in some examples, the reservoir <b>218</b> may be in fluid communication with a liquid transport element <b>222</b> adapted to wick or otherwise transport an aerosol precursor composition stored in the reservoir housing to the heating element <b>220</b>. In some examples, a valve may be positioned between the reservoir and heating element, and configured to control an amount of aerosol precursor composition passed or delivered from the reservoir to the heating element.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Various examples of materials configured to produce heat when electrical current is applied therethrough may be employed to form the heating element <b>220</b>. Although described as a heating element <b>220</b>, the heating element <b>220</b> may include other structures or components for generating an aerosol in addition to heating an aerosol precursor composition. For example, aerosol delivery devices may include an aerosol production component configured to produce an aerosol from the aerosol precursor composition. In the case of an electronic cigarette or a heat-not-burn device, for example, the aerosol production component may be or include the heating element <b>220</b>. In other cases, devices may use aerosol production components that generate an aerosol through primarily mechanical components, such as a vibratable piezoelectric component, piezomagnetic mesh, and/or other mechanical aerosol production components. In some arrangements that utilize a precursor, the porous tobacco substrate is heated by the passing aerosol, but is not directly heated by the heating element <b>220</b>. The heating element <b>220</b> may be configured in a &#x201c;dual heating&#x201d; arrangement. In those arrangements, the electronic smoking article includes a vapor precursor (e.g., liquid) that is heated by a first heating element and a porous tobacco substrate downstream of the precursor that is heated by a second heating element. As will be appreciated, the heated vapor passes through/over the heated porous tobacco substrate.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The heating element <b>220</b> in the heating example may be a resistive heating element such as a wire coil, micro heater or the like. Example materials from which the heating element may be formed include Kanthal (FeCrAl), nichrome, nickel, stainless steel, indium tin oxide, tungsten, molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2), molybdenum silicide (MoSi), molybdenum disilicide doped with aluminum (Mo(Si,Al)2), titanium, platinum, silver, palladium, alloys of silver and palladium, graphite and graphite-based materials (e.g., carbon-based foams and yarns), conductive inks, boron doped silica, and ceramics (e.g., positive or negative temperature coefficient ceramics). The heating element may be resistive heating element or a heating element configured to generate heat through induction. The heating element may be coated by heat conductive ceramics such as aluminum nitride, silicon carbide, beryllium oxide, alumina, silicon nitride, or their composites. Example implementations of heating elements useful in aerosol delivery devices according to the present disclosure are further described below, and can be incorporated into devices such as those described herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">An opening <b>224</b> may be present in the housing <b>216</b> (e.g., at the mouth end) to allow for egress of formed aerosol from the cartridge <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The cartridge <b>104</b> also may include one or more electronic components <b>226</b>, which may include an integrated circuit, a memory component (e.g., EEPROM, flash memory), a sensor, or the like. The electronic components may be adapted to communicate with the control component <b>208</b> and/or with an external device by wired or wireless means. The electronic components may be positioned anywhere within the cartridge or a base <b>228</b> thereof.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although the control component <b>208</b> and the flow sensor <b>210</b> are illustrated separately, it is understood that various electronic components including the control component and the flow sensor may be combined on a circuit board (e.g., PCB) that supports and electrically connects the electronic components. Further, the circuit board may be positioned horizontally relative the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in that the circuit board can be lengthwise parallel to the central axis of the control body. In some examples, the air flow sensor may comprise its own circuit board or other base element to which it can be attached. In some examples, a flexible circuit board may be utilized. A flexible circuit board may be configured into a variety of shapes, include substantially tubular shapes. In some examples, a flexible circuit board may be combined with, layered onto, or form part or all of a heater substrate.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The control body <b>102</b> and the cartridge <b>104</b> may include components adapted to facilitate a fluid engagement therebetween. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the control body can include a coupler <b>230</b> having a cavity <b>232</b> therein. The base <b>228</b> of the cartridge can be adapted to engage the coupler and can include a projection <b>234</b> adapted to fit within the cavity. Such engagement can facilitate a stable connection between the control body and the cartridge as well as establish an electrical connection between the power source <b>212</b> and control component <b>208</b> in the control body and the heating element <b>220</b> in the cartridge. Further, the housing <b>206</b> can include an air intake <b>236</b>, which may be a notch in the housing where it connects to the coupler that allows for passage of ambient air around the coupler and into the housing where it then passes through the cavity <b>232</b> of the coupler and into the cartridge through the projection <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, the connection between the coupler and the base may be with the connector described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref> that includes pins with multiple contact points. In some embodiments, the coupler and the base useful according to the present disclosure are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2014/0261495 to Novak et al., which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the coupler <b>230</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may define an outer periphery <b>238</b> configured to mate with an inner periphery <b>240</b> of the base <b>228</b>. In one example the inner periphery of the base may define a radius that is substantially equal to, or slightly greater than, a radius of the outer periphery of the coupler. Further, the coupler may define one or more protrusions <b>242</b> at the outer periphery configured to engage one or more recesses <b>244</b> defined at the inner periphery of the base. However, various other examples of structures, shapes and components may be employed to couple the base to the coupler. In some examples the connection between the base of the cartridge <b>104</b> and the coupler of the control body <b>102</b> may be substantially permanent, whereas in other examples the connection therebetween may be releasable such that, for example, the control body may be reused with one or more additional cartridges that may be disposable and/or refillable.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The reservoir <b>218</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> can be a container or can be a fibrous reservoir, as presently described. For example, the reservoir can comprise one or more layers of nonwoven fibers substantially formed into the shape of a tube encircling the interior of the housing <b>216</b>, in this example. An aerosol precursor composition can be retained in the reservoir. Liquid components, for example, can be sorptively retained by the reservoir. The reservoir can be in fluid connection with the liquid transport element <b>222</b>. The liquid transport element can transport the aerosol precursor composition stored in the reservoir via capillary action&#x2014;or via a micro pump&#x2014;to the heating element <b>220</b> that is in the form of a metal wire coil in this example. As such, the heating element is in a heating arrangement with the liquid transport element.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, a microfluidic chip may be embedded in the reservoir <b>218</b>, and the amount and/or mass of aerosol precursor composition delivered from the reservoir may be controlled by a micro pump, such as one based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. Other example implementations of reservoirs and transport elements useful in aerosol delivery devices according to the present disclosure are further described herein, and such reservoirs and/or transport elements can be incorporated into devices such as those described herein. In particular, specific combinations of heating members and transport elements as further described herein may be incorporated into devices such as those described herein.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In use, when a user draws on the aerosol delivery device <b>100</b>, airflow is detected by the flow sensor <b>210</b>, and the heating element <b>220</b> is activated to vaporize components of the aerosol precursor composition. Drawing upon the mouth end of the aerosol delivery device causes ambient air to enter the air intake <b>236</b> and pass through the cavity <b>232</b> in the coupler <b>230</b> and the central opening in the projection <b>234</b> of the base <b>228</b>. In the cartridge <b>104</b>, the drawn air combines with the formed vapor to form an aerosol. The aerosol is whisked, aspirated or otherwise drawn away from the heating element and out the opening <b>224</b> in the mouth end of the aerosol delivery device.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For further detail regarding implementations of an aerosol delivery device including a control body and a cartridge in the case of an electronic cigarette, see the above-cited U.S. patent application Ser.

In various implementations, the exterior overwrap material may comprise a material that resists transfer of heat, which may include a paper or other fibrous material, such as a cellulose material. The exterior overwrap material may also include at least one filler material imbedded or dispersed within the fibrous material. In various implementations, the filler material may have the form of water insoluble particles. Additionally, the filler material may incorporate inorganic components. In various implementations, the exterior overwrap may be formed of multiple layers, such as an underlying, bulk layer and an overlying layer, such as a typical wrapping paper in a cigarette.

In various implementations, the filter may increase the structural integrity of the mouth end of the aerosol source member, and/or provide filtering capacity, if desired, and/or provide resistance to draw. In some implementations one or any combination of the following may be positioned between the aerosol precursor composition and the mouth end: an air gap; phase change materials for cooling air; flavor releasing media; ion exchange fibers capable of selective chemical adsorption; aerogel particles as filter medium; and other suitable materials.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Various implementations of the present disclosure employ one or more conductive heating elements to heat the aerosol precursor composition <b>410</b> of the aerosol source member <b>304</b>. In various implementations, the heating element may be provided in a variety forms, such as in the form of a foil, a foam, a mesh, a hollow ball, a half ball, discs, spirals, fibers, wires, films, yarns, strips, ribbons, or cylinders. Such heating elements often comprise a metal material and are configured to produce heat as a result of the electrical resistance associated with passing an electrical current therethrough. Such resistive heating elements may be positioned in direct contact with, or in proximity to, the aerosol source member and particularly, the aerosol precursor composition of the aerosol source member. The heating element may be located in the control body and/or the aerosol source member. In various implementations, the aerosol precursor composition may include components (i.e., heat conducting constituents) that are imbedded in, or otherwise part of, the substrate portion that may serve as, or facilitate the function of, the heating assembly. Some examples of various heating members and elements are described in U.S. Pat.

Although the heating assembly of various implementations of the present disclosure may take a variety of forms, in the particular implementation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the heating assembly comprises an outer cylinder <b>530</b> and a heating element <b>532</b> (aerosol production component), which in this implementation comprises a plurality of heater prongs that extend from a receiving base <b>534</b> (in various configurations, the heating assembly or more specifically the heater prongs may be referred to as a heater). In the depicted implementation, the outer cylinder comprises a double-walled vacuum tube constructed of stainless steel to maintain heat generated by the heater prongs within the outer cylinder, and more particularly, maintain heat generated by heater prongs within the aerosol precursor composition. In various implementations, the heater prongs may be constructed of one or more conductive materials, including, but not limited to, copper, aluminum, platinum, gold, silver, iron, steel, brass, bronze, graphite, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated, the heating assembly <b>528</b> may extend proximate an engagement end of the housing <b>516</b>, and may be configured to substantially surround a portion of the heated end <b>406</b> of the aerosol source member <b>304</b> that includes the aerosol precursor composition <b>410</b>. In such a manner, the heating assembly may define a generally tubular configuration. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the heating element <b>532</b> (e.g., plurality of heater prongs) is surrounded by the outer cylinder <b>530</b> to create a receiving chamber <b>536</b>. In such a manner, in various implementations the outer cylinder may comprise a nonconductive insulating material and/or construction including, but not limited to, an insulating polymer (e.g., plastic or cellulose), glass, rubber, ceramic, porcelain, a double-walled vacuum structure, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some implementations, one or more portions or components of the heating assembly <b>528</b> may be combined with, packaged with, and/or integral with (e.g., embedded within) the aerosol precursor composition <b>410</b>. For example, in some implementations the aerosol precursor composition may be formed of a material as described above and may include one or more conductive materials mixed therein. In some of these implementations, contacts may be connected directly to the aerosol precursor composition such that, when the aerosol source member is inserted into the receiving chamber of the control body, the contacts make electrical connection with the electrical energy source. Alternatively, the contacts may be integral with the electrical energy source and may extend into the receiving chamber such that, when the aerosol source member is inserted into the receiving chamber of the control body, the contacts make electrical connection with the aerosol precursor composition. Because of the presence of the conductive material in the aerosol precursor composition, the application of power from the electrical energy source to the aerosol precursor composition allows electrical current to flow and thus produce heat from the conductive material. Thus, in some implementations the heating element may be described as being integral with the aerosol precursor composition. As a non-limiting example, graphite or other suitable, conductive material may be mixed with, embedded in, or otherwise present directly on or within the material forming the aerosol precursor composition to make the heating element integral with the medium.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As noted above, in the illustrated implementation, the outer cylinder <b>530</b> may also serve to facilitate proper positioning of the aerosol source member <b>304</b> when the aerosol source member is inserted into the housing <b>516</b>. In various implementations, the outer cylinder of the heating assembly <b>528</b> may engage an internal surface of the housing to provide for alignment of the heating assembly with respect to the housing. Thereby, as a result of the fixed coupling between the heating assembly, a longitudinal axis of the heating assembly may extend substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the housing. In particular, the support cylinder may extend from the opening <b>518</b> of the housing to the receiving base <b>534</b> to create the receiving chamber <b>536</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The heated end <b>406</b> of the aerosol source member <b>304</b> is sized and shaped for insertion into the control body <b>302</b>. In various implementations, the receiving chamber <b>536</b> of the control body may be characterized as being defined by a wall with an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface defining the interior volume of the receiving chamber. For example, in the depicted implementations, the outer cylinder <b>530</b> defines an inner surface defining the interior volume of the receiving chamber. In the illustrated implementation, an inner diameter of the outer cylinder may be slightly larger than or approximately equal to an outer diameter of a corresponding aerosol source member (e.g., to create a sliding fit) such that the outer cylinder is configured to guide the aerosol source member into the proper position (e.g., lateral position) with respect to the control body. Thus, the largest outer diameter (or other dimension depending upon the specific cross-sectional shape of the implementations) of the aerosol source member may be sized to be less than the inner diameter (or other dimension) at the inner surface of the wall of the open end of the receiving chamber in the control body. In some implementations, the difference in the respective diameters may be sufficiently small so that the aerosol source member fits snugly into the receiving chamber, and frictional forces prevent the aerosol source member from being moved without an applied force. On the other hand, the difference may be sufficient to allow the aerosol source member to slide into or out of the receiving chamber without requiring undue force.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the illustrated implementation, the control body <b>302</b> is configured such that when the aerosol source member <b>304</b> is inserted into the control body, the heating element <b>532</b> (e.g., heater prongs) is located in the approximate radial center of at least a portion of the aerosol precursor composition <b>410</b> of the heated end <b>406</b> of the aerosol source member. In such a manner, when used in conjunction with a solid or semi-solid aerosol precursor composition, the heater prongs may be in direct contact with the aerosol precursor composition. In other implementations, such as when used in conjunction with an extruded aerosol precursor composition that defines a tube structure, the heater prongs may be located inside of a cavity defined by an inner surface of the extruded tube structure, and would not contact the inner surface of the extruded tube structure.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">During use, the consumer initiates heating of the heating assembly <b>528</b>, and in particular, the heating element <b>532</b> that is adjacent the aerosol precursor composition <b>410</b> (or a specific layer thereof). Heating of the aerosol precursor composition releases the inhalable substance within the aerosol source member <b>304</b> so as to yield the inhalable substance. When the consumer inhales on the mouth end <b>408</b> of the aerosol source member, air is drawn into the aerosol source member through an air intake <b>538</b> such as openings or apertures in the control body <b>302</b>. The combination of the drawn air and the released inhalable substance is inhaled by the consumer as the drawn materials exit the mouth end of the aerosol source member. In some implementations, to initiate heating, the consumer may manually actuate a pushbutton or similar component that causes the heating element of the heating assembly to receive electrical energy from the battery or other energy source. The electrical energy may be supplied for a pre-determined length of time or may be manually controlled.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some implementations, flow of electrical energy does not substantially proceed in between puffs on the device <b>300</b> (although energy flow may proceed to maintain a baseline temperature greater than ambient temperature&#x2014;e.g., a temperature that facilitates rapid heating to the active heating temperature). In the depicted implementation, however, heating is initiated by the puffing action of the consumer through use of one or more sensors, such as flow sensor <b>520</b>. Once the puff is discontinued, heating will stop or be reduced. When the consumer has taken a sufficient number of puffs so as to have released a sufficient amount of the inhalable substance (e.g., an amount sufficient to equate to a typical smoking experience), the aerosol source member <b>304</b> may be removed from the control body <b>302</b> and discarded. In some implementations, further sensing elements, such as capacitive sensing elements and other sensors, may be used as discussed in U.S. patent application Ser.

In one example implementation, an aluminum foil layer may be laminated to one surface of the aerosol source member. Ceramic materials also may be used. In further implementations, an insulating material may be used so as not to unnecessarily move heat away from the aerosol precursor composition.

In another embodiment, those multiple contact connections described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref> may also be utilized for the first end connector <b>1102</b> and/or the second end connector <b>1104</b> of the PUB instrument <b>1101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a first view of a connector <b>1201</b>. As described above, this connector may be for a cartridge in an ENDS device for connecting with the battery portion. In one embodiment, connector <b>1201</b> couples with the battery portion illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Specifically, the concentric pins of the connector <b>1201</b> couple with the contacts <b>1002</b>, <b>10004</b>, <b>1006</b> of the battery portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The connection of the connector <b>1201</b> may be a friction fit or snap fit. The contacts of the connector <b>1201</b> are concentric pins that couple to corresponding contact points (e.g. contacts <b>1002</b>, <b>10004</b>, <b>1006</b> of the battery portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). In other embodiments, the connector <b>1201</b> may couple a PUB with an electronic smoking article or may be used for different types of components.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> includes a connector <b>1201</b> with three concentric pins. In this embodiment, there are three pins for the connection. In other embodiments, there may be more or fewer pins and contacts. Two pins may be used for the electric current and the third pin may be used for data transfer. In other embodiments, there may be fewer pins or there may be additional pins for further current or communications. Although illustrated as rings or circular, the pins may be other geometric shapes. For example, if the device is oval or rectangular, the concentric pin could be oval or rectangular, respectively. Other geometries are possible for the pins and for the insulators. The shape of the pins and insulators may be determined by the shape of the device to ensure that the pins are accessible and the insulators can maintain separation of the pins. The pins have multiple contact points for the connection and concentric rings is one embodiment to achieve the multiple contact points in the embodiment, where the device is also circular.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The pins may be referred to as rings and are concentric around the axis in some embodiments, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. An inner or center pin <b>1202</b> is on the inside. A middle pin <b>1206</b> is between the other two pins. An outer pin <b>1210</b> is larger than the other two pins. Because the pins are concentric rings, there are multiple contact points along the ring which improves the connection over reliance on a pin with a single contact point.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Between each of the concentric pins is an insulator that separates the concentric pins. The insulators may provide movement or flexibility for a more secure friction fit or snap fit. Insulator <b>1208</b>, <b>1218</b> separate different pins. Specifically, insulator <b>1208</b> separates the outer pin <b>1210</b> and the middle pin <b>1206</b>. The insulator <b>1218</b> separates the middle pin <b>1206</b> from the inner or center pin <b>1202</b>. Since each of the pins may be live with current, they must be separated by the insulators and to ensure the proper connection with the corresponding contact points (e.g. contacts <b>1002</b>, <b>1004</b>, <b>1006</b> of the battery portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Additional insulators <b>1204</b>, <b>1214</b> may provide further insulation. Insulator <b>1204</b> is located between the inner pin <b>1202</b> and the middle pin <b>1206</b>. Insulator <b>1214</b> is adjacent the outer pin <b>1210</b>. In particular, insulators <b>1204</b>, <b>1214</b> may provide flexibility for a more secure friction fit or snap fit by allowing for movement by acting as a cushion for the friction fit.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Each of the pins includes a connection point from which the electric current is further transmitted. For example, the outer pin <b>1210</b> includes a tab <b>1212</b> by which the current can be transmitted to the remainder of the cartridge (not shown), such as the atomizer/vaporizer/heater. The middle ring <b>1206</b> also includes a tab <b>1216</b> from which the current can be transmitted to the remainder of the cartridge (not shown). In one embodiment, the pins are designed to contact with the battery portion (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) and the electric flow is passed to each of the pins. The tabs on each of those pins are for the flow within the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a second view of the connector. The second view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a different angle of the connector <b>1201</b>. For this back side view, the two concentric insulators <b>1208</b> and <b>1218</b> are more clearly visible as separating respective sets of pins. Specifically, insulator <b>1208</b> separates the outer pin <b>1210</b> and the middle pin <b>1206</b>. The insulator <b>1218</b> separates the middle pin <b>1206</b> and the inner pin <b>1202</b>.

The outer pin <b>1210</b> includes tab <b>1212</b> and the middle pin <b>1206</b> includes tab <b>1216</b>. The inner pin <b>1202</b> does not have a separate tab because the inner pin <b>1202</b> extends along the axis, so a tab is unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an exploded view of the connector <b>1201</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates each component of the connector <b>1201</b> separately.
