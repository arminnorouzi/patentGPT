The transport vehicle is loaded with the materials at a predetermined loading position. The transport vehicle travels to a predetermined dumping position and dumps the materials at the dumping position. The dumped materials are spread and leveled by a work machine, such as a bulldozer. The transport vehicle then returns to the loading position from the dumping position and materials are loaded again by the work machine onto the transport vehicle. Conventionally, as described in International Publication No. 2016/167374, a technique for performing the above transport work by the transport vehicle with automatic control is known. In International Publication No. 2016/167374, a controller, such as a processer, determines a target route of the transport vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A hydraulic excavator moves while digging. Also, a bulldozer moves while spreading and leveling the materials. Accordingly, the target route of the transport vehicle changes according to the work conditions of these work machines. Therefore, it is not easy to determine the optimal target route. Also, in order to determine the optimal target route, the load on the controller increases. An object of the present disclosure is to determine the optimal target route of the transport vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SOLUTION TO PROBLEM</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system according to one aspect of the present disclosure is a system for controlling a transport vehicle that transports materials between a first work machine and a second work machine. The system includes a storage device and a controller. The controller is connected to the storage device. The controller acquires a static path indicative of a target route of the transport vehicle. The static path includes a first endpoint and a second endpoint. The static path is set between the first work machine and the second work machine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The controller acquires a first target position for work of the first work machine. The controller determines a first dynamic path that connects the first endpoint and the first target position. The controller acquires a second target position for work of the second work machine. The controller determines a second dynamic path that connects the second endpoint and the second target position. The controller controls the transport vehicle so that the transport vehicle travels according to the static path, the first dynamic path, and the second dynamic path.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method according to another aspect of the present disclosure is a method executed by a controller for controlling a transport vehicle that transports materials between a first work machine and a second work machine. The method includes the following processes. A first process is to acquire a static path indicative of a target route of the transport vehicle. The static path includes a first endpoint and a second endpoint. The static path is set between the first work machine and the second work machine.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second process is to acquire a first target position for work of the first work machine. A third process is to determine a first dynamic path that connects the first endpoint and the first target position. A fourth process is to acquire a second target position for work of the second work machine. A fifth process is to determine a second dynamic path that connects the second endpoint and the second target position. A sixth process is to control the transport vehicle so that the transport vehicle travels according to the static path, the first dynamic path, and the second dynamic path. The execution order of the processes is not limited to the above-mentioned order and may be changed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, the first dynamic path is determined according to the first target position for the work of the first work machine. The second dynamic path is determined according to the second target position for the work of the second work machine. Accordingly, the optimal travel route of the transport vehicle can be determined.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of a work site where a work machine is used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of a transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of a first work machine.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of a second work machine.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of the transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating processes of automatic control of the transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating a method for determining a travel path in an automatic control mode including a static path.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating a method for determining the travel path in the automatic control mode including first, second and third paths associated with the static path.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a front view of the transport vehicle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the method for determining the travel path in the automatic control mode including a first target position in a first work area.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the method for determining the travel path in the automatic control mode including a first dynamic path.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the method for determining the travel path in the automatic control mode including a plurality of second target positions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the method for determining the travel path in the automatic control mode including a second dynamic path.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the traveling of the transport vehicle in the automatic control mode from the first target position.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the traveling of the transport vehicle in the automatic control mode from the second endpoint of the static path.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the traveling of the transport vehicle in the automatic control mode from the second target position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a plan view schematically illustrating the traveling of the transport vehicle in the automatic control mode from the first endpoint of the static path.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, a control system of a transport vehicle according to an embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of a work site where a transport vehicle <b>1</b> is used.
