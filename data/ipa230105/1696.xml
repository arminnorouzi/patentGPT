It will be appreciated that the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale, such as for simplicity and/or clarity of illustration.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">References throughout this specification to one implementation, an implementation, one example, an example, and/or the like means that a particular feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like described in relation to a particular implementation and/or example is included in at least one implementation and/or example of claimed subject matter. Thus, appearances of such phrases, for example, in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily intended to refer to the same implementation and/or example or to any one particular implementation and/or example. Furthermore, it is to be understood that particular features, structures, characteristics, and/or the like described are capable of being combined in various ways in one or more implementations and/or examples and, therefore, are within intended claim scope. In general, of course, as has always been the case for the specification of a patent application, these and other issues have a potential to vary in a particular context of usage. In other words, throughout the disclosure, particular context of description and/or usage provides helpful guidance regarding reasonable inferences to be drawn; however, likewise, &#x201c;in this context&#x201d; in general without further qualification refers to the context of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At times, fluids may be manipulated in fluidic dies, which are blocks of semiconducting material through which both electric signals (e.g., to and from integrated circuit elements) and fluids (e.g., liquids and/or gasses) may travel. In one example, fluids may traverse fluid channels (e.g., microchannels) in a fluidic die in response to actuation of fluid actuators (e.g., thermal resistors, piezo elements, etc.) the actuation of which may occur in response to electric signals. Such operation may be of interest to apply printing fluids to a substrate (e.g., for two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) printing), for manipulating and/or testing biological samples (e.g., blood tests, fluid analysis and/or diagnostics, etc.). Consequently, there may be a desire to deliver fluid to fluidic dies, such as to enable functionality outlined in the preceding examples. Delivering fluid to a fluidic die presents challenges, such as related to complexity and/or cost. For instance, active fluid delivery systems can add cost and complexity to a system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The use of a porous media, such as solid foams (referred to herein as foam), within a fluid reservoir in fluid communication with the fluidic die provides a simple and inexpensive approach to delivering fluid to fluidic dies. However, the use of foams as a fluid delivery mechanism also introduces other challenges. For instance, determining an amount of fluid in a porous media reservoir can be challenging. Fluids may travel relatively slowly though porous media and the distribution of fluid within the porous media is highly variable, for instance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The approach of using conductive members (e.g., conductive pins or needles) at two ends of a fluid reservoir and correlating differences in resistance to different fluid levels within the reservoir may work well (e.g., differences in resistance may be measured relatively quickly and may represent fairly accurate measures of fill level) in non-porous media reservoirs. However, the inclusion of porous media in a reservoir may reduce accuracy of the correlation, such as due to uneven distribution of fluids through the porous media, slow movement of fluids through the porous media, and the limited range of saturation of the porous media surrounding the conductive members (e.g., to avoid the porous media surrounding the conductive members from being dry). Etc.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively, a pressure transducer may be used to measure pressure in the porous media reservoir. While a pressure transducer may offer desired accuracy, resolution, and measurement speed, pressure transducers may be comparatively expensive and take up valuable physical space in a system. And as such, at times, pressure transducers may not be an ideal means of measuring fluid level in a porous media reservoir.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, due at least in part to the porous media, it may be challenging to gain sufficient fill level resolution to provide more than a binary full/not-full fill level reading.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the foregoing in mind, the present description proposes the use of a novel structure and method to measure pressure (and thus, saturation or extractable fluid) within a porous media reservoir. Thus, in one example, a capillary structure may be used in fluid communication with the porous media reservoir. The capillary structure will have parameters (such as dimensions) that are tuned to correspond to parameters of the porous media reservoir such that there is a relationship between saturation or extractable fluid in the porous media reservoir and fluid level in the capillary structure. For instance, in one case, fluid in the capillary structure may respond to changes in pressure within the porous media reservoir, potentially falling below a threshold responsive to fluid exiting the porous media reservoir and remaining above a threshold while sufficient fluid remains in the porous media reservoir. As shall be discussed in greater detail hereinafter, the fluid level in the capillary structure may be sensed in a number of different ways (e.g., based on resistance, capacitance, optically, etc.), thus leading to an estimation of fluid level in the porous media reservoir.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, an internal fluid path of the capillary structure may be formed having different volumetric capacities at different points along the fluid path. For instance, a fluid path may be selected with discrete steps, each step in volumetric capacity corresponding to a different reservoir fill level step. In another example, a tapered fluid path may be used and potentially capable of providing comparatively &#x201c;analog&#x201d; fill level readings that correspond to reservoir fill level.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To illustrate the capillary structure-based porous media reservoir fluid level estimation system, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents a block diagram including a fluidic device <b>100</b>, a fluid reservoir <b>102</b> including a porous media <b>104</b>, and a capillary structure <b>108</b> in fluid communication with fluid reservoir <b>102</b>. As noted, above, fluidic device <b>100</b> may refer to a device to be used to eject a printing fluid onto a media (e.g., a paper, a build material, etc.). For instance, the fluidic device may be an inkjet cartridge, a printbar in a printing device (e.g., 2D or 3D printing device), or other like mechanism of applying printing fluid to a media. Of course, as should be appreciated, claimed subject matter is not limited to such uses of fluidic device <b>100</b>. Other examples may include a platform for testing fluids for the presence of diseases (e.g., testing components of fluids, such as blood, by sorting cells by size, type, etc.) and like mechanisms that may manipulate fluids. In such examples, a porous media reservoir may hold fluids to be used, including blood, plasma, and other fluids (e.g., saline solutions, etc.).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Fluid reservoir <b>102</b> refers to a structure including a void within which fluid (e.g., printing fluid) may be stored and from which fluid may be pushed and/or pulled, such as by a fluidic die (e.g., a fluid ejection die). A porous media <b>104</b> may be arranged within fluid reservoir <b>102</b> and through the cells of which fluids may flow. For instance, porous media <b>104</b> may comprise an open- or closed-cell foam (e.g., polyurethane (PU), polyolefin fibers, or polyethylene (PE) foam, by way of non-limiting example). Porous media <b>104</b> may have a number of parameters <b>106</b>, which may be used to characterize fluid flow through porous media <b>104</b>. To illustrate, a first porous media <b>104</b> having a first set of parameters <b>106</b> may allow fluid to flow (e.g., in response to pressure and the force of gravity) at a first rate, while a second set of parameters <b>106</b> may allow fluid to flow at a second rate, etc. Porous media, such as solid foam, may allow flow of fluids in response to capillary effects. Indeed, the capillary effects may induce a negative pressure within the porous media. And parameters of the porous media may have an effect on the correlation between saturation of the porous media and pressure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Capillary structure <b>108</b> refers to a structure, such as comprising a plastic or a glass body and within which a capillary channel is arranged as illustrated by internal fluid path <b>109</b>. As noted, above, internal fluid path <b>109</b> may be tapered or may include discrete steps such that a volumetric capacity changes as a function of distance along the path. Parameters of capillary structure <b>108</b> may be selected to achieve desired functionality in response to operation of fluid reservoir <b>102</b> and porous media <b>104</b>. For instance, internal fluid path <b>109</b> within capillary structure <b>108</b> may define a fluid path through which fluid may flow in order to indicate fluid levels within fluid reservoir <b>102</b>. For instance, in some cases, capillary structure <b>108</b> may be capable of providing a number of thresholds and/or may provide analog indications of fluid fill level, without limitation. Capillary structure <b>108</b> may be used to indicate, among other things, that reservoir <b>102</b> should be refilled, that a replacement fluidic device <b>100</b> should be installed, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> and supporting discussion will provide additional detail as to tuned parameters <b>110</b> of capillary structure <b>108</b>, but for the present discussion it is enough to understand that there is a relationship between the parameters of porous media <b>104</b> and reservoir <b>102</b> and the tuned parameters (e.g., dimensions, such as a fluid path dimension and/or a fluid fill threshold height, surface energy, etc.) of capillary structure <b>108</b> to enable capillary structure <b>108</b> of providing an indication of fill level within reservoir <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the relationship between porous media <b>104</b> and capillary structure <b>108</b> may be such that fluid fill levels within capillary structure <b>108</b> will change in response to changes in pressure within capillary structure <b>108</b>, as shall be discussed in further detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. In some cases, for instance, negative pressure in reservoir <b>102</b> may become increasingly negative (e.g., as fluid is pulled out of reservoir <b>102</b> into an attached fluidic die) and fluid levels in capillary structure <b>108</b> may fall in response thereto. Conversely, at times, pressure in reservoir <b>102</b> may become less negative, such as in response to fluids being added to reservoir <b>102</b>. In response, fluid levels in capillary structure <b>108</b> may increase. And due to the taper of discrete steps of internal fluid path <b>109</b>, changes in pressure may provide a number of fill level readings by capillary structure <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In view of the foregoing, an example fluidic device (e.g., fluidic device <b>100</b>) includes a fluid reservoir (e.g., fluid reservoir <b>102</b>) and a capillary structure (e.g., capillary structure <b>108</b>). The fluid reservoir has a porous media (e.g., porous media <b>104</b>) arranged within. The capillary structure is in fluid communication with the porous media reservoir and the fluid reservoir and has tuned parameters (e.g., tuned parameters <b>110</b>) corresponding to parameters (e.g., parameters <b>106</b>) of the porous media. The capillary structure also has an internal fluid path (e.g., internal fluid path <b>109</b>) to enable three or more fill readings based on a height of a fluid within the capillary structure and further based on the tuned parameters of the capillary structure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a fluid path <b>209</b> of a capillary structure <b>208</b> (compare with capillary structure <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For simplicity, the outer structure is not illustrated, leaving only fluid path <b>209</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, fluid path <b>209</b> is illustrated as having a rectangular cross section, of course other forms of fluid paths are also contemplated as long as the parameters are tuned to enable use of the capillary structure to indicate fluid level within a fluid reservoir. A fluid <b>205</b> is illustrated within fluid path <b>209</b>. In this example, a lower portion of fluid path <b>209</b> is in closer fluidic proximity to a fluid reservoir (e.g., fluid reservoir <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) than an upper portion of fluid path <b>209</b>, which is open to atmosphere. As such, fluid <b>205</b> is concentrated at the lower portion of fluid path <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> also includes notations of dimensions of fluid path <b>209</b>. A first dimension, d<sub>1</sub>, represents a depth of fluid path <b>209</b> into and out of the page and represents a dimension of particular interest in tuning the capillary structure to the reservoir. A second dimension, d<sub>2</sub>, represents a width of fluid path <b>209</b> across the page. And a third dimension, d<sub>3</sub>, represents a height of fluid <b>205</b> within fluid path <b>209</b> of capillary structure <b>208</b>. D<sub>3 </sub>may refer to a threshold representing a full state. In some cases, another fill level (shown as d<sub>4</sub>) may represent a lower threshold below which the reservoir is considered to be in an empty state. For example, parameters of capillary structure <b>208</b> may be tuned such that fluid in fluid path <b>209</b> reaches d<sub>3 </sub>in response to pressure within the fluid reservoir being approximately &#x2212;1 inches H<sub>2</sub>O (e.g., a &#x201c;full&#x201d; threshold). In another example, the threshold may correspond to approximately &#x2212;2 inches H<sub>2</sub>O. And a lower threshold, such as d<sub>4</sub>, may correspond to a pressure in the reservoir corresponding to approximately &#x2212;4 or &#x2212;5 inches H<sub>2</sub>O, by way of non-limiting example, which may correspond to a capillary pressure in the porous media of the reservoir of an &#x201c;empty&#x201d; state.

Different fluids exhibit different surface tension values. For instance, water has a surface tension of approximately 72.8 mN/m at 20&#xb0; C. By way of further example, some printing fluids may have surface tensions on the order of 20 or 45 mN/m.

Contact angle may depend on the surface energy of the interior of capillary structure <b>208</b> and the surface tension of the fluid in the porous media. For instance, if the surface energy for a structure approximate the surface tension of the fluid, then the contact angle ranges from 0 to 90 degrees. If the surface energy is less than the surface tension, then 0 is greater than 90 degrees and the expression goes negative (indicating fluid repulsion by the capillary structure). For a given size capillary structure, it may be possible to maximize the capillary pressure by pushing the cosine value to 1, which is represented by a contact angle of 0. This may be accomplished by making the surface energy of the structure significantly greater than the surface tension of the fluid. Additionally, there may be an interest in an interior surface that is as wettable as possible to achieve a lower contact angle. This may include the use of a plasma treated surface for plastic capillary structures.

At intermediate fill states of the porous media reservoir, fluid fill level within fluid path <b>209</b> will be up to one of B, C, or D. For instance, at times at which the porous media reservoir is &#xbe; full (corresponding to &#x2212;4.5 inches H<sub>2</sub>O), fluid fill level within fluid path <b>209</b> will be up to D; at times at which the porous media reservoir is &#xbd; full (corresponding to &#x2212;5.5 inches H<sub>2</sub>O), fluid fill level within fluid path <b>209</b> will be up to C; and at times at which the porous media reservoir is &#xbc; full (corresponding to &#x2212;6 inches H<sub>2</sub>O), fluid fill level within fluid path <b>209</b> will be up to B. It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is not to scale, but is drawn to render dimensional differences more distinguishable. Additionally, it is noted that while fluid path <b>209</b> may have the stepped profile in some cases, other implementations may instead use a smoothed profile that may potentially provide more resolution in pressure readings.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">With the foregoing in mind, one example fluidic device (e.g., fluidic device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may include a tapered internal fluid path and/or may have discrete steps in volumetric capacity (see, e.g., fluid path <b>209</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). It is noted that the changes in volumetric capacity may be due to changes in dimension d<sub>1 </sub>in one implementation, while dimension d<sub>2 </sub>remains static. For instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the internal fluid path of the capillary structure contains at least four distinct volumetric capacities along the length of the internal fluid path. A first of the at least four distinct volumetric capacities may correspond to a full reservoir level and a second of the at least four distinct volumetric capacities corresponds to an empty reservoir level. And the parameters (e.g., parameters <b>106</b>) of the reservoir are such that the reservoir in a full state corresponds with pressure of approximately &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;2 inches H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">In this example, the internal fluid path of the capillary structure is tapered, and the smaller volumetric capacity of the two extremities of the internal fluid path is in closer fluid proximity to the fluid reservoir than the larger volumetric capacity (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">As discussed above, the use of a capillary structure in fluid communication may be desirable, such as to provide an indication of fluid levels within a fluid reservoir. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate operation of one fluidic device <b>300</b>, according to one implementation. It is noted that like numbered elements (e.g., <b>100</b> and <b>300</b>) are to be understood as being similar in structure and/or operation. For instance, fluidic device <b>300</b> is to be understood as having a structure and/or operation that is similar to that of fluidic device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. It is noted, however, that particular aspects of later elements are not to be read back into earlier elements. For instance, fluidic device <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> is illustrated as being a fluidic device of a printing device. But fluidic device <b>100</b> is not necessarily part of a printing device. Additionally, in some cases, aspects of one implementation are not intended to be applied to all similar elements. For instance, in one implementation, fluidic device <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> may be discussed in the context of a thermal inkjet (TIJ) printing device, but this example is not intended to limit the scope of other (e.g., earlier and/or later) examples to TIJ devices.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a point in time at which capillary structure <b>308</b> is filled, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a point in time at which fluidic device <b>300</b> is used to eject fluid, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a point in time at which fluidic device <b>300</b> is refilled.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">As illustrated, fluidic device <b>300</b> is illustrated as having a fluid reservoir <b>302</b> with porous media <b>304</b> arranged therein. An air gap <b>307</b> is illustrated above porous media <b>304</b>. Within porous media <b>304</b>, fluid may be of different concentrations, such as due to gravity. For instance, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a lower portion <b>313</b>B of porous media <b>304</b> is fully saturated, while a smaller upper portion <b>313</b>A of porous media <b>304</b> is more lightly saturated. Of course, it is to be understood that rather than two distinct regions of saturations, saturation of porous media <b>304</b> may be more gradient-like in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">Capillary structure <b>308</b> is illustrated in fluid communication with fluid reservoir <b>302</b> via an intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b> and a fluid passage <b>340</b>. Intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b> may comprise a same or similar porous media as porous media <b>304</b> (e.g., such that tuned parameters of capillary structure correspond with porous media <b>304</b> and the porous media of intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b>). It is noted that a lower portion of capillary structure <b>308</b> is thus in closer fluidic proximity to fluid reservoir <b>302</b> than an upper portion of capillary structure <b>308</b>. A fluid inlet <b>303</b> is also illustrated in a top portion of reservoir <b>302</b> and through which additional fluid may be added to reservoir <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">Fluidic device <b>300</b> is also illustrated as having a fluidic die <b>314</b>, which ejects fluids (ejected fluid droplets <b>318</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. Ejection of fluid may be enabled by fluid actuators, such as thermal resistive or piezoelectric elements, by way of non-limiting example. For example, fluidic die <b>314</b> may include a number of fluid channels (e.g., microchannels) through which fluids may travel towards ejection chambers. Actuators may be arranged within the ejection chambers in order to cause fluid droplets to exit orifices (e.g., nozzles) of fluidic die <b>314</b>. In one example, as fluid droplets are ejected from fluidic die <b>314</b>, additional fluid may be pulled into fluidic die <b>314</b> from fluid reservoir <b>302</b> due, at least in part, to capillary forces to replace fluid volumes ejected. In other examples, reservoir <b>302</b> may also be pressurized (e.g., primed) such that as fluids are ejected from fluidic die <b>314</b>, corresponding amounts of fluids are drawn into fluid reservoir <b>302</b> from an external source. Additionally, some examples may further include a fluidic pump to push fluid into fluid reservoir <b>302</b> in addition to the fluidic forces due to capillary effects at fluidic die <b>314</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">Capillary structure <b>308</b> may need to be calibrated as part of a setup process. For instance, in one case, fluidic device <b>300</b> may be shipped in an &#x201c;empty&#x201d; state in which no fluid (or only shipping fluid) is present in reservoir <b>302</b>. In such examples, capillary structure <b>308</b> may not be filled with fluid or may not have fluid present at desired levels. Thus, upon installation in a system (e.g., printing system), capillary structure <b>308</b> may have to be calibrated to represent fluid level within reservoir <b>302</b>. Of course, in other cases, fluidic device <b>300</b> may be calibrated prior to shipping, and thus an initial calibration of capillary structure <b>308</b> may not be necessary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an initial calibration stage in which fluid is pulled into capillary structure corresponding to (and indicative of) fluid level of fluid reservoir <b>302</b>. For example, fluid reservoir <b>302</b> may be filled and primed (e.g., pressurized and prepared for operation of fluidic die <b>314</b>). Priming of fluid reservoir <b>302</b> may include engendering backpressure in fluid reservoir <b>302</b>. In order to cause fluid to flow into capillary structure <b>308</b>, capillary structure <b>308</b> may have to be pressurized separately (e.g., application of a pressure such that a pressure&#x2014;a negative pressure&#x2014;in capillary structure <b>308</b> is greater&#x2014;more negative&#x2014;than that of fluid reservoir <b>302</b>). Further, in cases in which capillary structure <b>308</b> is external to reservoir <b>302</b>, a vacuum may be applied to capillary structure <b>308</b> to cause saturation of an intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b> and filling of capillary structure <b>308</b>. Thus, fluid may flow into capillary structure <b>308</b> while the pressure (e.g., negative pressure) in capillary structure <b>308</b> is greater (e.g., more negative in the context of a negative pressure) than the pressure (e.g., negative pressure) in fluid reservoir <b>302</b>, as represented by P<sub>C</sub>Porous media&#x3c;P<sub>C</sub>Capillary, where the subscript &#x201c;C&#x201d; indicates that the pressure is a comparison of the capillary pressure in the porous media versus the capillary pressure in the capillary structure. And this would apply for each volumetric capacity step (e.g., change in d<sub>1</sub>) of the capillary fluid path. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates fluid flow using arrows, from fluid reservoir <b>302</b> to fluid passage <b>340</b>, out of intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b>, and within capillary structure <b>308</b>. This indication of fluid flow may be due to pressure imbalance, as fluid seeks to move into capillary structure <b>308</b> to achieve an equilibrium state. As noted, previously, parameters of capillary structure <b>308</b> may be tuned in order to achieve desired fill levels within capillary structure <b>308</b> in response to fluid levels within fluid reservoir <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, an illustration of operation of fluidic device <b>300</b> while ejecting fluid droplets <b>318</b> from fluidic die <b>314</b>.

In addition to affecting pressure within fluid reservoir <b>302</b>, the capillary action also causes fluid to leave capillary structure <b>308</b> and intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b>, as illustrated by the arrows in capillary structure <b>308</b> and intermediate porous media chamber <b>338</b>.

For instance, as shown by E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the full state of the reservoir corresponds to a full state fill level within the internal fluid path.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate an implementation in which capillary structure <b>308</b> is external to fluid reservoir <b>302</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an implementation in which capillary structure <b>408</b> is arranged within fluid reservoir <b>402</b> of fluidic device <b>400</b>. Parameters of capillary structure <b>408</b> may be tuned to achieve a fill level threshold within capillary structure <b>408</b> that corresponds to a fill level within reservoir <b>402</b>. For instance, in this example, portion <b>412</b><i>b </i>of porous media <b>404</b> is illustrated as being in a saturated state, while portion <b>412</b><i>a </i>is in a semi-saturated state. This state of saturation may be considered, in some examples, as corresponding to &#x201c;full,&#x201d; and dimensions of a fluid path of capillary structure <b>408</b> may be selected to achieve the fill level illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. And additional fluid may be added via fluid inlet <b>403</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">While this implementation may be beneficial as contrasted with implementations in which a capillary structure is external to the fluid reservoir (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>), it may raise challenges, as well, such as reading fluid level within the capillary structure. For instance, in an internal capillary structure implementation, level sensing implementations that use electromechanical means may use additional structure (e.g., electronics, leads, etc.) within the reservoir, which may add complexity to the device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">With the foregoing in mind, in one example fluidic device (e.g., fluidic device <b>400</b>), the capillary structure (e.g., capillary structure <b>408</b>) may arranged within a fluid reservoir (e.g., fluid reservoir <b>402</b>) and a first end of the capillary structure is in proximity with a bottom portion (e.g., portion <b>412</b><i>b</i>) of the reservoir and a second end of the capillary structure is in proximity to a top portion of the reservoir (e.g., above portion <b>412</b><i>a</i>) within an air gap <b>407</b> (which may be at atmospheric pressure).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a chart illustrating pressure readings in a fluid reservoir (e.g., fluid reservoir <b>302</b> or <b>402</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C or <b>4</b></figref>, respectively) corresponding to fluid levels in a capillary structure (e.g., capillary structure <b>308</b> or <b>408</b>). These example readings are based on experimental data and illustrate a relationship between fluid level in a capillary structure in fluid communication with a porous media fluid reservoir. Indeed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> compares the passage of time while firing actuators of a fluidic die to eject fluid droplets with capillary pressure within a porous media of a fluidic device. It is noted that the passage of time is merely used to assist in identifying fill levels. Of greater interest is the fact that as the capillary pressure within the fluid reservoir decreases from &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;5 inches H<sub>2</sub>O, the capillary structure starts to drain (see, e.g., (a), (b), (c), and (d)) such that by &#x2212;4 inches H<sub>2</sub>O it has reached a nearly empty state (see, e.g., (e)). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also shows that the capillary structure remains in the nearly empty state (see, e.g., the gap between (e) until (f)) until the capillary pressure of the reservoir returns to &#x2212;2 inches H<sub>2</sub>O (see, e.g., (g)). at which point it continues to fill as the pressure in the reservoir returns to &#x2212;1 inches H<sub>2</sub>O (see, e.g., (h) and (i)). In practice, whether or not the capillary structure refills depends on whether the pore(s) in fluid communication with the fluid path of the capillary structure still has fluid (e.g., and thus maintains pressure within the capillary structure). If the relevant pore(s) of the porous media dry out however, a vacuum pressure will have to be applied to the capillary structure re-calibrate the capillary structure. Whether or not the pore(s) in question dry out, thus, can be approximated by using a pressure threshold. Said otherwise, a pressure threshold may be set corresponding to a likelihood that the pore(s) dries out and used as a shorthand or approximation of a point to avoid crossing, such as in terms of porous media saturation and capillary pressure. Using this approximation, the experimental behavior in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates that the capillary structure operates as desired with respect to an example threshold negative pressure (e.g., &#x2212;6 inches H<sub>2</sub>O in one example, &#x2212;9 inches H<sub>2</sub>O in another, etc. depending on the particular tuned parameters of the capillary structure) within the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">While these drawings are illustrative of a binary full/not-full implementation, it is to be understood that consistent with the foregoing description, a tapered or step-based capillary structure may yield a number of different fill level readings.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref> illustrate a number of fluid level detection implementations for determining whether fluid in the capillary structure corresponds to a full or non-full state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates an optical sensing-based implementation; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a capacitive sensing-based implementation; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrates a resistive sensing-based implementation; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> illustrates a MEMS-based sensing implementation.

For instance, example instructions may include instructions to determine fluid level within a capillary structure, instructions to turn on and off a pressurization mechanism, instructions to actuate fluid actuators to cause ejection of fluid droplets, etc. Controller <b>1065</b> may comprise one or more processing mechanisms, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and general-purpose processors, by way of non-limiting example. Memory <b>1066</b> refers to structure capable of storing signals or states, and may include volatile and non-volatile memory including, without limitation, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), magnetic memory, phase change memory, and the other suitable means of storing signals, states, and values.
