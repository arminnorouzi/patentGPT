Wireless devices can experience losses over the wireless connection, e.g., packet losses, failed transmissions, and failed retransmissions when the connection is at the edge of its link budget or where interference is present. For example, should the wireless devices of the system be moved away from each other, so as to increase the distance between a source and a sink device, there will come a point where the distance between the devices will cause increased packet loss. Similarly, in circumstances where the devices of the system are subject to other forms of environmental interference, e.g., the existence of the plurality of other wireless communications in the vicinity, the presence of an object (e.g., a user's body, or wall) between the devices that could reduce signal strength, the link budget will be strained and will eventually experience decreases in quality.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure provides methods and systems for improving the robustness of wireless communications.

Furthermore, error correction codes can be sent before the transmission of one or more of the packets utilized to calculate a given error correction code packet or can be sent well after the transmission of any such packets (e.g., pre or post transmissions).

The methods and systems provided transmit data packets over a first isochronous stream and transmit one or more supplemental data packets over the same time intervals. The one or more supplemental data packets are used to re-create and/or enhance at least a portion of one or more data packets of the plurality of data packets that have already been sent. Alternatively, the one or more supplemental data packets are used to create and/or enhance at least a portion of one or more data packets of the plurality of data packets that will be received during the next isochronous intervals. The methods and system described herein allow for increased robustness by allowing for better retransmission with correctly received packets and the methods set forth herein work with any Bluetooth broadcaster sink without modification.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By way of example, in the context of LE Audio, the broadcast topology, there is no feedback mechanism to the broadcasting device (or source device) with information from the receiving device(s) (or sink device(s)). Therefore, the broadcasting device does not know whether packets were received by the receiving device(s), and thus, the broadcasting device defaults to providing equal priority to all packets and uses the same amount of bandwidth for each packet. However, in a bandwidth constrained broadcast scenario, it is likely that the number of packets lost during the broadcasting is relatively high (and especially higher than what could have been achieved under the LE Audio unicast topology). Therefore, the present disclosure provides methods to significantly increase the retransmission effort with no to minimal bandwidth cost. Such retransmission improvements can provide up to a factor of eight over the retransmission cost used by the default Bluetooth Core 5.2 standard that defines the LE Audio broadcast topology. In addition, the techniques variously described herein allow devices that are not operating in such an improved manner to receive the broadcast stream but without the added robustness, thereby allowing receiving or sink devices that are operating under the default Bluetooth Core 5.2 LE Audio broadcast topology to still work with the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;wearable audio device&#x201d; as used in this disclosure, in addition to including its ordinary meaning or its meaning known to those skilled in the art, is intended to mean a device that fits around, on, in, or near an ear (including open-ear audio devices worn on the head or shoulders of a user) and that radiates acoustic energy into or towards the ear. Wearable audio devices are sometimes referred to as headphones, earphones, earpieces, headsets, earbuds or sport headphones, and can be wired or wireless. A wearable audio device includes an acoustic driver to transduce audio signals to acoustic energy. The acoustic driver can be housed in an earcup. While some of the figures and descriptions following can show a single wearable audio device, having a pair of earcups (each including an acoustic driver) it should be appreciated that a wearable audio device can be a single stand-alone unit having only one earcup. Each earcup of the wearable audio device can be connected mechanically to another earcup or headphone, for example by a headband and/or by leads that conduct audio signals to an acoustic driver in the ear cup or headphone. A wearable audio device can include components for wirelessly receiving audio signals. A wearable audio device can include components of an active noise reduction (ANR) system. Wearable audio devices can also include other functionality such as a microphone so that they can function as a headset. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows examples of an in-the-ear headphone form factor, an eyeglass form factor, and an over-the-ear headset, in other examples the wearable audio device can be an on-ear, around-ear, behind-ear, or near-ear headset. In some examples, the wearable audio device can be an open-ear device that includes an acoustic driver to radiate acoustic energy towards the ear while leaving the ear open to its environment and surroundings.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The term &#x201c;connected isochronous stream&#x201d; as used in this disclosure, in addition to including its ordinary meaning or its meaning known to those skilled in the art, is intended to refer to an isochronous data stream which utilizes a preestablished, point-to-point communication link over LE Audio between, e.g., a source device (which may also be known as a central or master device) and an audio device or a plurality of audio devices (which may also be known as a peripheral or slave device(s)).

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it should be appreciated that each sink device <b>104</b> can also include at least one speaker, i.e., sink speaker <b>130</b>, which is, e.g., a loudspeaker or acoustic transducer, that is electrically connected to sink processor <b>120</b> and sink memory <b>122</b> and configured to electromechanically convert an electrical signal into audible acoustic energy within the environment surrounding each sink device, e.g., an audio playback. In some examples, the electrical signal and the audible acoustic energy are associated with the data included in the wireless connection <b>132</b> (discussed below). Furthermore, and although not illustrated, each sink controller <b>118</b> can include one or more clocks or time-keeping circuits configured to keep independent time during operation of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each device of system <b>100</b>, i.e., source device <b>102</b> and each sink device <b>104</b>, can use their respective communication modules to establish one or more wireless connections <b>132</b>A-<b>132</b>C (collectively referred to as &#x201c;wireless connections <b>132</b>&#x201d;) between the source device <b>102</b> and each sink device <b>104</b>. Each wireless connection <b>132</b> can be used to send and/or receive wireless data via one or more wireless data streams between the source device <b>102</b> and each sink device <b>104</b>. In some examples, each data stream is an isochronous data stream <b>136</b>A-<b>136</b>C (collectively referred to as &#x201c;isochronous data streams <b>136</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;isochronous streams <b>136</b>&#x201d;), e.g., a connected isochronous stream using LE Audio standard. In other examples, as will be described below, the isochronous data streams <b>136</b> are broadcast isochronous streams, e.g., where the source device <b>102</b> is configured to broadcast one or more isochronous streams <b>136</b> that are received by one or more sink devices <b>104</b>. For example, source device <b>102</b> can be configured to generate, broadcast, or otherwise wirelessly transmit one or more wireless data streams that are received by each sink device <b>104</b>. It should be appreciated that the streams established over each wireless connection <b>132</b> can use various wireless data protocols, standards, or methods of transmission e.g., Bluetooth Low-Energy Protocols, the Bluetooth Low-Energy ISO transport protocol or the LE Audio standard. In some examples, these protocols are used to send, receive, or otherwise transmit audio data, e.g., data used by sink devices <b>104</b> to generate audible acoustic energy in the form of an audio playback. However, it should be appreciated that these protocols are not limited to transmission of audio data and include other types of data.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>6</b></figref>, Each isochronous stream <b>136</b> includes one or more packets of a plurality of data packets <b>138</b>A-<b>138</b>D (collectively referred to as &#x201c;data packets <b>138</b>&#x201d;) and/or one or more of a plurality of supplemental data packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>H (collectively referred to as &#x201c;supplemental packets <b>140</b>&#x201d;). Data packets <b>138</b>, as described herein, are sent by source device <b>102</b> to one or more sink devices <b>104</b>, and can include data used by the one or more sink devices <b>104</b> to generate or render audible acoustic energy, e.g., an audio playback. In other words, data packets <b>138</b> can include audio data and/or one or more frames of audio data that can be used to generate audible acoustic energy using the sink speakers <b>130</b> of each sink device <b>104</b> discussed above. To that end, data packets <b>138</b> can be framed or unframed packets. For example, framed packets can include a header and a payload whereas unframed packets do not include the packet header. In some examples, the header can include fields for segmentation header data and time offset data while the payload includes the encoded wireless data to be transferred from one device to the other. For example, if the data to be transferred is audio data associated with one or more audio files, the payload can include audio data in the form of one or more frames of encoded audio data. In an unframed arrangement, during the initial negotiation of the wireless connections <b>132</b>, the source controller <b>106</b> and each of the sink controllers <b>118</b> can negotiate and agree on the parameters normally specified in the header of each packet so that each device knows what type of data and what parameters will be used when sending and receiving the data, rendering the inclusion of the header redundant and not necessary.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each supplemental packet <b>140</b>, in addition to being framed or unframed, can include data intended to correct, recover, or enhance data sent within one or more of the plurality of data packets <b>138</b>. For example, as will be discussed below in detail, each supplemental packet <b>140</b> can include error correcting code or error correction code intended to aid each sink device <b>104</b> in recovering or recreating at least a portion of one or more data packets <b>138</b> that were not successfully received from within the one or more isochronous streams <b>136</b>. Alternatively or additionally, each supplemental data packet can include additional data related to one or more data packets <b>138</b> that were successfully received from the one or more isochronous streams <b>136</b> that can be used by each sink device <b>104</b> to enhance the data already received. For example, if the data packets <b>138</b> included audio data or frames of audio data encoded at a lower bitrate or lower quality (e.g., 72 kbps), the supplemental packets <b>140</b> could provide additional audio data (e.g., 72 kbps) that would effectively raise the bitrate and thus raise the quality of the audio decoded for each frame (to e.g., 144 kbps). It should be appreciated that, the supplemental packets <b>140</b> can be encrypted such that only authorized sink devices <b>104</b> can access the error correcting or enhancing capabilities afforded by the supplemental packets <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As will be described below, in some examples, the supplemental packets <b>140</b> include error correcting codes. In some examples, the error correcting codes can be selected from any hard decision block bodes, e.g., can be selected from at least one of: Reed-Solomon coding, Multidimensional parity, or Hamming codes. It should be appreciated that convolutional codes can also be used, however this will lead to a soft decision and may increase the error correcting performance at the cost of artifacts, e.g., audio artifacts when the soft decision leads to an incorrect result. Additionally, for the block codes chosen, the parity format used can be Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) 5 and RAID 6 as they do not require significant memory and processing on the decoder side, e.g., at the sink controller <b>118</b> side.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>6</b></figref>, which illustrates one example configuration, data packets <b>138</b> and supplemental packets <b>140</b> are sent via one or more isochronous streams, e.g., streams that send packets during predetermined isochronous time intervals along time T, e.g., isochronous intervals <b>142</b>A-<b>142</b>D (collectively referred to as &#x201c;isochronous intervals <b>142</b>&#x201d;). Each isochronous interval <b>142</b> can include a plurality of isochronous events and isochronous sub-events, which divide and sub-divide each Bluetooth isochronous interval based on the initial negotiation of a given wireless connection. Additionally, data packets <b>138</b> and supplemental packets <b>140</b> can be sent within the same isochronous stream <b>136</b> or within different isochronous streams <b>136</b>, e.g., via different frequencies or channels. In one example, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, data packets <b>138</b> are sent in a first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A using a first frequency <b>144</b>, while supplemental data packets <b>140</b> are sent in a second isochronous stream <b>136</b>B which uses a second frequency <b>146</b> different than the first frequency <b>144</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, the supplemental packets <b>140</b> sent via the second isochronous stream <b>136</b>B are temporally shifted with respect to the data packets <b>138</b> sent via the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A. Due to this temporal shift such that no overlap occurs between the packets of each respective stream, it should be appreciated that both the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A and the second isochronous stream <b>136</b>B can both be generated by the same radio, e.g., source radio <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, which illustrates one example of system <b>100</b>, source device <b>102</b> is configured to send via a first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A, and at a first frequency <b>144</b>, a plurality of data packets <b>138</b>A-<b>138</b>D. Additionally, source device <b>102</b> is also configured to send via a second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B, at a second frequency <b>146</b> different from the first frequency <b>144</b>, a plurality of supplemental data packets <b>140</b>. Specifically, as illustrated, within the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A, the source device <b>102</b> is configured to send a first data packet <b>138</b>A (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> as a shaded square with the number &#x201c;1&#x201d; displayed thereon), and one or more retransmission packets that include an identical payload to first data packet <b>138</b>A (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> as white squares with the number &#x201c;1&#x201d; displayed thereon). Following the transmission of first data packet <b>138</b>A and both of the retransmitted packets associated with first data packet <b>138</b>A, and within the first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A, source device <b>102</b> is also configured to transmit, via the second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B, one or more supplemental packets <b>140</b>, i.e., supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B. As discussed above, each of the supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B can contain error correcting code calculated based on one or more data packets <b>138</b> that can be used by one or more sink devices <b>104</b> to recover or re-create data packets <b>138</b>. Alternatively, as discussed above, supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B can contain additional data, e.g., additional audio data or audio frames, used to enhance, or add to the data successfully obtained in, e.g., first data packet <b>138</b>A. Furthermore, and similarly to the packets sent during the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A, source device <b>102</b> is configured to send a second data packet <b>138</b>B, a third data packet <b>138</b>C, and a fourth data packet <b>138</b>D (all shown as shaded squares numbered 2-4, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), during the second isochronous interval <b>142</b>B, the third isochronous interval <b>142</b>C, and the fourth isochronous interval <b>142</b>D, respectively. Additionally, each respective packet can be followed by one or more retransmitted packets (shown as white squares number 2-4, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Also, within the second isochronous stream <b>136</b>B, and during each isochronous interval <b>142</b>, source device <b>102</b> is configured to send one or more supplemental packets <b>140</b>, e.g., supplemental packets <b>140</b>C and <b>140</b>D during the second isochronous interval <b>142</b>B, supplemental packets <b>140</b>E and <b>140</b>F during the third isochronous interval <b>142</b>C, and supplemental packets <b>140</b>G and <b>140</b>H during the fourth isochronous interval <b>142</b>D. Supplemental packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>H are illustrated as boxes with cross-hatchings. It should be appreciated that supplemental packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>H are also temporally shifted with respect to data packets <b>138</b> and their respective retransmitted packets such that no overlap between the data packets and the supplemental packets occur. Thus, a single radio, i.e., source radio <b>116</b>, can broadcast data packets <b>138</b>, the respective retransmitted packets associated with data packets <b>138</b>, and the supplemental packets <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates one example of system <b>100</b> including recovery of a missing data packet using supplemental packets <b>140</b> with error correcting code. As shown, each supplemental packet <b>140</b> can include error correcting code calculated using data from one or more data packets <b>138</b>A-<b>138</b>D. For example, as shown, first data packet <b>138</b>A and second data packet <b>138</b>B are successfully received, while third data packet <b>138</b>C is lost (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> by a solid &#x201c;X&#x201d; over third data packet <b>138</b>C and its respective retransmission packets). Additionally, supplemental packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>D are sent via a second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B. Since supplemental packet <b>140</b>C can include error correcting code calculated using data packets <b>138</b>A-<b>138</b>B, the error correcting code of the supplemental data packet <b>140</b>C can be used to calculate and recover the missing packet (e.g., <b>138</b>C) and pass the data from the missing packet to the sink device <b>104</b> for use in decoding the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A. In other words, the error correcting code within supplemental packet <b>140</b>C can re-create missing or lost data packet <b>138</b>C using the data from first data packet <b>138</b>A, second data packet <b>138</b>B, and supplemental packet <b>140</b>C (shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). It should be appreciated that the error correcting code within a given supplemental packet <b>140</b> can be calculated using one or more data packets <b>138</b>. For example, although not illustrated, supplemental packet <b>140</b>A and/or <b>140</b>B can be calculated based on two data packets, i.e., first data packet <b>138</b>A and second data packet <b>138</b>B. Thus, should at least one of these data packets and one of the supplemental packets be successfully received, the missing data packet can be recovered. Additionally, it should be appreciated that, within the second isochronous stream <b>136</b>B, multiple supplemental packets <b>140</b> are sent within a single isochronous interval, e.g., supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B are sent within the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A. In this example, supplemental packet <b>140</b>A can include error correcting codes or additional data used to enhance one or more packets <b>138</b>, while supplemental packet <b>140</b>B is a retransmission of supplemental packet <b>140</b>A, i.e., supplemental packet <b>140</b>B has an identical payload to supplemental packet <b>140</b>A.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the plurality of data packets <b>138</b> can include a first plurality of data packets <b>148</b>A-<b>148</b>D (collectively referred to as &#x201c;first plurality of packets <b>148</b>&#x201d;) and a second plurality of data packets <b>150</b>A-<b>150</b>D (collectively referred to as &#x201c;second plurality of packets <b>150</b>&#x201d;). As illustrated, the first plurality of packets <b>148</b> are transmitted via a first isochronous stream, i.e., first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A, while the second plurality of data packets <b>150</b> are transmitted via a second isochronous stream, i.e., second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B. It should be appreciated that first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A can be transmitted using a first frequency <b>144</b> while second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B can be transmitted using a second frequency <b>146</b> different than the first frequency <b>144</b>. Additionally, second plurality of packets <b>150</b> can be temporally shifted with respect to first plurality of packets <b>148</b> such that there is no temporal overlap in the airtime used to send each packet of the respective pluralities. Thus, a single radio, e.g., source radio <b>116</b>, can be used to send both the first plurality of data packets <b>148</b> and the second plurality of data packets <b>150</b>. The first plurality of data packets <b>148</b> include audio data or frames of audio data associated with a left-channel audio stream while the second plurality of data packets <b>150</b> include audio data or frames of audio data associated with a right-channel audio stream. In other words, for stereo applications, left-channel audio can be sent via a separate channel or frequency while right-channel audio can be sent via another separate channel or frequency. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, first plurality of data packets <b>148</b>A-<b>148</b>D and second plurality of data packets <b>150</b>A-<b>150</b>D are illustrated as shaded boxes with numbers 1-4, respectively, displayed thereon. Additionally, the retransmitted packets associated with each of these packets are illustrated as white boxes with corresponding numbers 1-4 displayed thereon. Furthermore, supplemental data packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>H are illustrated as boxes with cross-hatchings.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Similarly to the supplemental packets <b>140</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, supplemental data packets <b>140</b> can be sent via yet another separate channel or frequency. For example, a third isochronous stream, i.e., third broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>C can be used to transmit supplemental data packets <b>140</b> via a third frequency <b>152</b>, where the third frequency <b>152</b> is different from the first frequency <b>144</b> and the second frequency <b>146</b>. Furthermore, supplemental packets <b>140</b> can be temporally offset or shifted with respect to both first plurality of packets <b>148</b> and second plurality of packets <b>150</b>. By temporally shifting the first plurality of packets <b>148</b>, the second plurality of packets <b>150</b>, and the supplemental packets <b>140</b> with respect to each other and such that none of these packets are transmitted at the same time, a single radio, e.g., source radio <b>116</b>, can be used to transmit all three isochronous streams <b>136</b>A-<b>136</b>C.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, it should be appreciated that supplemental packets <b>140</b>A-<b>140</b>H can include error correction code calculated based on one or more of the first plurality of packets <b>148</b> and/or one or more packets of the second plurality of packets <b>150</b>. For example, within the each isochronous interval, one or more data packet of the first plurality of packets <b>148</b> and two retransmitted packets associated with each respective data packet <b>148</b> are sent within a first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A while one or more data packets of the second plurality of packets <b>150</b> and two retransmitted packets associated with the each respective data packet <b>150</b> are sent within a second broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>B. Following the transmission of these data packets and their respective retransmitted packets, and within each isochronous interval <b>142</b>, two supplemental packets <b>140</b> are sent via a third broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>C. within each isochronous interval, one of the two supplemental packets <b>140</b> can include error correcting code calculated based on one or more packets of the first plurality of packets <b>148</b> while the other supplemental packet <b>140</b> can be calculated based on one or more packets of the second plurality of packets <b>150</b>. In other words, within each isochronous interval <b>142</b>, two supplemental packets <b>140</b> are sent. The error correcting code within one of the two supplemental packets will be calculated based on the packets associated with the left-channel audio stream while the error correcting code in the other supplemental packet will be calculated based on packets associated with the right-channel audio stream. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, supplemental packet <b>140</b>C can be calculated based on data packets <b>148</b>A and <b>148</b>B, while supplemental packet <b>140</b>D can be calculated based on data packets <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B. In this way, should either of packets <b>148</b>A or <b>148</b>B be lost while the other is successfully received, supplemental packet <b>140</b>C can recover or re-create the missing packet. Similarly, should either of packets <b>150</b>A or <b>150</b>B be lost while the other is successfully received, supplemental packet <b>140</b>D can recover or re-create the missing packet.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, supplemental packets can be sent in advance of one or more corresponding data packets or after the corresponding packets. For example, as shown, supplemental packet <b>140</b>A (denoted as a cross-hatched square with the letter &#x201c;R&#x201d; displayed thereon) can contain error correcting code calculated based on the data of first packet <b>138</b>A and second packet <b>138</b>B. As supplemental packet <b>140</b>A is sent temporally between first packet <b>138</b>A and second packet <b>138</b>B, supplemental packet <b>140</b>A is said to be a pretransmission, i.e., it was sent temporally before at least one packet from which its error correcting code was calculated. As such, the first supplemental packet <b>140</b> sent within each isochronous interval <b>142</b> can be a pretransmitted packet with error correcting code calculated based on the packets sent immediately before it and the packets sent immediately after it within the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A. For example, supplemental packet <b>140</b>C is calculated based on data packet <b>138</b>B and data packet <b>138</b>C and supplemental packet <b>140</b>E is calculated based on data packet <b>140</b>C and data packet <b>140</b>D. It should be appreciated that the supplemental packets illustrated contain letters displayed on each representative square that signify progress through a sequential order of packets with an alphabetical display order. For example, supplemental packets <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>C, and <b>140</b>E contain sequential payloads denoted as R, S, and T to show that each of these supplemental packets are in a logical alphabetical order with respect to each other. To increase the robustness of the system discussed herein, the second supplemental packet <b>140</b> sent within each isochronous interval <b>142</b> can be a post transmission or post retransmitted packet in that each post retransmitted packet can be calculated based on one or more packets sent well in advance of the post retransmitted packet. For example, as shown, the payloads associated with the retransmitted packets can be shifted in time such that the payload being retransmitted is one or more full isochronous intervals in the future with respect to the data packets used to calculate the error correction code that it retains. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the second supplemental packets <b>140</b> sent within each isochronous interval <b>142</b> are each calculated based on data packets sent at least two isochronous intervals previous to the sending of the corresponding supplemental packet <b>140</b>. Specifically, as shown, supplemental data packet <b>140</b>F is labelled with an &#x201c;R&#x201d; signifying that the payload within that supplemental packet is identical to the payload within supplemental packet <b>140</b>A and that the error correcting code within these packets are calculated based on the data within packets <b>138</b>A and <b>138</b>B. As such, the post transmission of this payload occurs two isochronous intervals in the future with respect to the data packets used to calculate the error code contained within it. Additionally, in a pretransmission example, as one or more data packets <b>138</b> and one or more supplemental packets <b>140</b> have been received prior to a future data packet <b>138</b> from which the supplemental packet <b>140</b> was calculated, the present methods provide for methods of creating, in advance of receipt, the future packet <b>138</b> based on the first data packet received and the supplemental packet <b>140</b> from which it was calculated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">This example pre and post transmission configuration is advantageous in situations where packet loss is common or at the end of a particular link budget for the wireless connections described herein. For example, should the give connections experience interference within a particular isochronous interval, both the data packets <b>138</b> and the supplemental packets <b>140</b> able to aid in recovery of those data packets may be lost. By providing a post transmission several isochronous intervals in the future, there is an increased possibility that the interference that caused the initial packet loss is resolved and, given a large enough buffer, all packets originally lost may be recoverable. For example, as shown, should interference or other factors cause data packet <b>138</b>A and supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B to be lost or missed, the post transmission packet <b>140</b>F which contains the same payload as lost packet <b>140</b>A will be sent at a different time in the future, where the interference has likely been resolved, and the post transmitted supplemental data can be used along with packet <b>138</b>B to recover lost packet <b>138</b>A.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, packet recovery using the methods described herein can be iterative. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, should interference or other environmental factors cause packets <b>138</b>A, <b>138</b>B, and <b>140</b>A to be lost, the systems and methods described herein can begin with the recovery of packet <b>138</b>B by using data from received packet <b>138</b>C and received supplemental packet <b>140</b>C. Once packet <b>138</b>B is recovered, the system <b>100</b> can use recovered packet <b>138</b>B and post transmission packet <b>140</b>F to recover first packet <b>138</b>A.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As mentioned above, it should be appreciated that the broadcast streams described in the present disclosure can utilize encryption to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the error correction and enhancement capabilities described herein. For example, source controller <b>106</b> can take the encoded data that will be sent via the broadcast isochronous stream associated with the supplemental packets <b>140</b> and encrypt each packet prior to broadcasting. The respective key of the key pair used to encrypt the data can be sent to an authorized sink device <b>104</b> prior to initiating the stream such that the sink controller <b>118</b> of an authorized device can decrypt the decoded data provided in the supplemental stream. In this way, for non-authorized users or non-authorized devices, the data associated with the first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A will still be available, but the increased robustness created by the use of error correcting code and/or the increased quality of sending additional audio data within the supplemental packets <b>140</b> will not be available. In other words, in this example, the broadcast stream data associated with data packets <b>138</b> would not be encrypted while the broadcast stream data associated with with supplemental data packets <b>140</b> would be encrypted. In another example, both the broadcast stream data associated with data packets <b>138</b> and the broadcast stream data associated with with supplemental data packets <b>140</b> would be encrypted. For example, the broadcast stream associated with data packets <b>138</b> can utilize a first encryption key pair KP1 (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) while the broadcast stream associated with supplemental packets <b>140</b> would utilize a second encryption key pair KP2 different than the first encryption key pair KP1. In this way, for non-authorized users or non-authorized devices, the data associated with the first broadcast isochronous stream <b>136</b>A will be available as long as the user or device has access to the respective key of the first encryption key pair KP1 used to decrypt the data associated with data packets <b>138</b>, but the increased robustness created by the use of error correcting code and/or the increased quality of sending additional audio data within the supplemental packets <b>140</b> will only be available if the user or device has access to the respective key of the second encryption key pair KP2 used to decrypt the data associated with the supplemental data packets <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, it should be appreciated that, although illustrated as separate streams, the data packets <b>138</b> and the supplemental packets <b>140</b> described herein, can be sent within the same isochronous stream. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, for example, within the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A, packet <b>138</b>A and its respective retransmitted packets can be sent. Immediately following the last retransmitted packet and within the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A, the system <b>100</b> can send supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B. The supplemental packets <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B will be temporally shifted with respect to packet <b>138</b>A and the respective retransmitted packets so that a single radio, e.g., source radio <b>116</b>, can be used to send all packets. It should be appreciated that in this example, packet headers will likely be required to instruct the sink controllers <b>118</b> of each sink device <b>104</b> on the type of data being sent in each packet of the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A. Furthermore, the examples provided herein describe using data contained in one or more supplemental packets, sent via a second broadcast isochronous stream, to recover, re-create, or enhance the data sent via a first broadcast isochronous stream. It should be appreciated that each packet <b>138</b> (or packets <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>) can include multiple frames of audio data. As such, the error correction code and/or the additional data provided in the supplemental packets <b>140</b> can be calculated based on or applied to individual frames of data rather than each packet in their entirety. In other words, the one or more supplemental data packets <b>140</b> are used to re-create and/or enhance at least a portion (one or more frames) of one or more data packets <b>138</b> (or packets <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>) of the plurality of data packets.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although the descriptions above provide multiple broadcast isochronous streams, it should be appreciated that a similar concept can be employed on a non-broadcast system, e.g., using connected isochronous streams between the source device <b>102</b> and each sink device <b>104</b>. If applied in a non-broadcast scenario, e.g., with connected isochronous streams, the system can include an additional interface to the source controller <b>106</b> to indicate which packets need to be acknowledged by the source controller <b>106</b> but not spend time on reception. In the non-broadcast examples, the systems described herein include acknowledging the successful recovery or recreation of one or more of the plurality of data packets <b>138</b>. Thus, the systems described make it possible to re-create a packet that the sink devices <b>104</b> had difficulties receiving and sends an acknowledgement of the successfully recovery of that packet so that the system can continue to the transmission of the next packet the sink device needs.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the simplicity of implementation of the system and methods described herein. For example, a benefit of the configurations disclosed herein is that it does not require any changes to the Bluetooth Radio or Controller's currently used by source and sink devices for audio transmission. For example, the implementations described herein can be implemented by creation of an interface between the Isochronous Adaptation Layer (ISOAL) and the traditional LC3 encoder/decoder and I2S serial bus interface of typical audio source and sink devices. This interface is represented by a rectangle labelled &#x201c;Hook&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Additionally, when a packet is being calculated in advance the present system can utilize this interface to indicate to the source controller <b>106</b> which packets of the first isochronous stream <b>136</b>A to pick up in advance. The same interface will be needed when the error correcting code is post transmitted and not needed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the steps of an exemplary method <b>200</b> according to the present disclosure. Method <b>200</b> includes, for example: transmitting an isochronous stream <b>136</b>A, the isochronous stream including a plurality of data packets <b>138</b> (or <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>) sent within a first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A or using a first frequency <b>144</b> (step <b>202</b>); and transmitting one or more supplemental data packets <b>140</b> within the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A and temporally shifted with respect to the plurality of data packets <b>138</b> (or <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>) or at a second frequency <b>146</b> different that the first frequency <b>144</b> (step <b>204</b>); wherein the one or more supplemental data packets <b>140</b> are used to re-create and/or enhance at least a portion of one or more data packets <b>138</b> of the plurality of data packets <b>138</b> that were received during the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A, or wherein the one or more supplemental data packets <b>140</b> are used to create and/or enhance at least a portion of the one or more data packets of the plurality of data packets <b>138</b> that will be received during the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A or during a second isochronous interval <b>142</b>B after the first isochronous interval <b>142</b>A. Optionally, method <b>200</b> can also include acknowledging a successful receipt of the one or more supplemental data packets <b>140</b> (step <b>206</b>).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be understood to control over dictionary definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The phrase &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean &#x201c;either or both&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases.
