The present application further relates to a method for manufacturing a super junction device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A super junction structure is a structure consisting of alternately arranged N-type pillars and P-type pillars, i.e., P-N pillars. If the super junction structure is used to replace the N-type drift region in the Vertical Double-diffused Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (VDMOS) device, an on path is provided in an on state (only the N-type pillars provide the path, the P-type pillars do not provide), and reverse bias voltage is borne in an off state (the P-N pillars bear together), a super junction Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is formed. The super junction MOSFET can greatly reduce the on resistance of the device by using an epitaxial layer with low resistivity when the reverse breakdown voltage is consistent with that of the traditional VDMOS device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By forming trenches in the N-type epitaxial layer and filling the P-type epitaxial layer in the trenches to form alternately arranged P-N pillars, it is a method capable of manufacturing super junctions in batches.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If it is necessary to manufacture devices with higher reverse bias breakdown voltage or devices with lower specific on resistance, the pitch of P-N pillars needs to be smaller, or the P-N depth of the devices needs to be increased. When using the process of trench filling P-type epitaxy, the above requirements will cause the following problems. Firstly, the height-width ratio of P-type trenches is too high, causing a problem to the etching of trenches. Especially after etching, the etching residue at the bottom of the trenches cannot be cleaned, resulting in device failure; Secondly, the height-width ratio of P-type trenches is too large, making the epitaxial filling of the devices more difficult, resulting in epitaxial holes or long epitaxial filling time, and thus increasing the manufacturing cost. Therefore, in these cases, one method is to divide the formation of P-type pillars into multiple times or twice, reduce the height-width ratio of P-type pillars each time, so that the etching, cleaning and filling process of trenches can be realized and has cost advantages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the existing technical solutions, high concentration is adopted (for example, a substrate with resistivity of 0.001-0.003 &#x3a9;&#xb7;cm and even lower resistivity is adopted to reduce Rdson), which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the resistivity of 0.5-5 &#x3a9;&#xb7;cm of the N-type epitaxial layer deposited thereon. Therefore, in this process, the outdiffusion of substrate impurities will influence the uniformity of device performance. In order to reduce the outdiffusion, the high-concentration substrate needs to adopt back protection through an oxide film and a polysilicon film, which increases the cost. At the same time, since the wafer edge part of the high-concentration substrate (assuming that the back has been protected) is exposed in the process, special management shall be carried out in cleaning and other processes. For example, the high-concentration substrate is treated only before the liquid change of the cleaning solution, which reduces the production efficiency, or the liquid change is required to be carried out immediately after the high-concentration substrate is cleaned for other processes, which increases the cost.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, as the P-N contact surface of the trench filled super junction MOSFET is completely smooth, unlike the super junction MOSFET formed through times of epitaxy, the part after the P-N pillars is formed through ion implantation after annealing diffusion, and the ion concentration distribution cannot be completely uniform. Therefore, there is always local charge imbalance at the P-N contact interface. The local charge imbalance improves the reverse recovery softness of the body diode. Therefore, the softness of the body diode of the existing trench filled super junction MOSFET is not as good as that of the device formed through times of epitaxy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The technical problem to be solved by the present application is to provide a super junction device, which can eliminate the adverse effect of impurity outdiffusion of the high-concentration substrate, so that the super junction structure can realize an ultra-low specific-on-resistance structure, ensure good ohmic contact on the back, and improve the characteristics of the body diode of the device.

The N-type redundant epitaxial layer can increase the process window of the back thinning process, so that the N-type semiconductor substrate can be completely removed without influencing the N-type buffer layer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present application further configures the doping concentration relationships between the N-type redundant epitaxial layer and the N-type semiconductor substrate, and between the N-type redundant epitaxial layer and the N-type buffer layer, that is, it can avoid the adverse effect caused by the excessive doping concentration of the N-type redundant epitaxial layer, for example, the fluctuation in the resistivity of the epitaxial layer in a transition region. At the same time, it can also form a drain region with high doping concentration in combination with back N-type ion implantation, form a good ohmic contact with the back metal layer, reduce the ratio of back contact resistance to the whole on resistance to less than 1%.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since the present application does not need to use a high-concentration N-type semiconductor substrate, it can perform a photolithography process to local P-type impurity implantation on the back, that is, form the back P-type impurity region, thus changing the carrier distribution of the device when the body diode is on, especially increasing the carriers from the P-N pillars, that is, the super junction structure to the drain region. Since these carriers are not in the P-N pillars, in the reverse recovery process, the carriers are not depleted when the P-N pillars experience depletion and complete depletion, and are pulled away with the further increase of Vds, finally increasing the reverse recovery time and thus improving the reverse recovery softness of the body diode. Therefore, the present application improves the characteristics of the body diode of the device, including the reverse recovery peak current (Irrm) and the reverse recovery softness.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present application will be further described below in detail with reference to the drawings and in combination with the specific embodiments.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a structure of a super junction device according to an embodiment of the present application.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrate schematic diagrams of device structures in steps of a method for manufacturing a super junction device according to an embodiment of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it illustrates a schematic diagram of a structure of a super junction device according to an embodiment of the present application.
