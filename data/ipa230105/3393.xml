The cooking chamber <b>1</b> may include a cooking space <b>13</b> in which foods may be cooked by being toasted. The toaster oven <b>100</b> may further include a housing <b>61</b> that accommodates the cooking chamber <b>1</b>, a front door (not shown), and at least one food rack (not shown). An air inlet <b>110</b> and an air outlet <b>120</b> are further provided, and the air passage <b>2</b> transports air from the air inlet to the air outlet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cooking chamber <b>1</b> may include at least one side wall <b>11</b> and a top wall <b>12</b>. The side wall <b>11</b> may be provided with an air inlet <b>110</b> in communication with the cooking space <b>13</b> of the cooking chamber <b>1</b>. In a non-limiting example, the air inlet <b>110</b> may be disposed in a bottom half area of the side wall <b>11</b>, more particularly only in the bottom half area of the side wall <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The top wall <b>12</b> may be provided with an air outlet <b>120</b> in communication with the cooking space <b>13</b> of the cooking chamber <b>1</b>. In the illustrated example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the air outlet <b>120</b> may include a plurality of air outlet holes <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>. The air outlet holes <b>121</b> may be spaced apart from each other in a horizontal direction, and the air outlet holes <b>122</b> may be spaced apart from each other in the horizontal direction. The air outlet holes <b>121</b> may be arranged such that length of air outlet holes <b>121</b> are increased as the air outlet holes <b>121</b> are distant from the side wall <b>11</b>. Similarly, the air outlet holes <b>122</b> may be arranged such that length of air outlet holes <b>122</b> are increased as the air outlet holes <b>122</b> are distant from the side wall <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the embodiment shown provides the air inlet <b>110</b> in the side wall <b>11</b> and the air outlet <b>120</b> in a top wall <b>12</b>, it will be understood that the air inlet and outlet may be provided on any internal surface of the toaster oven. Accordingly, the inlet may be on a bottom surface of the toaster oven. However, as discussed below, the air inlet <b>110</b> is typically located such that it is spaced apart from the air outlet <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The air passage <b>2</b> may be disposed outside the cooking chamber <b>1</b>. The air passage <b>2</b> may communicate with the air inlet <b>110</b> and with the air outlet <b>120</b>. In this embodiment, the air passage <b>2</b> may include a side air passage part <b>21</b> and a top air passage part <b>22</b>. The side air passage part <b>21</b> may be formed by the side wall <b>11</b> and a shroud <b>62</b>. The side wall <b>11</b> may be disposed between the cooking space <b>13</b> and the side air passage part <b>21</b>. The top air passage part <b>22</b> may communicate with the side air passage part <b>21</b>. The top air passage part <b>22</b> may be formed by the top wall <b>12</b> and a shroud <b>63</b>. The top wall <b>12</b> may be disposed between the cooking space <b>13</b> and the top air passage part <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the illustrated example, the top air passage part <b>22</b> may include two air paths <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> that are separated from each other by a part <b>125</b> of the top wall <b>12</b>. Each of the two air paths <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> may communicate with a part of the air outlet <b>120</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the air paths <b>221</b> may communicate with the air outlet holes <b>121</b>, and the air paths <b>222</b> may communicate with the air outlet holes <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fan <b>3</b> may blow air from the air inlet <b>110</b> to the air outlet <b>120</b> through the air passage <b>2</b>. Similarly, the fan <b>3</b> may be designed to suck air from the air inlet <b>110</b> such that the air flow in the cooking chamber <b>1</b> itself results in circulating air. The heating element <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be disposed in the upper portion of the cooking space <b>13</b>, and may extend in the horizontal direction. In addition, the air outlet <b>120</b> may extend over the heating element <b>4</b> in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there are three stages along the path of the airflow that determine the performance of the design of the toaster oven <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In operation of the toaster oven <b>100</b>, as designated by arrows A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the air in the cooking space <b>13</b> in the cooking chamber <b>1</b> may be pulled through the air inlet <b>110</b> by the fan <b>3</b>. As stated above, the air inlet <b>110</b> may be disposed in a bottom half area of the side wall <b>11</b>, more particularly only in the bottom half area of the side wall <b>11</b>. This configuration may allow the outlet air (as designated by arrows C), to flow down and permeate the cooking chamber <b>1</b> without prematurely being sucked into the fan <b>3</b>. In addition, according to the present configuration, the position of the air inlet <b>110</b> can force the air to be pulled through the cooking chamber <b>1</b>, particularly the middle and bottom sections at a higher pressure than would have been had the air inlet <b>110</b> been located elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As designated by arrows B, the fan <b>3</b> may accelerate the air that gets pulled from the cooking space <b>13</b> of the cooking chamber <b>1</b> into the side air passage part <b>21</b>. The air then flows up the side air passage part <b>21</b> and into the top air passage part <b>22</b>, which is a specifically designed duct (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), that splits the air into two paths <b>221</b> and <b>222</b> to even distribute the air over the heating element <b>4</b> along the width of the toaster oven's cooking chamber <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As designated by arrows C, the air may be ejected from the top air passage part <b>22</b> through the air outlet <b>120</b>. As discussed above, the air outlet <b>120</b> may extend over the heating element <b>4</b> in the horizontal direction. This configuration increases the possibility of evenly heating up all the air that exits from the air outlet <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure may allow an evenly distributed and evenly heated airflow to fill the cooking chamber of the toaster oven, for example, by the specific design of the fan shroud and duct (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the toaster oven may incorporate air frying features, such that a combination toaster oven and air fryer may be provided.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the present disclosure has been described at some length and with some particularity with respect to the several described embodiments, it is not intended that it should be limited to any such particulars or embodiments or any particular embodiment, but it is to be construed with references to the appended claims so as to provide the broadest possible interpretation of such claims in view of the prior art and, therefore, to effectively encompass the intended scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">All examples and conditional language recited herein are intended for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the disclosure and the concepts contributed by the inventor to furthering the art, and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.
