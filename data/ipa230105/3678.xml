id="p-0006" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an amperometric sensor for measuring free chlorine, which sensor comprises:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0003">an elongate body with a tip, wherein

is used to detect ions in a solution based on electric current or changes in electric current. To this end, the potential of the working electrode is maintained at a constant level with respect to the reference electrode by adjusting the current at the counter electrode. This is typically achieved by connecting the amperometric sensor to a potentiostat.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0007">In order to measure free chlorine, it is known, from for example US 20090014329, to maintain a potential of 0.2 V between the working electrode and the reference electrode. By measuring the current flowing through the working electrode a reliable indication for the amount of free chlorine is obtained.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">Due to the formation of deposits onto the counter and reference electrodes the sensitivity typically decreases over time. This can be slowed by periodically reversing the current, such that the deposits are loosened from the electrode surfaces. Another, complimentary option is to increase the surfaces of the electrodes. However, especially for the gold electrode surface of the reference electrode, this would be costly. Furthermore, even with the technique of reversing the current to clean the electrode surfaces, especially the gold electrode surface will still deteriorate gradually, such that the quality of the measurements will deteriorate over time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0009">Amperometric sensors for measuring free chlorine, and a combination of the amperometric sensor and a potentiostat are provided herein.

Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">It is desired to provide an amperometric sensor, which can be used for a prolonged time, without substantial deterioration of the sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">This object is achieved with an amperometric sensor as contemplated herein, which is exemplified in that the gold electrode surface is composed out of a string of electrically connected, spaced apart surface parts.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">When the amperometric sensor as contemplated herein is used for measuring free chlorine, a potential of 0.2 V is provided over the reference electrode and the working electrode. By applying a different potential, the amperometric sensor could also be used for measuring other ions, such as bromine. The potential decreases over the string of electrically connected, spaced apart surface parts of the gold electrode surface, such that basically only the first surface part of the electrode is used to contribute to the measurements of the amperometric sensor as contemplated herein. Only when the first surface part is deteriorated to a certain degree, the next surface part in the string will contribute to the measurements of the amperometric sensor. This allows for maintaining a good sensitivity of the sensor over a prolonged time, as there will still be a virtually new surface part be available for the measurements.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">An additional advantage found by the applicant is that the amperiometric sensor hardly influenced by the concentration of other chemicals, in particular cyanuric acid.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment of the amperometric sensor as contemplated herein the surface parts are identically shaped and dimensioned, preferably rectangular. Having identically shaped and dimensioned surface parts ensures that no substantial variations in the measurements occur, when the effective electrode surface shifts from a first surface part to the next surface part in the string.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">In a further preferred embodiment of the amperometric sensor as contemplated herein the gold electrode surface is provided as a layer arranged on a substrate by wafer production techniques, such as lithographic production techniques.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">By providing the gold electrode surface as a layer arranged on a substrate by wafer production techniques, i.e. on a chip, the production costs can be kept low as well as the material costs can be kept low. Using the wafer production techniques a small gold electrode surface can be provided with the required string of electrically connected, spaced apart surface parts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">An additional advantage is that by arranging the gold electrode surface on a chip, the chip can easily be mounted in the amperometric sensor and could also be exchanged easily, when the gold surface of all surface parts has deteriorated too much.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">Preferably, the counter electrode has a titanium electrode surface. Typically, stainless steel would be chosen for the counter electrode, as this is a low cost material, which allows for a large electrode surface. However, using the amperiometric sensor to measure free chlorine, will still result in that the stainless steel dissolves over time. By providing the counter electrode with a titanium electrode surface, this disadvantage is resolved and as result, the potentiostat connected to such an amperometric sensor as contemplated herein will need less calibration.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025">In a further embodiment of the amperometric sensor as contemplated herein the reference electrode is composed out of a sintered Ag/AgCl powder.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">The present disclosure further relates to a combination of an amperometric sensor as contemplated herein and a potentiostat connected to counter electrode, working electrode and reference electrode for maintaining the potential of the working electrode at a constant level with respect to the reference electrode by adjusting the current at the counter electrode.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">With the potentiostat it is ensured that the potential between the working electrode and reference electrode is constant, for measuring free chlorine typically 0.2 V. This allows for the current to be measured at the working electrode and to derive from the measured current a reference for the amount of free ions, such as free chlorine, in a solution.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment of the combination as contemplated herein the potentiostat comprises a control feature for maintaining the potential of the working electrode at a constant level with respect to the reference electrode, which control feature has a compensating feature, which measure the resistance between electrode surfaces of at least the working electrode and the reference electrode and compensate for the measured resistance.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">Measuring the resistance between the working electrode and reference electrode provides an indication for the conductivity of the solution, in which the free ions, such as free chlorine or bromine, is measured. This conductivity has a small influence on the accuracy of the measurements. By measuring the resistance, the potentiostat can compensate for this influence, such that the accuracy is further increased.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">Although measuring the resistance between the working electrode and reference electrode is preferred, it is also contemplated herein to provide a separate resistance sensor, typically embodied as two separate electrodes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">In yet another embodiment as contemplated herein the potentiostat further comprises a signal generator for adjusting the constant level according to a predefined signal pattern.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">By varying the constant level according a predefined signal pattern, the electrodes can be cleaned from any deposits, by reversing the current, but also different ions could be detected simultaneously, by measuring the current at the correct constant level. This allows for chlorine to be measured at the constant level of 0.2 V, while bromine can be measured at the constant level of 0.1 V.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an amperometric sensor <b>1</b> as contemplated herein.
