In some embodiments, high viscosity of therapeutic protein formulations is a particular challenge when the mode of administration is subcutaneous injection, which often calls for therapeutically effective concentrations of protein to be present in a small volume (&#x2dc;1 mL), at a viscosity that allows the formulations to flow easily through a relatively small orifice, such as that of a small gauge needle. Aspects of the disclosure relate to liquid formulations of Neublastin, and in particular liquid formulations that can be used for delivering small volumes of high concentration Neublastin, e.g., subcutaneously. Neublastin is a therapeutic protein used to treat neuropathic pain, which has a relatively low potency and poor subcutaneous bioavailability. Therefore, large doses of Neublastin are often called for to achieve desired therapeutic effects. However, conventional formulations containing succinate limit the solubility of Neublastin to 40 mg/mL under typical conditions, e.g., pH, temperature, etc. It has been found that at higher concentrations of Neublastin, the viscosity of the succinate formulations can become unacceptably high and therefore not compatible with certain modes of administration such as subcutaneous injection. Therefore, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to compositions comprising Neublastin and methods of manufacturing Neublastin with significantly improved solubility and decreased viscosity. It has been found that formulations of Neublastin containing citrate offer improved solubility and viscosity compared to the currently used succinate formulations. Accordingly, in one aspect, the disclosure relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising Neublastin and citrate. In some embodiments, a formulation has a viscosity suitable for subcutaneous injection. In some embodiments, a formulation has a viscosity suitable for injection through a needle in a range of 29 gauge to 31 gauge in size. In some embodiments, a formulation has a viscosity suitable for injection through a needle in a range of 29 gauge to 31 gauge in size while at a temperature in range of 40-60&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, a formulation has a viscosity of less than 35 cP at Neublastin concentrations of up to 150 mg/mL. In some embodiments, a formulation has a viscosity of up to about 20 cP at Neublastin concentrations of up to 135 mg/mL.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, Neublastin is at a concentration in a formulation of up to 150 mg/mL.

In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin citrate results in a Neublastin concentration of up to 135 mg/mL in the combination. In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin with citrate results in a Neublastin concentration of above 40 mg/mL to 150 mg/mL in the combination. In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin with citrate results in a citrate concentration of 50 mM to 150 mM in the combination. In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin with citrate results in a citrate concentration of 75 mM to 100 mM in the combination.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin with citrate results in the combination having a viscosity of up to 100 cP, for example 50-100 cP, around 50 cP, less than 50 cP, 40-50 cP, around 40 cP, less than 40 cP, 20-40 cP, or around 35 cP. In some embodiments, the step of combining Neublastin with citrate results in the combination having a viscosity of up to 20 cP.

Neublastin is a neurotrophin, or neuronal growth factor, and is classified as a glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand family. In some embodiments, Neublastin acts specifically on sensory neurons, promoting their survival and regrowth. Therefore, in some aspects, Neublastin may be useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Aspects of the disclosure relate to liquid formulations of Neublastin that can support relatively high concentrations of Neublastin in a form that is acceptable for low volume delivery to a subject, e.g., via subcutaneous administration. Neublastin has a relatively low potency and poor subcutaneous bioavailability, and consequently, a large dose (&#x3e;100 mg) is required to achieve a therapeutic effect. An additional challenge with Neublastin is the very high viscosity of the protein compared to other molecules. As Neublastin is intended to treat chronic pain, a treatment modality based on regular patient self-administration via subcutaneous injection is highly desirable. For subcutaneous dosing to be considered viable for self-administration, the injection volume should be no more than about 2 mL, e.g., 1-2 mL, about 1 mL or less than 1 mL), and the viscosity must be low enough for the solution to flow easily through a fine gauge needle without requiring an excessively high force. In some cases, high viscosity is the single limiting factor preventing a therapeutically effective molecule from being a therapeutically viable product.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The viscosity of Neublastin becomes unacceptably high at concentrations greater than about 40 mg/mL in succinate and other formulations tested. Consequently, current formulation technology limits NBN to &#x2dc;40 mg/mL concentration in the final drug product which significantly limits the amount that can be administered as a bolus injection in the subcutaneous (SC) space.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Pharmaceutical Formulations and Methods of Manufacture</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some aspects, the present disclosure relates to the surprising discovery that formulations of Neublastin comprising citrate, e.g., as a buffering agent, offer improved solubility and viscosity compared to the currently used succinate-based formulations. As used herein, the term &#x201c;citrate&#x201d; refers to a derivative of citric acid found in solution. In some embodiments, citrate is a salt, ester, and/or a polyatomic anion. In some embodiments, citrate is provided with a sodium adduct, such as in the form of trisodium citrate. In some embodiments, citrate is provided in solution at an appropriate pH, e.g., a pH in a range of 3.0 to 6.2, by combining citric acid monohydrate with trisodium citrate dihydrate in solution. In some embodiments, citrate is provided in solution at an appropriate pH, e.g., a pH in a range of 2.6 to 7.6, by combining citric acid and Na2HPO4 in solution. Other suitable sources of citrate may be used, including any suitable monobasic, dibasic, or tribasic form. In some embodiments of formulations described herein, citrate is present at a concentration ranging from 1 mM to 200 mM, 10 mM to 175 mM, 50 mM to 150 mM, or 75 mM to 100 mM. In some embodiments, citrate is present at a concentration of about 75 mM, 80 mM, 85 mM, 90 mM, 95 mM or 100 to mM.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, in some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations or compositions disclosed herein include a buffer, e.g., a citrate buffer. As used herein, the term &#x201c;buffer&#x201d; refers to a pH-controlled medium. In some embodiments, a buffer can be used to dissolve an active pharmaceutical ingredient, e.g., a therapeutic protein, such as Neublastin, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and excipients, or as a diluent to dissolve liquid pharmaceutical compounds and compositions. Buffers neutralize amounts of acid or base present within a solution and, in doing so, maintain a stable pH of the solution within a particular range. In some embodiments, the buffering capacity of a buffer is in a range of pH 3.0 to pH 8.0, pH 4.0 to pH 6.0, or pH 5.0 to pH 7.0. In some embodiments, the buffering capacity of a buffer is about pH 4.0, about pH 4.5, about pH 5.0, about pH 5.5, about pH 6.0 or about pH 6.5.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to a protein therapeutic, e.g. Neublastin, that is dissolved in a buffer having a pH that is above or below the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein therapeutic. As used herein, the term &#x201c;isoelectric point&#x201d; refers to the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical surface charge. At a pH below their pI, proteins carry a net positive surface charge. At a pH above their pI, proteins carry a net negative surface charge. The surface charge of a protein affects its solubility by increasing or decreasing the amount of interaction that protein has with surrounding molecules, e.g. solvent molecules such as water and/or other protein molecules in solution. In some embodiments, the disclosure relates to the discovery that the charged nature of certain proteins, for example, Neublastin, in the context of their pI, make them more viscous and less soluble in pharmaceutical formulations. In some embodiments, the instant disclosure provides a solution to these issues in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising Neublastin and citrate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some aspects, the present disclosure provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising Neublastin and citrate that have improved viscosity compared to other formulations, e.g., succinate, of Neublastin. As used herein, the term &#x201c;viscosity&#x201d; refers to a measure of fluids resistance to deformation, e.g., by a shear force or tensile force. Viscosity is often measured by a viscometer and expressed in centipoise (cP) units. In some embodiments, fluids having relative high viscosity display higher resistance to shear forces, e.g., are &#x201c;thicker&#x201d;, and thus under a particular force will flow more slowly than fluid having relatively low viscosity. It should be appreciated that the viscosity of a liquid formulation can be measured using any suitable technique including using a rheometer, a viscometer, e.g., a capillary viscometer or microcapillary viscometer, or any other suitable device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, order for a pharmaceutical formulation to be useful for subcutaneous injection, its viscosity must be low enough for the solution to flow easily through a needle or other similar conduit or orifice without requiring an excessively high force.

The increased solubility of Neublastin in the formulations described herein allows for therapeutically effective amounts of Neublastin to be delivered in a reduced volume compared to conventional, e.g., succinate formulations.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;therapeutically effective&#x201d; refers to the amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, e.g., Neublastin, required to prevent, treat or reduce symptoms associated with a particular disease or disorder (for example, neuropathic pain). A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic protein, such as Neublastin, may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the protein to elicit a desired response in the individual, e.g., amelioration of at least one disorder parameter or amelioration of at least one symptom of the disorder. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the protein are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. Thus, in some embodiments of formulations described herein, Neublastin is present at a concentration in a range of 10 mg/mL to 300 mg/mL.

This example describes how the present disclosure overcomes the challenges of delivering therapeutically relevant doses of Neublastin via subcutaneous injection.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The formulation of Neublastin currently in clinical use comprises Neublastin, sodium succinate, L-Arginine/HCl and NaCl at a pH of 5.5 (referred to herein as the &#x201c;succinate formulation&#x201d;). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the succinate formulation displays exceptional thermal stability across a range of temperatures. However, the succinate formulation of Neublastin also has unfavorable colloidal stability (as measured by diffusion interaction parameter; 1(D) and poor solubility (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), making the delivery of pharmaceutically effective doses a challenge. This is because Neublastin has low potency and poor bioavailability in the subcutaneous space, meaning that a large dose of Neublastin is required to exert a therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the succinate formulation of Neublastin achieves a maximum solubility of 7.4 mg/mL at a pH of 5.5.

Neublastin carries a high charge at pH 5.5, as indicated by the high isoelectric point (pI) of the protein, which is generally about 11. The charge distribution of the protein may results in dipole-dipole interaction and/or other interactions that confer a high viscosity on the formulation.

The improvement in viscosity was observed over a range of temperatures, including after a freeze-thaw cycle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Accordingly, it is believed that in some embodiments, citrate may disrupts intermolecular interaction involving, e.g., protein-protein interactions, for example, as may be caused by dipole-dipole interactions, charged Neublastin. Thus, the data indicate that the improved solubility as a result of Neublastin formulation with citrate correlates with significantly minimized viscosity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000">Formulations of Neublastin with Succinate Formulation were Found to be Good Candidates for Future Use</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">During the above discussed clinical trials, it was discovered that succinate formulations having small amounts of Neublastin were viable candidates for future drug development. In particular, a formulation comprising 1.6 mg/ml Neublastin in 10 mM of sodium succinate, 75 mM of NaCl and 100 mM L-Arginine demonstrated promise. A pH of 5.5 was maintained.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">EQUIVALENTS</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0069">While several inventive embodiments have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and/or structures for performing the function and/or obtaining the results and/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the inventive embodiments described herein.
