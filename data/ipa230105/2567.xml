reformations are conducted in accordance with desired properties of molded products such as impact resistance and moldability. Methods for improving the impact resistance desired for molded products include methods of adjusting the types of polyamide resins and methods of melt kneading a polyamide resin and a different kind polymer. Methods for improving the moldability include methods of adjusting the melt viscosity by adding a modifier such as layer silicate or ionomer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When molding a thick molded body, so-called thick material, by blow molding, injection molding or the like, it is desired that the melt viscosity is adjusted. Since polyamide resins generally have low melt viscosity, drawdown of the parison during blow molding, which leads to lower moldability, becomes an issue. To deal with this matter, methods for reducing the occurrence of drawdown by increasing the viscosity in the low shear region using modifiers are being explored. Further, in injection molding, inflow of the molten resin into the spaces of the mold may cause development of burrs on the molded products. To reduce the burrs, methods have been being explored that increase the viscosity in the low shear region during the cooling solidification while avoiding excessive thickening in the high shear region during the injection filling.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a method for reforming a polyamide resin in blow molding, for example, Patent Document 1 discloses a polyamide resin composition in which a polyamide 6 resin and a polyamide 610 resin are mixed at a certain ratio to improve the melt tension, with an ionomer and an ethylene-based elastomer being further blended, in an endeavor to improve moldability and low-temperature toughness in blow molding.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2007-204674</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0006">As described above, especially in the molding methods such as blow molding and injection molding, it is desired that polyamide resin compositions have suitable melt viscosity and favorable moldability.

The reason is not clear, but it is presumed as follows.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0026">When the ionomer (A) is added to the polyamide resin (C), the melt viscosity in a low shear region can be increased. This is because a sea portion (that is, the polyamide resin (C) portion) and an island portion (that is, the ionomer (A) portion) interact in the sea-island structure in which the ionomer (A) is dispersed in the polyamide resin (C). The thickening action in the low shear region is more effective as the dispersibility of the ionomer (A) is higher. It is believed that the thickening action in the low shear region is more effective as the dispersibility of the ionomer (A) is higher. For example, the dispersibility of the ionomer (A) can be adjusted by adjusting the acid content or the amount of metal ions of the ionomer (A), and in particular, by increasing the acid content, the dispersibility tends to increase and the thickening effect tends to increase. However, since the ionomer (A) is generally inferior in oil resistance to the polyamide resin (C), the oil resistance when the resin composition is used for a molded product tends to be decrease by adding the ionomer (A) to the polyamide resin (C).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0027">In the method of manufacturing a resin composition of the present disclosure, chemically crosslinking the ionomer (A) by using the organic peroxide (B), and adding the chemically crosslinked ionomer (A) to the polyamide resin (C) to manufacture the resin composition. It is presumed that, by chemically crosslinking the ionomer (A) in advance in this way, the thickening effect of the polyamide resin (C) by the ionomer (A) is improved, and the oil resistance when the resin composition is used for a molded product can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0028">The method of manufacturing a resin composition of the present disclosure include the step of chemically crosslinking the ionomer (A) in the presence of the organic peroxide (B).
