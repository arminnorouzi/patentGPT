A transient voltage spike is a brief increase in voltage through the device. The spike in voltage can range from a few millivolts to thousands of volts. These events may be caused by noise in the power supply such as from inductive ringing from an electric motor or poorly designed power converters, bad connections or wiring causing arcing, or by natural electric events such as electrostatic discharge. These transient events can damage sensitive device components such as capacitors and resistors causing failure or improper device functionality.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To protect against transients various components have been used to shunt the voltage spikes away from the sensitive parts of devices. Components used to protect against transients include decoupling capacitors, Zener diodes, avalanche diodes, metal oxide varistors, poly switches and transient voltage suppressor diodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transient voltage suppressor diodes (TVS) offer many benefits over the other components used to protect against transients. Particularly, transient voltage suppressor diodes are fast acting, good for moderate frequency applications, can be both uni-direction and bidirectional, have a low clamping voltage and fail safely into a closed circuit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Past designs for transient voltage suppressor diodes had high capacitances and large device packages owing to non-optimal interconnections between portions of the transient voltage suppressor diodes. Thus, aspects of the present disclosure have been developed to address these needs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The teachings of the present disclosure can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a TVS protection device according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a top view depicting a pair of fingers in a single channel of the improved TVS including two types of overlapping fingers arranged laterally along a major surface of an epitaxial layer according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a cut-away three-dimensional perspective view of an improved a single channel of the TVS device according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts a top view of the improved multichannel bi-directional or uni-directional TVS device without the insulating layer according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows another implementation of the improved multichannel bi-directional or uni-directional TVS device without the insulating layer according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a top down view of another implementation of the improved multichannel bi-directional or uni-directional TVS device without the insulating layer according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a top down view of the improved multichannel bi-directional or unidirectional TVS device without the insulating and with a portion of the second metal layer outlined.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a top down view of another implementation of the improved multichannel bi-directional or unidirectional TVS device without the insulating layer and with a portion of the second metal layer outlined.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a cut away side view of an alternative implementation of the improved a single channel of the TVS device according to aspects of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the following detailed description contains many specific details for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments of the invention described below are set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the claimed invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;back,&#x201d; &#x201c;leading,&#x201d; &#x201c;trailing,&#x201d; etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that in the development of any such implementations, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosure herein refers silicon doped with ions of a first conductivity type or a second conductivity. The ions of the first conductivity type may be opposite ions of a second conductivity type. For example, ions of the first conductivity type may be n-type, which create charge carriers when doped into silicon. Ions of the first conductivity type include phosphorus, antimony, bismuth, lithium and arsenic. Ions of the second conductivity may be p-type, which create holes for charge carriers when doped into silicon and in this way are referred to as being the opposite of n-type. P-type type ions include boron, aluminum, gallium and indium. While the above description referred to n-type as the first conductivity type and p-type as the second conductivity the disclosure is not so limited, p-type may be the first conductivity and n-type may be second the conductivity type.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. For convenience, use of + or &#x2212; after a designation of conductivity or net impurity carrier type (p or n) refers generally to a relative degree of concentration of designated type of net impurity carriers within a semiconductor material. In general, terms, an n+ material has a higher n type net dopant (e.g., electron) concentration than an n material, and an n material has a higher carrier concentration than an n&#x2212; material. Similarly, a p+ material has a higher p type net dopant (e.g., hole) concentration than a p material, and a p material has a higher concentration than a p&#x2212; material. It is noted that what is relevant is the net concentration of the carriers, not necessarily dopants. For example, a material may be heavily doped with n-type dopants but still have a relatively low net carrier concentration if the material is also sufficiently counter-doped with p-type dopants. As used herein, a concentration of dopants less than about 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>may be regarded as &#x201c;lightly doped&#x201d; and a concentration of dopants greater than about 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>may be regarded as &#x201c;heavily doped&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Operation of a TVS device depicted may be appreciated by referring to the equivalent circuit diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The TVS device includes a P-N junction diode DL<b>1</b> connected in a forward direction between a protected node (I/O terminal) and ground potential. That is, the anode of the diode DL<b>1</b> is connected to the ground node and the cathode of the diode DL<b>1</b> is connected to the protected node. Diode DL<b>1</b> functions as the low-side steering diode of the TVS protection device. The TVS device includes the SCR device connected in parallel with the P-N junction diode DL<b>1</b>. In particular, the SCR device can be represented as two back-to-back connected PNP and NPN bipolar transistors. The anode of the SCR device is the P-type emitter of the PNP bipolar transistor which is also connected to the N-type base through the base resistance RNW. The cathode of the SCR device is the N-type emitter of the NPN bipolar transistor which is connected to ground potential and to the N-type base of the NPN bipolar transistor through the base resistance RPW. As thus configured, contributions to the parasitic capacitance of the TVS device at the protected node (I/O terminal) are mainly from the N-type region of the P-N junction diode DL<b>1</b> and the anode of the SCR device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to aspects of the present disclosure, a transient voltage suppressing device may include a semiconductor epitaxial layer on a surface of a semiconductor substrate having a light concentration of ions of a first conductivity type that is opposite a second conductivity type. A plurality of semiconductor fingers may be arranged laterally along a major surface of the epitaxial layer. The semiconductor fingers may include first type fingers and second type fingers. The first and second types of fingers may include a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) portion and a junction diode portion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first type of finger includes a first metal layer that conductively couples the SCR portion to the junction diode portion wherein the first metal couples the plurality of fingers of the first type together. The plurality of fingers of the second type are coupled together by a second metal layer that is electrically insulated from the first metal layer and over top first metal layer. A junction diode is formed between the junction diode portion of the first type of finger and the junction portion of the second type of finger. An SCR is formed between the SCR portion of the first type of finger and the SCR portion of the second type of finger. The SCR portion of the first type of finger and the SCR portion of the second type of finger may be located proximal to each other in the epitaxial layer. Additionally, the junction diode portion of the first type of finger and the junction diode portion of the second type of finger maybe located proximal to each other in the epitaxial layer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first type of finger may include an SCR cathode region that acts as the cathode for the SCR formed between the SCR portion of the first type of finger and the SCR portion of the second type of finger and wherein the second type of finger may include an SCR anode region that acts as an anode for said SCR. In a bi-directional device, the first type of fingers may be electrically coupled to a reference node and the second type of fingers may be electrically coupled to a protected node. In a uni-directional device, the first metal layer may be conductively coupled to a ground plane. The fingers of the first type may include a first well region lightly doped with the first conductivity type formed in the epitaxial layer, wherein the SCR portion for fingers of the first type may further include a SCR collector region heavily doped with ions of the second conductivity type in the first well region and a first SCR well contact region. The fingers of the second type may include a second well region lightly doped with the second conductivity type formed in the epitaxial layer, wherein the SCR portion for fingers of the second type may further include an SCR emitter region heavily doped with ions of the first conductivity type in the second well region and a second SCR well contact region. The junction diode portion of the first type of finger may include a junction anode region heavily doped with ions of the first conductivity type. The junction diode region of the second type of finger may include a junction diode cathode region heavily doped with ions of the second conductivity type. The TVS device may further include an insulating layer that insulates the first metal from the epitaxial layer and the second metal and wherein vias through the insulating layer electrically couple the first metal to the corresponding SRC region and the junction diode regions and the second metal to the corresponding SCR region and the junction diode region.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The SCR portion of the fingers of the first type may include an SCR collector region heavily doped with ions of the second conductivity type and an first SCR well contact region formed in a first well region of the epitaxial layer doped with ions of the first conductivity type. The SCR portion of fingers of the second type may include an SCR emitter region heavily doped with ions of the first conductivity type formed in a second well region of the epitaxial layer doped with ions of the second conductivity type. The SCR portion of the first type of finger and the SCR portion of the second type of finger are located proximal to the each other in the epitaxial layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An Input/Output (I/O) contact pad may be coupled to the top side of the second metal layer, wherein the first metal layer is underneath the second metal layer. The I/O contact pad may be a wire bonded to the topside of the second metal layer. The second metal layer may be thicker than the first metal layer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The second metal layer for each of the fingers of the second type may be interrupted over the first metal layer. The interrupted second metal layer of each of the fingers of the second type may include a contact pad. The contact pad of each for each of the fingers of the second type may be conductively coupled to form a single channel. This so-called &#x201c;pad-on-top&#x201d; configuration allows freedom to engineer the finger geometry and allow the first metal layer to extend all the way across a die. This allows for longer fingers, which can carry higher current and reduce voltage. By way of contrast, a conventional configuration uses a bus on top to connect the grounds. In such a configuration fingers get smaller and finger length is limited. Parasitic capacitance therefore adds up due to the bus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a top view depicting a pair of fingers in a single channel of the improved TVS including two types of overlapping fingers arranged laterally along a first direction on a major surface of an epitaxial layer <b>101</b> according to aspects of the present disclosure. The epitaxial layer <b>101</b> may be lightly doped with ions of a first conductivity type for example and without limitation, the epitaxial layer may be doped with p-type ions. A first type of finger may include a Silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) portion <b>121</b> and a junction diode portion <b>122</b>. The SCR portion <b>121</b> may include a collector and well contact of an SCR formed in the epitaxial layer between the SCR portions of the first and second fingers.

The SCR collector region <b>102</b> and the first well contact region <b>104</b> may act as the SCR cathode region. For example the SCR collector region may be heavily doped with N type ions <b>103</b> next to a first SCR well contact region <b>104</b> heavily doped with P type ions <b>104</b> in the well region <b>102</b> that is more heavily doped with P-type ions than the epitaxial layer. The doping concentration of the first SCR well contact region <b>104</b> may be the same as the well region.

The SCR emitter region and the SCR well contact region <b>107</b> that act as an anode for the SCR formed in the epitaxial layer. For example and without limitation, the SCR emitter region <b>108</b> may be heavily doped with P type ions next to a second SCR well contact region <b>107</b> heavily doped with N type ions in the N-type well region <b>106</b>. The doping concentration of the second SCR well contact region <b>107</b> may be the same as the well region <b>106</b> and the second SCR well contact region may simply be a portion of the well region. This SCR portion <b>123</b> may form the anode for the SCR created in the epitaxial between the SCR regions of the first and second types of fingers. As shown, the SCR region <b>123</b> of the second finger type is located proximal to the SCR region of the first type of finger <b>121</b> this allows for a reduced capacitance and easier tuning. Note that in the implementation shown, the second well region <b>106</b> includes two SCR emitter regions <b>108</b> and the first well region <b>102</b> includes two SCR collector regions <b>103</b> to allow striping laterally along the major access of the epitaxial layer and reduce wasted space.

As shown the second type of finger may also be conductively coupled to an I/O or active portion of the device to be protected. During normal operation the TVS device acts in blocking mode preventing current from traveling to the ground connection but when a transient voltage spike occurs at the I/O the device may regulate to allow current flow ground shunting the transient away from the device to be protected.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a three-dimensional perspective view of an improved a single channel of the TVS device according to aspects of the present disclosure.
