The GaN power devices are widely used in the industry due to advantages such as a high breakdown electric field, a high electron saturation velocity, and high electron mobility in a heterostructure. Currently, mainstream lateral GaN power devices are based on aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN/GaN heterojunction structures, implement operation in an enhancement mode (that is, a normally-off device, for which a threshold voltage is defined as Vth&#x3e;0) by introducing a special gate structure to deplete two-dimensional electron gas below a channel, and have been applied to power converters and related drive circuits. The special gate structure includes but is not limited to a P-type GaN gate structure (including a Schottky gate metal contact and an ohmic gate metal contact).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an enhanced lateral GaN power device based on the P-type GaN gate structure of the Schottky gate metal contact type. A source and a drain are connected to two-dimensional electron gas at an AlGaN/GaN interface by using ohmic metal. Gate metal is connected to P-type GaN and forms Schottky contact together with the P-type GaN. In a case, due to defects in a dielectric (SiO2, SiN, or the like) in the P-type GaN connected to a gate, at an AlGaN barrier layer, and on an AlGaN surface, or presence of residues from a manufacturing process, large gate leakage may occur in the device, which affects normal operation and long-term reliability of the device. To ensure reliability of devices, devices that operate abnormally or have reliability risks need to be screened out by using related tests. One of effective test methods is to apply a negative voltage to a gate (in this case, a source is grounded), observe a magnitude of a gate leakage current, and determine whether there is a reliability risk.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The enhanced GaN power device of the P-type GaN gate structure has a characteristic of a small gate capacitance, and a maximum withstand voltage of its gate is low (a direct current voltage is less than 6V for a long time, and a transient voltage is less than 10V). As a result, the device has comparatively poor resistance to an electrostatic discharge (electro-static discharge, ESD) event. Specifically, when a human body or a machine with static electricity comes in contact with a pin of the P-type enhanced GaN power device, an electrostatic discharge event occurs, and the static electricity of the charged body is discharged to the ground through the pin of the device. If an electrostatic discharge channel is not smooth or a capacitance of the device is small, the static electricity induces a comparatively high voltage on the device. When the induced voltage is higher than a withstand voltage between ends of the device, the device is burned. To improve an ESD capability of a GaN device, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a conventional gallium nitride-based ESD protection circuit, two ends of which are connected to a gate and a source of the power device separately. The ESD protection circuit mainly includes three parts: a clamp diode string <b>1</b>, a two-dimensional electron gas resistor <b>2</b>, and an ESD discharge low-voltage enhanced device <b>3</b>. A working principle thereof is as follows: When a gate of a P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b> undergoes a positive ESD event relative to a source, the clamp diode string <b>1</b> conducts, and a current conducted by the clamp diode string <b>1</b> forms a forward voltage drop on the two-dimensional electron-gas resistor <b>2</b>. When a voltage of the voltage drop is higher than a threshold voltage of the ESD discharge low-voltage enhanced device <b>3</b>, the ESD discharge low-voltage enhanced device <b>3</b> conducts, and positive ESD energy from the gate is released, to ensure that a gate voltage of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b> does not exceed a positive withstand voltage of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b>. When the gate of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b> undergoes a negative ESD event relative to the source, the ESD discharge low-voltage enhanced device <b>3</b> conducts reversely, and negative ESD energy from the gate is released, to ensure that a gate voltage of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b> does not exceed the positive withstand voltage of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a conducted current is comparatively large in the foregoing ESD circuit when the gate and the source of the P-type enhanced GaN power device <b>30</b> have a reverse voltage bias. As a result, the ESD circuit is incompatible with a gate negative voltage test for detecting a gate-related defect, which makes it difficult for the device to have both reliability and ESD tolerance.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This application provides a gallium nitride-based ESD protection circuit, which is compatible with a gate negative voltage test for a P-type enhanced GaN power device and also improves an ESD event tolerance capability of the power device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, this application provides an ESD protection circuit, including: a negative ESD protection module and a positive ESD protection module.

The first field effect transistor and the second field effect transistor form a path, thereby releasing negative ESD energy from the gate of the P-type enhanced GaN power device relative to the source of the P-type enhanced GaN power device.
