In particular, the invention describes systems enabling a catheter to be introduced directly through a vessel opening without an external sheath wherein a distal tip of the catheter is protected by a protective cover. Methods of introducing catheters into vessels and kits are also described.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Neuro-intervention (NI) procedures utilizing catheter systems to gain access to the cerebral arteries for the treatment of ischemic stroke are varied in terms of approach and the catheter systems utilized. Similarly, other intervention procedures to access other target vessels including the heart or other target areas through the vasculature utilize a range of catheter systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many cases, and in particular NI and cardiac-intervention (CI) procedures, access to the vasculature is obtained through the femoral artery, mainly due to its size and its proximity to the skin. While the femoral artery is an advantageous access point, there are downsides to its use primarily due to recovery times when NI and CI procedures are conducted through this location. For example, when a procedure is conducted through the femoral artery, a patient must typically be kept in a treatment center for a longer period of time due to the need for more time for the access wound to heal before allowing the patient to walk.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In comparison, if an NI or CI procedure is conducted through a radial artery, the patient can be discharged more quickly as the healing of the access wound does not prevent the patient becoming ambulatory almost immediately following the procedure. Hence, in an effort to save hospital and other treatment costs, there is a preference, when appropriate to conduct procedures via the arm arteries.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the radial/brachial arteries are smaller and thus generally present limitations and complications for certain procedures. Specifically, there is an upper limit on the size of catheters that be introduced into the arm arteries using conventional artery access equipment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the invention, a system for introducing a catheter into the vasculature through a vessel opening (VO) is described, the system including a catheter having an internal diameter and external diameter;

As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;distal&#x201d;, &#x201c;proximal&#x201d;, &#x201c;forward&#x201d;, &#x201c;rearward&#x201d;, &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if a feature in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. A feature may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. Similarly, the terms &#x201c;upwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;downwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and the like are used herein for the purpose of explanation only unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;attached&#x201d; to, &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; with, &#x201c;contacting&#x201d;, etc., another element, it can be directly on, attached to, connected to, coupled with or contacting the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being, for example, &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;, &#x201c;directly attached&#x201d; to, &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; to, &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; with or &#x201c;directly contacting&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc may be used herein to describe various elements, components, etc., these elements, components, etc. should not be limited by these terms.

For the purposes of illustration, components depicted in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. In particular, directions of width and length may be distorted with respect to one another in that widths generally reflect the internal diameters of arteries (typically mm scale) whereas lengths reflect the lengths of arteries (typically a cm+ scale). Thus, for clarity, the &#x201c;length&#x201d; scale is generally (but not necessarily) compressed with respect to the width scale and/or shows breaks in the length of components. As such, emphasis is placed on highlighting the various contributions of the components to the functionality of various aspects of the invention.

In accordance with the prior art, the AAS typically includes an internal guide/introducer <b>20</b> having a pointed distal tip <b>22</b> and an external sheath <b>30</b>. Both the internal guide and the external sheath have known extracorporeal connectors <b>24</b>, <b>32</b> that during insertion into the BV are connected at junction <b>25</b> allowing the assembled AAS to be inserted together. The overall length of an internal guide <b>20</b> is typically in the range of 15 cm and the external sheath <b>30</b> typically has an overall length of about 12 cm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043">After the AAS has been introduced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the internal guide <b>20</b> and wire W are removed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>) thus providing a conduit into the vessel through the external sheath <b>30</b> that allows fluids and/or instruments to be introduced into the vessel through the AAS.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044">In accordance with the invention, the inventor recognized that the introduction of a larger bore catheter such as an aspiration catheter (AC) suitable for aspirating a clot from the cerebral arteries would be too large to be introduced into smaller vessels (such as the radial or brachial arteries) within an external sheath <b>30</b>. That is, the external sheath of a radial artery AAS has a practical maximum internal diameter of about 6 F (OD of about 7.2 F) to allow the passage of a 6 F AC through the external sheath whereas it is desirable to introduce ACs into the cerebral vessels that have outside diameters greater than 6 F (eg. about 6-8 F).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0045">Hence, there has been need for arterial access assemblies (AAAs) that enable the introduction of larger catheters such as an aspiration catheter (AC) into the radial arteries. AAAs are described herein with reference to ACs and cerebral access procedures, although it is understood that different types of catheters for different procedures are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0046">As described in Applicant's co-pending applications, U.S. provisional application 62/878,652 filed Jul. 25, 2019, U.S. provisional application 63/029,401 filed May 23, 2020 and International patent application PCT/CA2020/051026 filed Jul. 24, 2020, all incorporated herein by reference, the design of an aspiration catheter that can be maneuvered from the arterial access point (e.g. groin or radial artery) is characterized by a soft distal tip section that is both sufficiently soft to be atraumatic as it navigates through the cerebral arteries, flexible enough to pass through tight curves and also allow effective suction to be applied to a blood clot. Also, the tip is radio-opaque to allow visualization during navigation through neck and intracranial vessels.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0047">Importantly, in order to ensure that the AC is suitable for aspiration, the AC tip generally cannot have a taper at its distal tip (i.e. a narrower wall thickness at the distal tip tapering to a wider wall thickness in the proximal direction) as an AC requires a certain radial stiffness to prevent the distal tip from collapsing when suction is being applied to a clot.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048">It is also important that when an AAS is being deployed through a VO that the risk of damaging the vessel wall is minimized. Thus, while equipment being pushed into a vessel can tightly engage the vessel, AASs have generally been designed such that the external sheath has an internal taper that enables a smooth transition between the internal guide and external sheath without a significant edge at point <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). The absence of a significant edge at the boundary between the internal guide and external sheath allows the external sheath to be pushed through the VO while engaged with the vessel wall without damaging the vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">The inventor also realized it would be desirable to be able to introduce an AC into a radial artery with the AC being supported internally by an internal guide <b>20</b> with the tapered tip <b>22</b> of the internal guide protruding from the end of the AC. However, the inventor recognized that the transition between the internal guide <b>20</b> and AC is problematic due to the oblique shape of the distal tip of an AC, the softness/flexibility of the distal tip of the AC, the presence of a radio-opaque marker and the lack of distal taper. In other words, without a substantially equivalent stiffness as a comparable external sheath (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>), the distal tip of an AC supported by an internal guide alone has a tendency to crumple and/or buckle with respect to the internal guide when the two are combined as an internal guide and AC. In particular, this problem occurs when such an assembly is being pushed through the vessel opening VO and for a number of centimeters upstream of the VO.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0050">The inventor recognized that in order for the soft distal tip of an AC to pass through and past the VO, a portion of the distal tip of the AC must be protected for its passage through the first 0-15+ cm (approximately) of the vessel as the surgeon is pushing the AC upstream, for example, towards the aortic arch. Generally, internal support in the form of an introducer is not needed after the initial approximate 15 cm as the arteries become sufficiently large that the AC tip will not be tightly engaged against the VW and will be able to be pushed forward without internal support and without crumpling.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0051">Accordingly, in a first embodiment of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, a system (referred herein as an arterial access assembly (AAA)) for advancing an AC through a VO and into such smaller arteries is described.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, an assembled AC and internal guide <b>40</b> having an AC distal tip protection system (DTPS) is shown (AAA). The internal guide <b>40</b> is similar in design to prior art internal guides <b>20</b> insomuch as it has a tapered distal tip <b>40</b><i>a </i>and an internal bore allowing a wire to pass through its center. In contrast to past internal guides, the length is sufficient to extend the full length of an AC (or equivalent) and protrude beyond the proximal end of the AC. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> show an assembled AC/internal guide assembly (AAA) pushed through a VO and a short distance into an intracorporeal zone (IC) of a vessel as well as extracorporeal zone (EC) where the AAA can be manipulated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0053">In greater detail, the internal guide <b>40</b> is sufficiently long to extend beyond the proximal end of the AC and be capable of manipulation from the proximal end of the AC. In addition, the internal guide <b>40</b> includes the DTPS that is formed as part of the internal guide to protect and prevent buckling of the AC tip as it is being inserted through the VO and into the artery.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A</figref>, in various embodiments, the DTPS includes a plurality of biased or elastic arms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) or sheath (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) <b>42</b> configured to the internal guide <b>40</b> adjacent and/or forming part of its tapered surface <b>40</b><i>a </i>that function as a protective sheath for the distal tip AC<b>1</b> of the AC during the critical steps of passing the distal tip AC<b>1</b> of the AC through the skin (i.e. VO) and pushing it forward through the narrowest portions of a vessel. The elastic arms/sheath <b>42</b> provide partial or full circumferential cover to the distal tip AC<b>1</b> of the AC whether a single body or multiple arms.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0055">The DTPS has a distal end <b>42</b><i>a </i>secured to the internal guide <b>40</b> and a proximal end <b>42</b><i>b </i>that covers the distal tip AC<b>1</b> of the AC. The DTPS extends proximally a sufficient distance to frictionally engage over a sufficient length of the AC so as to prevent separation/buckling of the AC<b>1</b> with respect to the internal guide <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0056">As shown schematically, the proximal end of the AC includes a stop AC<b>3</b> that defines a proximal end of the AC. Similarly, the internal guide <b>40</b> includes a proximal end stop <b>40</b><i>b. </i>The end stop <b>40</b><i>b </i>and AC<b>2</b> are separated a short distance shown as &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A</figref>. As can be understood, by manipulating both the end stop <b>40</b><i>b </i>and AC<b>2</b> with respect to one another, the AC and internal guide <b>40</b> can telescopically move with respect to one another.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the end stop <b>40</b><i>b </i>and AC<b>2</b> have been moved towards one another to a distance &#x201c;b&#x201d;. As can be seen, this has moved the internal guide <b>40</b> distally with respect to the AC such that the proximal edges <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the elastic arms <b>42</b> are distal to AC<b>1</b>. Distance &#x201c;b&#x201d; can be zero where the end stop <b>40</b><i>b </i>and AC<b>2</b> abut one another.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0058">The internal guide <b>40</b> can be provided with one or more recesses <b>42</b><i>d </i>within the internal guide <b>40</b> such that as the elastic arm ends <b>42</b><i>b </i>of DTPS move past AC<b>1</b>, they will be drawn into the recess(es) <b>42</b><i>d </i>(dotted line) and thus become flush (or recessed) with respect to the external surface of the internal guide <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0059">Thereafter, the end stop <b>40</b><i>b </i>can be moved proximally to a length greater than &#x201c;a&#x201d; (shown as &#x201c;c&#x201d;) and relative to AC<b>2</b> such that the internal guide <b>40</b> can be withdrawn from the AC with the DTPS being able to pass into AC through AC<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0060">The internal guide <b>40</b> can then be fully removed from the AC thus having introduced the AC into the vessel and allowing further steps of the procedure to be completed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0061">Typically, the AC/internal guide assembly (AAA) would be pushed forward a distance up to about 15 cm from the VO before conducting the steps as described above.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> show a different embodiment of the DIPS.
