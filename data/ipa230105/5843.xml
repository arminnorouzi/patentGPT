The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. Elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The structures and integrated tools provide a high-quality copper interface with low resistivity in vias and line interconnects. The methods use an integrated tool to first deposit a copper doped with high dopant such as, but not limited to, manganese (Mn), aluminum (Al), graphene, or magnesium (Mg), which keeps the highly doped copper at the via and trench interfaces (barrier interfaces). A slight anneal and reflow process moves the dopant towards the interface of the dielectric and barrier layer, improving the barrier layer and electro migration (EM) properties. A second process of reflow fills the vias and trenches with pure or low doped copper for the bulk or center of trenches, resulting in low resistivity. The structures and methods of the present principles have the advantages of improved line EM and TDDB (time dependent dielectric breakdown) with increased dopant at the interfaces, improved via EM which allows scaling of dual damascene to sub 30 nm pitch, high dopant in via and trench sidewalls which allows, for example Ta&#x2014;Mn O&#x2014;N formation, to enhance barrier properties, scaling of barrier layer thickness (dead area) with dopant protection, and reduced line resistivity as the dopant in trench bulk areas is kept low.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Scaling the liner and barrier layers for advanced interconnects is difficult as the scaling causes issues with gapfill, electro migration, and TDDB. Current densities within vias are also significantly higher which leads to copper voids and open circuits. The bottom of the via is the weakest link (due to uneven grains and lower activation energy (Ea)) for copper diffusion and potential micro voids during gapfill processes. The traditional processes use pure copper fill or copper alloy with same amount of dopant throughout. Thus, higher dopant content is required to get the same EM and barrier performance, resulting in higher resistivity. The inventors have discovered that by creating a two-part copper process having a dopant such as Mn in the first 30 A to 70 A, the process can allow for improved dopant at the interface and via bottom, improving EM and barrier properties. Subsequently deposited pure copper (or lower dopant copper) allows for low resistivity in the rest of the interconnect (e.g., trenches).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, a feature on a substrate may include an interconnect structure, a trench structure, a damascene structure, a via structure (e.g., a dual damascene via, etc.) and the like. Different types of features may be used as examples in some embodiments but are not meant to be limiting to only that feature type. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a method <b>100</b> of dual metallization for dual damascene via and trench structures on a substrate in accordance with some embodiments. The method <b>100</b> may be performed in an integrated tool (e.g., integrated tool <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) without a vacuum break between processes, ensuring high quality interfaces. The method <b>100</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref>. In block <b>102</b>, a substrate is received with at least one dual damascene via and trench formed on the substrate. The via may or may not have an etch stop layer at the bottom of the via. As depicted in a view <b>200</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the substrate has a first dielectric layer <b>202</b> with metallic material <b>204</b> underlying an etch stop layer <b>206</b>. A second dielectric layer <b>208</b> has been formed on the etch stop layer <b>206</b>. A via <b>210</b> and a first trench <b>212</b> have been formed in a dual damascene process along with a second trench <b>214</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the portion of the etch stop layer at the bottom <b>216</b> of the via has been removed, exposing the underlying portion of the metallic material <b>204</b>. The exposed portion of the metallic material <b>204</b> will immediately begin corroding and oxidizing when exposed to air/moisture. The substrate must then be subsequently transferred and processed within a certain time period or queue time limit, or the substrate may be too damaged to process. The queue time is the amount of time that hydrogen passivated wafers can be exposed to air (moisture) before requiring to be in an inert environment for further processing. The inventors have found that the queue time may be eliminated by receiving the substrate with the etch stop layer <b>206</b> remaining intact in the bottom <b>218</b> of the via <b>210</b> as depicted in a view <b>200</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.
