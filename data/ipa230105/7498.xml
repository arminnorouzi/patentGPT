FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments herein relate to a User Equipment (UE), a network node and methods therein. In some aspects, they relate to handling of SpCells in a wireless communications network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a typical wireless communication network, wireless devices, also known as wireless communication devices, mobile stations, stations (STA) and/or User Equipment (UE), communicate via a Local Area Network such as a Wi-Fi network or a Radio Access Network (RAN) to one or more core networks (CN). The RAN covers a geographical area which is divided into service areas or cell areas, which may also be referred to as a beam or a beam group, with each service area or cell area being served by a radio network node such as a radio access node e.g., a Wi-Fi access point or a radio base station (RBS), which in some networks may also be denoted, for example, a NodeB, eNodeB (eNB), or gNB as denoted in 5G. A service area or cell area is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio network node. The radio network node communicates over an air interface operating on radio frequencies with the wireless device within range of the radio network node.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Specifications for the Evolved Packet System (EPS), also called a Fourth Generation (4G) network, have been completed within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and this work continues in the coming 3GPP releases, for example to specify a Fifth Generation (5G) network also referred to as 5G New Radio (NR). The EPS comprises the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), also known as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio access network, and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), also known as System Architecture Evolution (SAE) core network. E-UTRAN/LTE is a variant of a 3GPP radio access network wherein the radio network nodes are directly connected to the EPC core network rather than to RNCs used in 3G networks. In general, in E-UTRAN/LTE the functions of a 3G RNC are distributed between the radio network nodes, e.g. eNodeBs in LTE, and the core network. As such, the RAN of an EPS has an essentially &#x201c;flat&#x201d; architecture comprising radio network nodes connected directly to one or more core networks, i.e. they are not connected to RNCs. To compensate for that, the E-UTRAN specification defines a direct interface between the radio network nodes, this interface being denoted the X2 interface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multi-antenna techniques may significantly increase the data rates and reliability of a wireless communication system. The performance is in particular improved if both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple antennas, which results in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication channel. Such systems and/or related techniques are commonly referred to as MIMO.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mobility in 3GPP 5G NR Release-15</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Early during the 3GPP Release-15 standardization, it was agreed that NR would support two types of mobility:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">Mobility without Radio Resource Control (RRC) involvement (intra-cell);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">Mobility with RRC involvement (inter-cell);</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">Mobility with RRC involvement is quite similar to the LTE mobility functionality: it is based on event-driven measurement reporting over RRC, where the UE performs measurement on various reference signals (mapping to cells) and filters these measurements. When the filtered measurements fulfil certain criteria parametrized by the NW, the UE will trigger a measurement report. However, differently from LTE a cell may be defined by multiple beams, which may be realized by multiple Synchronisation Signal (SS)/Physical broadcast channel (PBCH) Blocks (SSB)s transmitted in different directional beams, while in LTE a single broadcasted signal is transmitted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> which depicts differences between cell definition in NR and LTE.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">That leads to a procedure where changing beams from different cells require RRC signaling and a set of UE protocols actions e.g. reset of buffers, etc.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts Inter-cell inter-node beam changing, handover realized with RRC signaling in 3GPP Release-15.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">According to 3GPP TS 38.300, for inter-gNB handover, inter-cell and inter-node mobility, the signaling procedures consist of at least the following elemental components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> Inter-gNB handover procedures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">1. The source gNB initiates handover and issues a HANDOVER REQUEST over the Xn interface. This is possibly based on measurement reports, which may have been configured when the UE enters Connected state.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">2. The target gNB performs admission control and provides the new RRC configuration as part of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">3. The source gNB provides the RRC configuration to the UE by forwarding the RRCReconfiguration message received in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE. The RRCReconfiguration message includes at least cell ID and all information required to access the target cell so that the UE may access the target cell without reading system information. For some cases, the information required for contention-based and contention-free random access may be included in the RRCReconfiguration message. The access information to the target cell may include beam specific information, if any.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">4. The UE moves the RRC connection to the target gNB and replies with the RRCReconfigurationComplete.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">NOTE: User Data may also be sent in step 4 if the grant allows.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">The handover mechanism triggered by RRC requires the UE at least to reset an MAC entity and re-establish Radio Link Control (RLC). RRC managed handovers with and without Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) entity re-establishment are both supported. For Data Radio Bearer (DRB) using RLC Acknowledged mode (AM) mode, PDCP may either be re-established together with a security key change or initiate a data recovery procedure without a key change. For DRBs using RLC Unacknowledged Mode (UM); mode and for Signaling Radio Bearers (SRBs), PDCP may either be re-established together with a security key change or remain as it is without a key change. Data forwarding, in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance at handover may be guaranteed when the target gNB uses the same DRB configuration as the source gNB. Timer based handover failure procedure is supported in NR. RRC connection re-establishment procedure is used for recovering from handover failure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">Mobility without RRC involvement is also known as beam management. It was designed for a situation where multiple beams cover one cell. Due to the smaller coverage area of these narrow beams, it could be anticipated that a UE would change beam more frequently than it changes cells. To reduce the signaling load for the beam switches, it was decided that RRC signaling would not be required to facilitate such changes. Instead, signaling solution based on Multiple Access Control protocol (MAC) Control Element (CE) or Downlink Control. Information (DCI) has been introduced for beam management/intra-cell mobility. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicting Beam switching within the same cell.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">Three examples of sub-functionality to support beam management are the following:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0021">Layer 1 (L1)-Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) reporting on SSB and Channel-State Information-Reference Signal (CSI-RS);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0022">MAC CE based activation/deactivation updates of beam indications, so-called Quasi-Co-Location (QCL) source, explained in the following in more details);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0023">Beam failure recovery/radio link monitoring/beam failure detection.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">As these functionalities were designed to handle mobility without RRC involvement, they were limited to intra-cell operations. In the following, some background about some existing fundamental concepts in the 5G NR L1 specifications are provided: Beam indications, Quasi-Co-Location (QCL) source and Transmission Configuration Indication (TCI) states.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">Beam Indications, QCL Source and TCI States</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">Several signals may be transmitted from the same base station antenna from different antenna ports. These signals may have the same large-scale properties, for instance in terms of Doppler shift/spread, average delay spread, or average delay, when measured at the receiver. These antenna ports are then said to be QCL.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">The network may then signal to the UE that two antenna ports are QCL so that the UE interprets that signals from these will have some similar properties. If the UE knows that two antenna ports are QCL with respect to a certain parameter, e.g. Doppler spread, the UE may estimate that parameter based on a reference signal transmitted one of the antenna ports and use that estimate when receiving another reference signal or physical channel the other antenna port. Typically, the first antenna port is represented by a measurement reference signal such as a CSI-RS, known as source RS, and the second antenna port is a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), known as target RS, for physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) or physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) reception.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">For instance, if antenna ports A and B are QCL with respect to average delay, the UE may estimate the average delay from the signal received from antenna port A (known as the source reference signal (RS)) and assume that the signal received from antenna port B (target RS) has the same average delay. This is useful for demodulation since the UE may know beforehand the properties of the channel when trying to measure the channel utilizing the DMRS, which may help the UE in for instance selecting an appropriate channel estimation filter.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">Information about what assumptions may be made regarding QCL is signaled to the UE from the network. In NR, four types of QCL relations between a transmitted source RS and transmitted target RS were defined:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0030">Type A: {Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread}</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0031">Type B: {Doppler shift, Doppler spread}</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0032">Type C: {average delay, Doppler shift}</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0033">Type D: {Spatial Rx parameter}</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">QCL type D was introduced to facilitate beam management procedures with analog beamforming and is known as spatial QCL. There is currently no strict definition of spatial QCL, but the understanding is that if two transmitted antenna ports are spatially QCL, the UE may use the same Rx beam to receive signals associated to them. This is helpful for a UE that uses analog beamforming to receive signals, since the UE need to adjust its Receiving (RX) beam in some direction prior to receiving a certain signal. If the UE knows that the signal is spatially QCL with some other signal it has received earlier, then it may safely use the same RX beam to receive also this signal. Note that for beam management, the discussion mostly revolves around QCL Type D, but it is also necessary to convey a Type A QCL relation for the RSs to the UE, so that it may estimate all the relevant large-scale parameters. In other words, one could say that two signals are transmitted in the same direction or via the same downlink beams when these are QCL Type D. Hence, the network may give this relation between a channel to be decoded (e.g. PDCCH/PDSCH) and a signal that is known to be transmitted in a given direction that may be used as reference by the UE, like a CSI-RS, SSB, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">Typically, this is achieved by configuring the UE with a CSI-RS for tracking, TRS&#x2014;Tracking Reference Signal, for time/frequency offset estimation (and/or SSB). To be able to use any QCL reference, the UE would have to receive it with a sufficiently good SINR. In many cases, this means that the TRS has to be transmitted in a suitable beam to a certain UE.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">Together with the concept of QLC source there is the concept of a TCI state. Each of the M states in the list of TCI states may be interpreted as a list of M possible beams transmitted in the downlink from the network and/or a list of M possible Transmission Points (TRP)s used by the network to communicate with the UE. The M TCI states may also be interpreted as a combination of one or multiple beams transmitted from one or multiple TRPs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037">To introduce dynamics in beam and TRP selection/switching, the UE may be configured through RRC signaling with M TCI states (e.g. during connection setup, resume, reconfiguration, handovers, etc.), where M is up to 128 in frequency range <b>2</b> (FR2) for the purpose of PDSCH reception and up to 8 in FR1, depending on UE capability.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0038">In terms of RRC signaling, TCI states are currently configured as part of the so-called CellGroupConfig, which is a Distributed Unit (DU) configuration (i.e. decided by the baseband unit) in a Central Unit (CU)-DU split architecture, and conveyed to the UE via for example an RRCResume (i.e. during transition from Inactive to Connected) or RRCReconfiguration (e.g. during handovers, intra-cell reconfigurations or transitions from Idle to Connected), as in the example

A UE first detects and decodes PDCCH and the decoding is successfully, it then decodes the corresponding PDSCH based on the decoded control information in the PDCCH. Uplink data transmission may also be dynamically scheduled using PDCCH. Similar to downlink, a UE first decodes uplink grants in PDCCH and then transmits data over PUSCH based the decoded control information in the uplink grant such as modulation order, coding rate, uplink resource allocation, etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">An example of how the TCI States are mapped to the code points in DCI Transmission Configuration Indication field in NR-Rel-15 is now given.

Due to a possibly smaller coverage area of these narrow beams, it is anticipated that a UE would change beam more frequently than it changes cells. To reduce the signaling load for the beam switches, it was decided that RRC signaling would not be required to facilitate such changes. Instead, signaling solution based on MAC CE or DCI was introduced in the NR L1 specifications.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0079">The signaling during a beam switch involves a so called changing of the QCL source for the PDCCH and/or PDSCH. The QCL properties of the source enable the UE to demodulate the PDCCH/PDSCH DMRS by providing some guidance to the channel estimation. So, in summary, the following observation may be made: The beam management functionality specified in 3GPP Release-15 provides the mechanisms to change the QCL source for the PDCCH/PDSCH DMRS via MAC CE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts Mobility interruption time, wherein RAR means Random Access Response</p><p id="p-0064" num="0080">Once the UE has been provided with a new QCL source, it performs measurements on the corresponding RS to derive the relevant QCL properties. These QCL properties are then used when demodulating the PDCCH/PDSCH. As was intended, the update of the QCL source has low overhead and low latency. The MAC CE message is only two octets, and the UE applies the newly activated QCL source 3 ms after the HARQ ACK for the MAC CE message has been sent. Hence, in summary, the following observation may be made: the beam management functionality specified in Rel-15 provides the mechanisms to change the QCL source for the PDCCH/PDSCH DMRS via MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0081">Note that the MAC CE indication is a synchronized procedure: The NW and the UE has the same understanding of when the update configuration takes effect. And, differently from RRC procedures like an RRCReconfiguration, there is no acknowledgement message, e.g. upon receiving an RRCReconfiguration the UE transmits to the network an RRCReconfigurationComplete.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0082">In 5G NR, the network has the possibility to provide the UE with a completely new RRC configuration in the handover command. For instance, the configuration for the DMRSs or the PDCCH/PDSCH scrambling may be different in the new cell compared to the old cell. However, in contrast to LTE, there are no physical layer parameters that are hardcoded based on the physical cell identity (PCI) in NR. It is thus possible quite some similar physical layer configurations in serving and target cell.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0083">In this case, it has been argued in R1-1902528 Lower-layer mobility enhancements (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG1_RD/TSGR1_96/Docs//R1-1902528.zip) that the only thing that is needed for the UE to be able to start receiving data on the physical layer in the target cell is that the QCL source is updated: this would enable the UE to align to the target cell in an indicated direction to demodulate the bits and decode the data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0084">As

The reference signals are implicitly associated with a serving cell via a serving cell integer index: hence, in Release-15, it is only possible to change QCL source to reference signals transmitted within a serving cell, SpCell or associated SCell within that SpCell group: it is not possible to change the QCL source to a reference signal in a non-serving cell.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0086">It is noted that it is possible for the UE to perform measurements and derive at least some QCL properties from SSB transmitted from neighbour cells: this is what the UE would need to do to perform the Radio Resource Management (RRM) measurements to support L3-related procedures such as Secondary Cell Group (SCG) addition, synchronization with sync, i.e. handovers, etc. For example, to perform the SSB-based RSRP (SS-RSRP) measurements on a target cell, the UE would have to synchronize to the Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) of that target, detect the Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS) and demodulate the PBCH DMRS. The SS-RSRP is then measured on the SSS and optionally on the PBCH DMRS. To perform these actions, the UE would at least have to find the average delay of the SSB and may readily estimate the Doppler shift. Thus, a UE could easily use an SSB in a neighbour cell as a QCL source for PDCCH/PDSCH DMRS reception, providing that the UE previously performed measurements on that SSB.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0087">To be able to use this functionality, it has been proposed in 3GPP R1-1902528 Lower-layer mobility enhancements (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG1_RD/TSGR1_96/Docs//R1-1902528.zip) to introduce an identifier of the non-serving cell in the QCL-info where as proposed, a natural choice for such an identifier is the Physical Cell Identity (PCI).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0088">If a PCI would be introduced in the QCL-info, the network could update the QCL source to an RS in a non-serving cell. Once the indication command takes effect, the NW may directly start transmitting data over PDSCH from the new cell. Since the procedure is synchronized, the NW and the UE have the same understanding of when the updated configuration takes effect. Thus, the interruption in data communication may be eliminated.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0089">Multi-TRP Communications in 3GPP Release-16</p><p id="p-0075" num="0090">3GPP WG RAN1 has agreed to standardize a solution for multi-TRP communications.

developing embodiments herein the inventors identified a problem which first will be discussed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0144">The problem addressed herein is how to enable e.g. a PSCell addition or inactivation, and a mobility mechanism (inter-cell mobility) relying on lower layer signaling, i.e. in a protocol layer below RRC (also referred to as a protocol layer equal to or below MAC CE), like using a MAC CE where the UE may change cells, e.g. move from one beam from one cell to another beam from another cell, by an indication not involving RRC signaling or any other higher layer protocols i.e. above the MAC protocol in the stack, for example, via MAC CEs.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0145">A first existing solution is the one in the current 5G NR specifications. As discussed in the background, the existing solution in the standard (3GPP 5G NR Release-15) does not support this inter-cell beam switching use case without RRC signaling. In one hand, the standard has a mechanism for TCI state activation/deactivation which works as a way to make the UE switch Rx beams (or in other words, switch the direction it listens to/assuming the network starts transmitting in a different direction or Transmit (Tx) beam), as explained in the background. On the other hand, each TCI state may only be associated to a DL BWP of a cell in the CellGroupConfig, which may either be the spCell itself, like the PCell or PSCell, or a configured SCell.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="147pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>CellGroupConfig</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00047" he="2.46mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009; spCellConfig</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00048" he="2.46mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009; spCellConfigDedicated</entry><entry><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00049" he="2.46mm" wi="3.56mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00002.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> </entry><entry>TCI states configurations are always associated</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00050" he="2.46mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009; initialDownlinkBWP</entry><entry/><entry>to an spCell (i.e. a PCell<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00051" he="2.46mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00899.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009;or PSCell</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00052" he="2.46mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009; pdsch-Config</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00053" he="2.46mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00001.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> &#x2009; TCI-states configurations</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="left" id="FOO-00004"><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00054" he="2.46mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230007499A1-20230105-P00899.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>  indicates data missing or illegible when filed</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0123" num="0146">A second existing solution is the one presented in the background, and described in the contribution to 3GPP WG1 R1-1902528 Lower-layer mobility enhancements.

Therein, current agreements state that it should be possible for a UE to be connected to beams from multiple TRPs, where each beam may possibly be associated to different cells. In other words, that the UE should be able to have activated a QCL source for a given TCI state associated to a PDCCH configuration that is associated to a cell A, and at the same time have activated a QCL source for a TCI state associated to a PDCCH configuration that is associated to a cell B.

Hence, it remains unclear how to make that associated to non-serving cells;</li>        <li id="ul0023-0002" num="0151">Whether the notion of an SpCell remains the same or not. Currently, the UE changes PCell when performs a handover (or PSCell, if this is a PSCell/SCG change), but when it changes a TCI state it still maintains the same notion of PCell. In the contribution, nothing is mentioned about that.</li>        <li id="ul0023-0003" num="0152">It also remains unclear, the relation between these TCI states for non-serving cell and the UE configuration e.g. whether that is part of the CellGroupConfig, spCellConfig, etc. So, the overall signaling considerations is missing.</li>        <li id="ul0023-0004" num="0153">A standard contribution proposes to introduce an identifier of the non-serving cell in the QCL-info and indicates that a natural choice for such an identifier is the physical cell identity (PCI).

In some embodiments, it is possible to configure the UE with TCI states associated to different SpCells that may have different common configuration(s).</p><p id="p-0129" num="0156">A general advantage exists in deployments where the network functionality processing RRC message and the network functionality processing MAC messages are placed in different locations. For example, in a CU/DU split architecture as defined by 3GPP. If CU where RRC messages are processed, are placed in a cloud environment, possibly further from the UE compared to the DU, where MAC messages and related functions are processed, RRC measurement reports and RRC Reconfigurations for handovers will take longer to get to the UE as that may also require some DU/CU signaling e.g. to modify the DU context. Hence, using MAC CE for inter-cell mobility also has the potential to reduce the delays in inter-cell mobility due to the potential to avoid CU/DU signaling that exists today.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a schematic overview depicting a wireless communications network <b>100</b> wherein embodiments herein may be implemented.

That also comprises the UE switching from a current configuration to a new configuration, according to the new target. The new configuration may contain some UE-specific configuration that is the same as the current configuration according to source i.e. that part of the configuration remains unchanged when the UE performs L1-based mobility.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0224">One relevant scenario where L1-based mobility may be applied is when multiple cells are deployed and defined in the same DU in the network side.

example of UE-specific configuration that is defined for each SpCell(s), current and additional, is the TCI states configurations. The UE's current TCI state configuration comprises the TCI state configurations in the current SpCell and the TCI states configurations from all additional SpCell(s), where each TCI state configuration is configured in each SpCell. In other words, any of these TCI states configurations are part of the current UE's configuration and may be activated and/or deactivated with MAC CEs. This is to some extent similar to the handling of TCI states within a Cell Group where each serving cell (e.g. SpCell and SCell(s)) contain their own TCI states configurations that are considered part of the UE's current configuration and may be activated and/or deactivated via MAC CE. Herein, according to the method, the principle applied for SCells is applied for the additional SpCell(s).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0249">One way to implement this alternative of having both cell-specific and UE-specific configurations in the current and additional SpCell(s) is to define a new interpretation of the SCell list in CellGroupConfig. According to current RRC specifications, the UE may be configured with a CellGroupConfig for the MCG or SCG configuration comprising an SpCell configuration and configurations for each configured SCell. In a way, one may say that the UE may be configured with a set of SCell(s) where each of these are candidate cells for carrier aggregation. Then, UE may receive specific MAC CEs to activate and/or deactivate SCell(s) and/or their TCI states that have been configured in the CellGroupConfig, where these are the highlighted MAC CEs used for that purpose:</p><p id="p-0188" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00014" num="00014"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="154pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Index</entry><entry>LCID values</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>52</entry><entry>TCI State Indication for UE-specific PDCCH</entry></row><row><entry>53</entry><entry>TCI States Activation/Deactivation for UE-</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>specific PDSCH</entry></row><row><entry>57</entry><entry>SCell Activation/Deactivation (four octet)</entry></row><row><entry>58</entry><entry>SCell Activation/Deactivation (one octet)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0189" num="0250">In this variant of the provided method the list of SCell(s) may also be used to indicate cells that may also be candidates as additional SpCells, according to what is described in this document as additional SpCell(s). This variant may comprise two different ways to enable the UE to distinguish that a given cell and its configuration in the list is an SCell or an SpCell candidate. In the first way, a new field is added to indicate that the cell is an SpCell candidate. In another way, this is implicitly indicated e.g. by the fact that the SCell frequency is in the same frequency as the SpCell frequency (i.e. the frequency of the SpCell where the UE has been configured).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0251">In this variant, there may also be different ways to trigger lower layer mobility. In one embodiment, the same MAC CE used for SCell activation is received by the UE and upon reception, if that is activating a cell in the list known to be an SpCell candidate, the UE performs lower layer mobility (i.e. synchronizes with the new cell and apply parameters associated to the configured cell in the Scell configuration list). In another solution, a new MAC CE is defined for lower layer mobility, to distinguish from SCell activation. There may be a third solution enabling the UE to distinguish yet another use case: multi-TRP transmission. In that third solution, the candidate for SpCell may also be a candidate for inter-cell multi-TRP transmission. In that solution, the UE may receive a MAC CE that indicates the addition of that cell for inter-cell multi-TRP transmission, distinguishing from lower layer mobility and SCell activation/deactivation.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0252">The advantage of this variant of reusing the SCell list is the minimized changes to the specifications as the SCell signalling is used, though with a different interpretation, a broader one, as the cells are not any longer only SCell but may be SpCEII candidates or candidates for inter-cell multi-TRP transmissions.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0253">That embodiment may comprise an additional configuration in the SCell configuration to indicate to the UE that this is a candidate for lower layer mobility i.e. a candidate to be an SpCell, and not an SCell. That may be an indication e.g. a flag or a specific configuration that is applicable for SpCell(s). Hence, upon reception of a MAC CE whose identifier is associated to that cell whose indication indicates that this is an SpCell candidate, the UE performs inter-cell lower layer mobility instead of activating an SCell.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0254">The embodiment of the method may also comprise the configuration of an SpCell index, like the spCellIndex of IE ServCellIndex above, for the current SpCell, that is configured in spCellConfig of IE SpCellConfig. The reasoning is that the current SpCell, e.g. cell-A where UE resumes, should be possibly referred in a TCI state configurations in case the UE performs inter-cell mobility with lower layer signalling to another cell (cell-B) and afterwards network later decides to activate a TCI state of cell-A. In this alternative, the current SpCell is the one where the UE entered Connected state e.g. from Inactive and/or Idle. Hence, when the UE receives that configuration in an RRC Resume like message (in response to an RRC Resume Request like message) or in a first RRCReconfiguration after coming from Idle the UE interprets the SpCellConfig as the configuration for the cell the UE is currently resuming, while the additional SpCell configurations are the ones the UE may be moved with lower layer signalling. That aspect (index for the current SpCell) is novel compared to existing specifications. Even though there is a serving cell index in the SpCell configuration for the current SpCell the UE enters Connected state e.g. upon resume, that index is only used for a PSCell configuration, i.e. the field is absent for an MCGs, when the SpCellConfig refers to a PCell, as shown in the excerpt below taken from NR RCC specifications (TS 38.331):</p><p id="p-0194" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00015" num="00015"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>-- Serving cell specific MAC and PHY parameters for a SpCell:</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SpCellConfig :=</entry><entry>SEQUENCE {</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;servCellIndex</entry><entry>&#x2003;ServCellIndex &#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;OPTIONAL, &#x2003;--</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Cond SCG</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;reconfigurationWithSync</entry><entry>&#x2003;ReconfigurationWithSync</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OPTIONAL, &#x2003;-- Cond ReconfWithsync</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;rlf-TimersAndConstants</entry><entry>&#x2003;SetupRelease { RLF-TimersAndConstants }</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OPTIONAL, &#x2003;-- Need M</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</entry><entry>&#x2003;ENUMERATED (n1)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OPTIONAL, &#x2003;-- Need S</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;spCellConfigDedicated</entry><entry>&#x2003;ServingCellConfig</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OPTIONAL, &#x2003;-- Need M</entry></row><row><entry>. . .</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0195" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00016" num="00016"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="147pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Conditional Presence</entry><entry>Explanation</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>BWP-Reconfig</entry><entry>The field is optionally present, Need N, if the </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BWPs are reconfigured or if serving cells are </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>added or removed.

That also comprises the possibility to indicate which SpCell is to be considered when TCI states are to be activated/deactivated.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0258">Notice that, in current signalling in 3GPP Release15 and/or Release16, the SpCellConfig does not contain common configuration as that is assumed to be acquired by the UE via system information. However, according to the method the additional SpCell(s) have a common configuration, like ServingCellConfigCommon, and also the SpCell configuration, i.e. where the UE enters Connected. The reasoning is that when the UE performs L1-based mobility the UE may leave that cell and possibly come back. And, if it comes back it needs to have in its configuration the common configuration. That may be done by defining a UE variable where the UE stores the common configuration of the SpCell that has been initially configured, (signalling optimization since there is no need to signal that as UE has obtained via broadcasting, or by defining that explicitly in the signalling.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0259">In many of the presented embodiments, the UE has a list of indexes; each associated to a configured SpCell i.e. the current SpCell and all additional SpCell which are candidate to be activated via lower layer signalling like MAC CE(s).

In that sense, while the MAC CE is not encrypted, it only contains an integer from 0 to N (where N could be e.g. 8) regardless which are in the network the UE is located i.e. it would not reveal much about UE's location, the mapping between this integer and the cell identities is provided in an encrypted in the SRB1 messages.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0261">Variant Relying on a CellGroupConfigSet</p><p id="p-0205" num="0262">In yet another embodiment variant for the signaling, the UE is configured with common configuration for the whole set of SpCell(s), i.e. dedicated or UE-specific, like one of the variants where the additional SpCell configurations are provided only with cell-specific configurations.

Then, it receives an MCG configuration, e.g. masterCellGroupConfig within an RRCReconfiguration message, containing the cell-A spCellConfig of IE SpCellConfig for the current PCell, and the configuration for the additional SpCells. Each of these configurations include an SpCell index, in this example, SpCell-A has index=1, SpCell-B has index=2 and SpCell-C has index=3. Then, within spCellConfig of IE SpCellConfig, the UE is configured with a list of TCI states, where each TCI state may be associated to a configured SpCell. In the example above, the UE is configured with 4 TCI states:<ul id="ul0044" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0044-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0045" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0045-0001" num="0299">TCI-state ID=1 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1;</li>        <li id="ul0045-0002" num="0300">TCI-state ID=2 is associated to Pcell-B, hence it has an SpCell index=2;</li>        <li id="ul0045-0003" num="0301">TCI-state ID=3 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1;</li>        <li id="ul0045-0004" num="0302">TCI-state ID=4 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=3;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0245" num="0303">Notice that according to embodiments of the method even though the UE receives the list of TCI states as part of the spCellConfig, which in principle refers to the configuration of cell-A, the list is in fact a UE-specific configuration. I.e. a dedicated configuration, that is associated to the configured SpCells A, B and C. I.e. the TCI state configurations is common to the configured SpCells. Hence, a change in SpCell, e.g. activation of a TCI state of a different PCell than the current one, does not change the UE-specific configuration, but only the cell-specific configuration. In other words, the UE remains with the same list of configured TCI states.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0304">TCI State Activation for an Additional SpCell or First SpCell</p><p id="p-0247" num="0305">Activated/active SpCell: Here the notion of active and/or activated PCell, or SpCell in more general terms, is introduced. The notion of an active or activated PCell, or SpCell in more general terms, comprises the fact that the UE is configured with a list of SpCell(s) that may or may not be activated. I.e. activated meaning the fact that the UE has control channels being monitored associated to that SpCell and/or transmits/receives data. The reasoning here is that in the state of the art the UE always has a single PCell with a single UE's current configuration. And, according to the method, the UE has a list of configured SpCell(s). An SpCell is said to be active or activated if at least one of the TCI states associated to that SpCell is activated. Hence, according to the method, a TCI state activation for any physical channel, e.g. via lower layer signaling, may lead to the activation of one of the configured SpCell(s). This concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0306">An example of the method comprises the UE setting the SpCell state as &#x201c;activated&#x201d; for the cell the UE is connecting to when it initially receives the TCI states configurations with a list of configured PCell(s) e.g. when the UE is transitioning from IDLE to CONNECTED state, that is the cell where the UE receives the first RRCReconfiguration after being transitioned to CONNECTED state;</p><p id="p-0249" num="0307">The example of the method comprises the UE receiving a lower layer signaling command, like a MAC CE that contains an indication that points to one of the configured SpCell(s). That indication may be a serving cell index, e.g. SpCellIndex, that is configured at the UE for each configured SpCell. Hence, upon reception of the MAC CE, the UE knows which SpCell the network wants the UE to consider active and/or activated. The method comprises an implicit deactivation of other SpCell(s) upon the activation of an SpCell.

In this embodiment, one could possibly reuse the MAC CE structure for multi-TRP and for L1-based mobility.</li>        <li id="ul0055-0003" num="0337">Another sub-alternative embodiment is to ignore the Serving cell ID and only rely on the TCI state IDs. In that case, in addition to being able to configure TCI states for an SpCell and SCells, one may include other remaining TCI states, e.g. 65, 66, 67, and associate them to SpCell candidates. Then, when at least one TCI state, NOT associated to any other serving cell, is linked to a given SpCell there is a L1-based mobility. Notice that this could possibly be used for the multi-TRP case. Of course this embodiment may somehow limit the amount of TCI states and SpCell candidates that may be configured.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0267" num="0338">As described in the configurations aspects for additional SpCell(s), these may be additional PSCell(s) i.e. it should be possible to perform lower layer mobility via MAC CEs for PSCell changes. In that case, the configuration of additional SpCell(s) may be prepared by a secondary Node, which may be from the same RAT or from a different RAT. And, in that case, the MAC CE(s) or other lower layer signaling activating/deactivating TCI states associated to the PSCell may come from the PSCell.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0339">UE Actions Upon SpCell State Change (L1-Based Mobility)</p><p id="p-0269" num="0340">According to embodiments of the method, the UE receives a MAC CE and changes the state of one of its configured PCell(s) from deactivated to activated, SpCell in more general terms. This part describes UE actions upon reception of a MAC CE indicating the change of a TCI state associated to a deactivated PCell.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0341">In L1-based mobility, according to an example of the method, the UE may maintain one active PCell at time. Hence, if the UE receives a MAC CE activating a TCI state associated to a PCell that is deactivated, let's call it a target PCell, the UE considers the current PCell as deactivated and considers the target PCell as activated.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0342">Deactivating a source PCell and activating a new target PCell (where both are configured PCell(s) at the UE) comprises the UE applying parts of the configuration of the target PCell to its current configuration. According to the method, the UE-specific configurations remain the same upon the reception of that MAC CE, i.e., the configuration to be applied is the cell-specific configuration for the target SpCell, that overrides the current cell-specific configuration of the source SpCell. Taking signaling example shown above, for an additional SpCell configuration, the UE would then apply the spCellConfigCommon of IE ServingCellConfigCommon to its current configuration. At the same time, UE keeps its UE-specific configuration as before i.e. the list of TCI states configurations remain the same and network may still use MAC CEs in the target cell to activate and/or deactivate TCI states associated to any of the configured SpCells, either the one in spCellConfig or the additional ones, in the spCellConfigList.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0343">Upon changing the first time via MAC CE from the current SpCell to one of the additional SpCells, the method comprises the UE keeping stored storing the common and/or cell-specific configuration of the first SpCell, even though that has not been provided in dedicated signaling in spCellConfig of IE SpCellConfig. The reasoning is that if the network transmits another MAC CE indicating the activation of a TCI state associated to the first cell, the UE needs to apply that cell-specific configuration to its current configuration.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0344">There may be different assumptions regarding the synchronization between the UE and the candidate SpCells. If the UE is synchronized with a configured SpCell when it receives a MAC CE indicating the activation of a TCI state associated to that SpCell, there is no need to synchronize again. That may be the case when the UE has also been configured to perform measurements associated to that SpCell. Else, if the UE is NOT synchronized with a configured SpCell when it receives a MAC CE indicating the activation of a TCI state associated to that SpCell, the UE start synchronising to the DL of the target SpCell.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0345">In the following, the document describes an example of how the method may be implemented in the 5G NR specifications for the MAC protocol and the RRC protocol. For the MAC protocol, the RED/highlighted parts are new parts compared to existing MAC CE for TCI state activation/deactivation. However, that should not be interpreted necessarily as CRs to the specifications since one may need completely new MAC CEs for the purpose of L1-based mobility.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0346">Indication of TCI State for UE-Specific PDCCH</p><p id="p-0276" num="0347">The network may indicate a TCI state for PDCCH reception for a CORESET of a Serving Cell by sending the TCI State Indication for UE-specific PDCCH MAC CE described in clause 6.1.3.15.

That would mean that UE remains with the same UE-specific configuration upon the reception of the MAC CE with the new SpCell indication when changing from one cell to another within that set but may change any of the parameters with MAC CEs that are within a ReconfigurationWithSync.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0373">There may be different assumption regarding the UL sync with the target SpCells. If the UE is UL synchronized and if the target SpCell knows which DL beam in covering the UE, i.e. which DL beam to transmit PDCC and/or PDSCH, the UE performs a TCI state activation without any need for UL sync procedure. Else, if the UE is not UL synchronized and/or if the target SpCell does not know which DL beam in covering the UE, i.e. which DL beam to transmit PDCC/PDSCH, the UE first triggers a random-access procedure with the target cell e.g. by transmitting a preamble, possibly a dedicate preamble configured in the additional SpCell configuration, receiving a RAR and transmitting a MAC MSG.3 with its current Cell Radio Network Temporary Identifier (C-RNTI), which may either be a new one in the Additional SpCell configuration, or the same one used in the source SpCell.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0374">As in the case of an RRC based handover, there may also be a protection time, especially interesting in the case the UE performs a synchronization procedure, like random access.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0375">As in the case of an RRC based handover, the Additional SpCell configuration may also contain an SMTC configuration so the UE is able to perform measurements and find the target SpCell.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0376">Variant where Dedicated Configuration May Also be Updated</p><p id="p-0306" num="0377">Above, it has been assumed that mostly cell-specific parameters are updated when the network activates via MAC CE a TCI state associated to an SpCell that is deactivated at the UE and for which the UE has an additional SpCell configuration.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0378">In this variant of the methods described above, it is comprised the possibility to update UE-specific parameters upon the activation of an SpCell via MAC CE. To enable that, one first modification to 5.1 is to consider that each AdditionalSpCellConfig contains a dedicated configuration, in addition to the cell index as described in above, like different TCI states configurations. An example of an ASN.1 encoding is the following:</p><p id="p-0308" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00028" num="00028"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>AdditionalSpCellConfig :: =</entry><entry>SEQUENCE {</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;spCellIndex</entry><entry>ServCellIndex,</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;spCellConfigCommon</entry><entry>&#x2003;ServingCellConfigCommon,</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;spCellConfigDedicated</entry><entry>&#x2003;ServingCellConfig</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>. . .</entry></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0309" num="0379">The overall concept for this variant configuration may be illustrated in the following example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0380">In this example, the UE starts in IDLE state camping on a cell-A (i.e. it has acquired common/cell-specific parameters for cell-A) and transitions to CONNECTED. Then, it receives an MCG configuration, e.g. masterCellGroupConfig within an RRCReconfiguration message, containing the cell-A spCellConfig of IE SpCellConfig for the current PCell, and the configuration for the additional SpCells. Each of these configurations include an SpCell index, in this example, SpCell-A has index=1, SpCell-B has index=2 and SpCell-C has index=3. And, differently from what was shown in 5.1, each SpCell configuration has its own list of TCI states, where each TCI state may be associated to any of the configured SpCells. In the example above, the UE is configured overall with 7 TCI states:</p><p id="p-0311" num="0381">Dedicated Configuration for SpCell-A<ul id="ul0056" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0056-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0057" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0057-0001" num="0382">TCI-state ID=1 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1;</li>        <li id="ul0057-0002" num="0383">TCI-state ID=2 is associated to Pcell-B, hence it has an SpCell index=2;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0312" num="0384">Dedicated Configuration for SpCell-B<ul id="ul0058" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0058-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0059" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0059-0001" num="0385">TCI-state ID=3 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1;</li>        <li id="ul0059-0002" num="0386">TCI-state ID=4 is associated to Pcell-B, hence it has an SpCell index=2;</li>        <li id="ul0059-0003" num="0387">TCI-state ID=5 is associated to Pcell-C, hence it has an SpCell index=3;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0313" num="0388">Dedicated Configuration for SpCell-C<ul id="ul0060" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0060-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0061" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0061-0001" num="0389">TCI-state ID=6 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1;</li>        <li id="ul0061-0002" num="0390">TCI-state ID=7 is associated to Pcell-C, hence it has an SpCell index=3;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0314" num="0391">Notice that according to this variant the UE receives a list of TCI states per SpCell configuration. Hence, a change in SpCell, e.g. activation of a TCI state of a different PCell than the current one, implies that the UE starts to consider the new TCI state configuration as its current configuration. For example, if the UE is in PCell-A and receives the configuration of this example. Then, the UE receives a MAC CE activating one of the TCI states of the SpCell-A e.g. TCI-state ID=2, for cell B. The UE then considers cell B as active and apply the dedicated configuration associated to cell B, which comprises a new list of TCI states i.e. TCI-state ID=3 is associated to Pcell-A, hence it has an SpCell index=1; TCI-state ID=4 is associated to Pcell-B, hence it has an SpCell index=2; TCI-state ID=5 is associated to Pcell-C, hence it has an SpCell index=3.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0392">As in the case of an RRC based handover, the Additional SpCell configuration may also contain an SMTC configuration so the UE is able to perform measurements and find the target SpCell.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0393">Reply to MAC CE</p><p id="p-0317" num="0394">When UE receives the MAC CE for switching SpCell (i.e. activate an SpCell that is deactivated) the UE transmits an &#x201c;acknowledgement indication&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0395">In some variant embodiments, that acknowledgement indication is a random-access preamble that is transmitted to the target cell, i.e. to the newly activated SpCell, upon reception of the MAC CE as described in the method. That enables the target cell to identify an incoming UE via MAC CE, or in more general terms any lower layer signaling, inter-cell mobility. This may be applicable in the case of contention-free random-access resources, e.g. UE-specific preamble, possibly assigned per RS type and resource, like per SSB or SSB group, are allocated for that purpose.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0396">In some other variant embodiments, that acknowledgement indication is a MAC CE transmitted in the uplink to the target cell that contains a UE identifier enabling the target to identify an incoming UE via MAC CE, or in more general terms any lower layer signaling, inter-cell mobility. The UE identifier may be the UE's C-RNTI allocated in source, or a new C-RNTI associated to the newly activated SpCell where that new C-RNTI has been provided in the reconfiguration with sync configuration for that new target SpCell being activated with the MAC CE in the DL from the source. The solution also comprises the definition of a new C-RNTI for that purpose of inter-cell lower layer mobility.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0397">That procedure of sending the &#x201c;acknowledgement indication&#x201d; to the target SpCell upon reception of the MAC CE for lower layer inter-cell mobility may be part of a random-access procedure. For example, the UE may send a preamble, receive a random-access response and send that indication in the message 3, i.e., a MAC CE like message including the UE identity, e.g. C-RNTI. The procedure may not involve random access, e.g. depending on a configuration for a configured SpCell indicating that random access is not needed, so that upon receiving the MAC CE from source the UE assumes to be synchronized with the target SpCell and sends the &#x201c;acknowledgement indication&#x201d; e.g. MAC CE in the uplink including the UE identity.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0398">Embodiments of the method comprises the transmission of that &#x201c;acknowledgement indication&#x201d;, e.g. a MAC in the uplink with the UE's configuration, using the UE-specific configurations and cell-specific configurations associated to the new SpCell that the UE is accessing i.e. the SpCell indicated in the downlink MAC CE received from the source SpCell.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0399"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i></figref>shows an example of arrangements in the UE <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0400">The UE <b>120</b> may comprise an input and output interface configured to communicate with each other.
