With the advancement of wireless communication technology (e.g., 5<sup>th </sup>generation communication system (or the introduction of new radio (NR) communication system)), a use frequency band has increased more and more, and as a cell radius of a base station becomes very small, the number of RUs required to be installed has further increased. In a 5G communication system, the amount of transmitted data has increased by <b>10</b> times or more at most, and the transmission capacity of a wired network, which is transmitted via a fronthaul, has increased significantly. Due to these factors, the installation cost of a wired network in a 5G communication system may increase significantly. Therefore, in order to lower the transmission capacity of the wired network and reduce the installation cost of the wired network, techniques for lowering the transmission capacity of the fronthaul by transferring some functions of a modem of a DU to a RU have been proposed, and these techniques may be referred to as &#x201c;function split&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In order to reduce the burden on the DU, a method of extending a role of the RU, which is in charge of only an RF function, to some functions of a physical layer is considered. In this case, as the RU performs functions of a higher layer, the throughput of the RU increases, so that a transmission bandwidth in the fronthaul may increase, while delay time requirement constraint due to response processing decreases. As the RU performs the functions of a higher layer, the virtualization gain decreases and the size/weight/cost of the RU increases. In consideration of the trade-off of the advantages and disadvantages described above, it is required to implement an optimal function split.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, function splits in a physical layer below a MAC layer are shown.

In the case of an uplink (UL) that receives a signal from a terminal via the radio network, the base station may sequentially perform RF conversion, FFT transform/CP removal, digital beamforming (pre-combining), RE demapping, channel estimation, layer demapping, demodulation, and decoding/descrambling. Separation of uplink functions and downlink functions may be defined in various types by the necessity between vendors, discussion on specifications, etc. according to the trade-off described above.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A first function split <b>405</b> may be separation of an RF function and a PHY function. The first function split is that the PHY function in the RU is not substantially implemented, and may be referred to as, for example, option 8. A second function split <b>410</b> enables the RU to perform the PHY function that is to perform IFFT transform/CP insertion in the DL and FFT transform/CP removal in the UL, and enables the DU to perform the remaining PHY functions. For example, the second function split <b>410</b> may be referred to as option 7-1. A third function split <b>420</b><i>a </i>enables the RU to perform the PHY function that is to perform IFFT transform/CP insertion in the DL and FFT transform/CP removal and digital beamforming in the UL, and enables the DU to perform the remaining PHY functions. For example, the third function split <b>420</b><i>a </i>may be referred to as option 7-2x category A. A fourth function split <b>420</b><i>b </i>enables the RU to perform up to digital beamforming in both the DL and UL, and enables the DU to perform higher PHY functions after the digital beamforming For example, the fourth function split <b>420</b><i>b </i>may be referred to as option 7-2x category B. A fifth function split <b>425</b> enables the RU to perform up to RE mapping (or RE demapping) in both the DL and UL, and enables the DU to perform higher PHY functions after the RE mapping (or RE demapping). For example, the fifth function split <b>425</b> may be referred to as option 7-2. A sixth function split <b>430</b> enables the RU to perform up to modulation (or demodulation) in both the DL and UL, and enables the DU to perform higher PHY functions after the modulation (or demodulation). For example, the sixth function split <b>430</b> may be referred to as option 7-3. A seventh function split <b>440</b> enables the RU to perform up to encoding/scrambling (or decoding/descrambling) in both the DL and UL, and enables the DU to perform higher PHY functions after the encoding/scrambling (or decoding/descrambling).

The RU may store the channel information in the channel memory <b>521</b>. The channel information may be periodically updated. For example, the channel information may be &#x201c;ciIsample (Ci)&#x201d; or &#x201c;ciQsample (Cq)&#x201d; of section type 6, or may include a value obtained therefrom. Ci denotes an I value of complex channel information, and Cq denotes a Q value of the complex channel information. The regularization factor memory <b>523</b> may obtain information on a regularization parameter from the control message of section type 6.

Scheduling may be performed in a specified unit (e.g., slot unit). The scheduling information may be repeatedly provided to the regularization factor memory <b>523</b> for each slot. Information on the regularization parameter is transferred along with the channel information, and the RU may thus include the regularization factor memory <b>523</b> of the same level as the channel memory <b>521</b> which is a memory storing the channel information. The RU may acquire a corresponding channel value and regularization parameter value from each memory so as to calculate a beamforming weight, according to scheduling information (e.g., the control message of section type 5) transferred for each slot. Specifically, in order to calculate the beamforming weight, the RU may acquire the channel information from the channel memory <b>521</b> and may acquire the regularization parameter from the regularization factor memory <b>523</b>. The RU may calculate and acquire a beamforming weight (or multi-user (MU) weight) for MMSE (or ZFBF) for a current channel, based on the regularization parameter and the channel information.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0149">Although the beamforming weight needs to be calculated only when the UE is scheduled, the regularization factor memory <b>523</b> periodically acquires and stores channel information and a regularization parameter in addition to the scheduling information acquired each time when the UE is scheduled. When the UE is actually scheduled, a most recently transferred regularization parameter value should be used, and therefore the regularization factor memory <b>523</b> is required to store all transferred regularization parameter values even if the values are not actually used. Therefore, information on the regularization parameter, which is repeatedly stored even though the UE is not actually scheduled, causes a burden on the regularization factor memory <b>523</b>. In addition, if the channel information is updated for a relatively long period compared to the scheduling information updated in every slot (e.g., 0.5 ms), a probability that the regularization parameter of section type 6 does not correctly reflect a channel actually experienced by the UE increases.

Such a problem causes a larger error when a transfer period of the control message of section type 6 is longer, and this error causes an incorrect beamforming weight to be generated, resulting in a decrease in transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">Hereinafter, various embodiments describe a method for transferring a regularization parameter along with transferring of scheduling information, instead of periodically transferring a regularization parameter, in order to resolve the problems described via <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>.

For example, a section extension field including channel information (e.g., ciIsample and ciQsample) within a control message of section type 6 may be defined. The channel information in the section extension field may be configured for each frequency resource (e.g., a PRB, a PRB group, a bandwidth part (BWP), etc.) for each antenna. By considering capability of a terminal that an RU intends to serve and/or rank information of the terminal, the DU may acquire the number of required antennas among all antennas.

In some embodiments, the management message may include a parameter (hereinafter, a selection parameter) indicating selection of a transfer medium. The selection parameter may indicate whether to transfer a regularization parameter via a message of section type 6 of the control plane or to transfer the regularization parameter via a section extension field as before.
