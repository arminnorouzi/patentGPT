Such a device is also able to manage the temperature and distribution within the vehicle interior of the air flow created. Such a heating, ventilation and/or air-conditioning device comprises, inter alia, a fan comprising a fan impeller rotationally driven by an electric motor. The electric motor is notably an electronically switched electric motor controlled by a power supply module.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electronically switched electric motor, or brushless direct current motor, comprises a rotor and stator assembly, each of these components bearing electromagnetic elements whose interaction generates the movement of the rotor in relation to the stator and, ultimately, the movement of the fan impeller.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electric motor conventionally comprises an external rotor, an internal stator, fixed to a support for the electric motor. A cover is fixed to the support, to define a housing for receiving an electronic control board for the electric motor. Conventionally, this electronic board comprises various electronic elements which give the cover a bowl shape with at least one flat edge or rim, fixed to the motor support, and a substantially flat bottom. This cover is generally stamped in a thin sheet metal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it has been found that the rotation of the rotor can create mechanical excitation resulting in vibrations of the cover. The cover can thus produce a noise in a range of relatively high frequencies. Thus, when the fan is in operation, this noise can be annoying for the passengers of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present description is to propose such a mechanical assembly that does not have the aforementioned drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">More generally, the present description aims to propose a solution to the problem mentioned above, which can be implemented in the context of any mechanical assembly comprising at least one rotating element, a support for the rotating element and a cover fixed to the support for the rotating element.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To this end, a mechanical assembly for a vehicle, in particular a motor vehicle, is described, comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a rotating element,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a support for the rotating element, and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a cover fixed to the support for the rotating element, the cover comprising at least one edge fixed to the support for the rotating element and a bottom extending substantially in a plane, the bottom being covered at least in part by elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, advantageously, the elastomeric material makes it possible to attenuate the vibroacoustic emissions from the bottom of the cover, excited by the rotation of the rotating element, via the support.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the mechanical assembly comprises one or more of the following characteristics, taken alone or in combination:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the bottom is covered with elastomeric material, on its internal face, oriented toward the support for the rotating element, and/or on its external face, opposite to its internal face;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the elastomeric material forms at least one layer of substantially constant thickness, the thickness of the layer of elastomeric material preferably being greater than or equal to 1 mm and/or less than or equal to 3 mm, more preferably substantially equal to 2.5 mm;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">the elastomeric material covering at least part of the bottom of the cover is in one piece;<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">the elastomeric material is overmolded on the bottom, the bottom preferably having reliefs to improve the fixing of the elastomeric material overmolded on the bottom;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0018">the elastomeric material is SEBS, preferably having a hardness greater than or equal to 25 Shore, preferably 40 Shore, and/or less than or equal to 60 Shore;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0019">the mechanical assembly further comprises an electronic board for controlling the rotating element, the support for the rotating element preferably forming, with the cover, a housing for receiving the electronic board;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0020">the support for the rotating element has at least one projecting relief, in contact with the cover, in particular with the bottom of the cover, the projecting relief preferably passing through the electronic board, where appropriate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0021">the rotating element is an external rotor of an electric motor, a stator of the electric motor preferably being interposed between the external rotor and a cylindrical relief of the support for the rotating element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0022">the elastomeric material covering at least part of the bottom of the cover is divided into a plurality of pieces;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0023">the elastomeric material covers substantially the entire bottom of the cover;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0024">the elastomeric material is glued to the bottom, in particular by means of a cyanoacrylate glue;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0025">the support for the rotating element is made of aluminum alloy or plastics material filled with metal particles;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0026">the cover is made of aluminum alloy or plastics material filled with metal particles;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0027">the support comprises a substantially flat part extending in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the rotating element;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0028">the bottom of the cover is substantially parallel to the support and/or to the electronic control board;

The support <b>16</b> for the motor <b>14</b> is intended to allow the fixing of the fan device <b>10</b> in a motor vehicle, by limiting the transmission of the vibrations generated by the electric motor <b>14</b> and/or the fan impeller <b>12</b> in the motor vehicle and/or external stresses toward the electric motor <b>14</b> and/or the fan impeller <b>12</b>. The support <b>16</b> for the motor <b>14</b> may in particular comprise two coaxial rings, of axis A, interconnected by elastomeric material. In particular, the elastomeric material can form a decoupling ring between the inner ring and the outer ring. The inner ring may be intended to be fixed to the motor <b>14</b>. The outer ring may be intended to be fixed to a structural element, in particular of a vehicle ventilation installation. The elastomeric material is for example polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-butylene)-b-polystyrene or SEBS.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0043">The electric motor <b>14</b> here forms a mechanical assembly comprising a rotating element <b>18</b>, in this case the rotor <b>18</b> of the motor <b>14</b>, a support <b>20</b> for the rotor <b>18</b> and a cover <b>22</b>, fixed to the support <b>20</b> for the rotor <b>18</b>. Here, the cover <b>22</b> is fixed on the support <b>20</b> for the rotor <b>18</b> by means of screws <b>24</b>. Of course, other fixing means can be implemented to fix the cover <b>22</b> on the support <b>20</b> for the rotor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0044">The rotor <b>18</b> is here an external rotor. Thus, the stator <b>26</b> associated with the rotor <b>18</b> is arranged radially inside the rotor <b>18</b>. More precisely, the magnets <b>27</b> of the rotor <b>18</b> are radially outside with respect to the winding of the stator <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0045">The rotor <b>18</b> has the shape of a perforated cup <b>28</b>, fixed to a shaft <b>30</b>. The fan impeller <b>12</b> is here fixed directly on the shaft <b>30</b>. The magnets <b>27</b> of the rotor <b>18</b> are here fixed on the internal face of the cup <b>28</b>, on a cylindrical strip <b>32</b> formed by the cup <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0046">The support <b>20</b> is for example made of an aluminum alloy or a plastics material filled with metal particles.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0047">The support <b>20</b> for the rotor <b>18</b> here has a base <b>34</b>. The base <b>34</b> here extends wholly in a plane normal to the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. A substantially cylindrical relief <b>36</b> extends from the base <b>34</b>. Here, the relief <b>36</b> extends substantially in the direction of the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. The relief <b>36</b> is hollow. The relief <b>36</b> may in particular form one or two housings <b>38</b> each receiving a bearing ring, in particular a ball bearing, intended to guide the rotation of the shaft <b>30</b> with respect to the support <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0048">As is more particularly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the base <b>34</b> forms on its surface opposite to the cylindrical relief <b>36</b> a recess <b>40</b> receiving an electronic board <b>42</b> for controlling the motor <b>14</b>. The recess <b>40</b> may be surrounded by a projecting rim <b>41</b>. Various mechatronic components <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are fixed on the electronic board <b>42</b>. In particular, mechanical devices <b>44</b> make it possible to connect lugs integral with the windings of the stator <b>26</b> to the electronic board <b>42</b>. The power supply of these windings via these lugs can then allow the control of the electric motor <b>14</b>. The bulkier components <b>46</b>, in particular the capacitors, can also be fixed on the electronic board <b>42</b>, preferably near the edges of the electronic board <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0049">A connector <b>48</b> is also connected to the electronic board <b>42</b>. The connector <b>48</b> allows the electrical supply of the electronic board <b>42</b> and, consequently, of the motor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0050">Finally, the cover <b>22</b> is fixed on the base <b>34</b> of the support <b>20</b>. The cover <b>22</b> defines here, with the recess <b>40</b> in the base <b>34</b>, a housing for receiving the electronic board <b>42</b>. The cover <b>22</b> here comprises an edge <b>50</b>, which is substantially flat, extending in a plane normal to the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. The edge <b>50</b> has holes <b>51</b> allowing the fixing of the cover <b>22</b> on the base <b>34</b> of the support <b>20</b>, by means of screws <b>24</b>. The cover <b>22</b> also comprises a bottom <b>52</b>, remote from the edge <b>50</b>, in the direction of the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. The bottom <b>52</b> is here substantially flat. The bottom <b>52</b> extends substantially in a plane normal to the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. The bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> is here substantially parallel to the base <b>34</b> of the support <b>20</b>. Here, the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> is also substantially parallel to the electronic board <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0051">The bottom <b>52</b> is here almost completely covered with elastomeric material. The elastomeric material makes it possible to damp the oscillations of the bottom of the cover. This limits the vibroacoustic emissions from the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b>, excited by the rotation of the rotor <b>18</b> of the motor. This makes it possible in particular to reduce the sound emissions of the fan device <b>10</b>, in a range of audible frequencies, which are felt as unpleasant by the occupants of the vehicle equipped with the fan device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0052">The cover <b>22</b> is for example made of aluminum alloy or plastic filled with conductive particles, in particular plastic filled with metal particles.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0053">It should be noted here that the cover <b>22</b> shown comprises peripheral bosses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>. These bosses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> allow the reception of the bulkiest electronic devices <b>46</b>, in particular those which are tallest in the direction of the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. These bosses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are not considered here as forming part of the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b>. Indeed, it is understood that the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> is the central part of the cover <b>22</b>, as opposed to the edge <b>50</b>, which central part is substantially flat. The bosses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, on the contrary, due to their curved shape, have a limited tendency to vibrate under the effect of the excitation due to the rotation of the rotor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0054">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, in particular, the cover <b>22</b> also has a flat surface <b>53</b>, closer to the edge <b>50</b> than the bottom <b>52</b>, in the direction of the axis A of rotation of the motor <b>14</b>. This flat surface <b>53</b> is also not considered to form part of the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b>. In addition, this flat surface <b>53</b>, closer to the edge <b>50</b>, vibrates much less than the bottom <b>52</b>, so that the vibroacoustic emissions from this flat surface <b>53</b> are significantly reduced compared with the vibroacoustic emissions from the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0055">In practice, the bottom <b>52</b> is covered at least in part by elastomeric material. The bottom <b>52</b> can in particular be completely covered with elastomeric material, for a better effect of reducing the noise emitted by the cover <b>22</b>. However, depending on the particular shape of a cover <b>22</b>, for example, it may be chosen, on the contrary, to limit the surface of the bottom <b>52</b> covered by elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0056">The elastomeric material covering at least part of the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> can be in one piece or be divided into a plurality of separate pieces. A piece of elastomeric material in one piece is a priori easier to realize A realization in a plurality of separate pieces, however, allows better adaptation to complex reliefs of the cover <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0057">The elastomeric material covering the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> is for example polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-butylene)-b-polystyrene or SEBS.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0058">The elastomeric material may in particular have a hardness greater than or equal to 25 Shore, preferably 40 Shore, and/or less than or equal to 60 Shore.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0059">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the elastomeric material forms a layer <b>58</b>, of substantially constant thickness. The thickness of the layer <b>58</b> of elastomeric material is for example greater than or equal to 1 mm and/or less than or equal to 3 mm, more preferably substantially equal to 2.5 mm. A greater thickness of elastomeric material makes it possible a priori to obtain a greater reduction in the noise emitted by the cover <b>22</b>. However, a thinner layer <b>58</b> is less expensive and easier to realize.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0060">The elastomeric material, optionally in layer form, can in particular be overmolded on the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b>. In this case, it is particularly advantageous for the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover to have reliefs to improve the fixing of the elastomeric material overmolded on the bottom <b>52</b>. These reliefs can be of reduced dimensions, in particular of the order of a millimeter.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0061">Alternatively, the elastomeric material can be shaped prior to being fixed on the cover <b>22</b>. In this case, the piece(s) of elastomeric material may in particular be fixed by gluing. A cyanoacrylate glue can in particular be employed in this case.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover <b>22</b> may be covered with elastomeric material, on its external face. Alternatively or additionally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the bottom <b>52</b> of the cover is covered with elastomeric material on its internal face, opposite to the external face and oriented toward the support <b>20</b> of the rotor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0063">Finally, as can be seen in the figures, the cover <b>22</b> and the electronic board <b>42</b> can each comprise a through-opening <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> facing the shaft <b>30</b> of the rotor <b>18</b>. These openings <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> can allow the passage of a counter-support for the shaft <b>30</b>, allowing the fitting of the impeller <b>12</b> on the shaft <b>30</b>. The opening <b>60</b> in the cover can then be closed, in particular by means of a sticker. This makes it possible to protect the electronic board <b>42</b> against the humidity of the ambient air.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0064">The invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described with respect to the figures, and further embodiments will be clearly apparent to a person skilled in the art. In particular, the various examples may be combined, provided they are not contradictory.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0065">According to a variant, in particular, the support has at least one projecting relief, in contact with the cover, in particular with the bottom of the cover. In this case, the projecting relief can advantageously pass through the electronic control board. The projecting relief makes it possible to exert a mechanical stress on the bottom of the cover, which modifies its natural modes of vibration. The action of the elastomeric material is reinforced, and the level of vibrations is again reduced.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0066">Finally, the example of a motor vehicle ventilation device has been described. However, the invention applies to any mechanical assembly for a vehicle, in particular a motor vehicle, comprising a rotating element, a support for the rotating element and a cover fixed to the support for the rotating element. The cover then comprises at least one edge fixed to the support for the rotating element and a bottom extending substantially in a plane, the bottom being covered at least in part by elastomeric material.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
