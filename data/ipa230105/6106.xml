A mature and stable process for achieving the bonding between the chip <b>1</b> and the pads <b>21</b> is reflow soldering, the pins <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b> are usually made of gold, and the pads <b>21</b> to be bonded to the chip are usually made of copper. However, copper is easily oxidized, which adversely affects a bonding effect, and therefore an anti-oxidation layer <b>22</b> is usually formed on a surface of the copper. In addition, it is necessary to print a solder paste <b>4</b> on the pads before the reflow soldering, but the accuracy of the printing process is low, it is found that the yield is low in the case that a large number of chips are bonded through printing in a high PPI (Pixels Per Inch) display device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another process for bonding chips is eutectic welding. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a low-melting-point metal <b>5</b>, such as indium (In) and tin (Sn), is formed on the pads <b>21</b>. Under the effect of temperature and pressure, the low-melting-point metal <b>5</b> is melted and forms an In/Au alloy or Sn/Au alloy having a predetermined proportion with the material of the pins <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b>, such as gold (Au), thereby to achieve the bonding. However, a pressure value of 0.1 MPa to 0.5 MPa is required, and crack easily occurs in a chip having a size below 100 &#x3bc;m under the pressure. In addition, low-melting-point metal pads made of such as indium or tin are required to be formed through a plating process, which is difficult to be compatible with other processes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to address the above technical issues, a substrate, a method for forming the substrate, a display device and a method for forming the display device are provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure, so as to combine the advantages of the solder paste welding and the eutectic welding, thereby to provide a substrate bonding manner with high position accuracy, low temperature and without pressure, and having good compatibility with a process of a display device in the field of display.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the substrate is provided, including a base substrate <b>100</b>, at least two bonding pads <b>110</b> are arranged on the base substrate <b>100</b>, and at least two pins <b>210</b> are arranged on the electronic element <b>200</b>, a protective layer <b>120</b> is arranged at a side of the bonding pads <b>110</b> away from the base substrate <b>100</b>, and an opening region <b>121</b> is arranged in the protective layer <b>120</b> at each bonding pad <b>110</b>, to expose partial surface of the bonding pad <b>110</b>.

In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the protective layer <b>120</b> which only exposes the surface of each bonding pad is formed on each bonding pad <b>110</b> by using an insulating material, and a bonding material is directly deposited on the bonding pads to form the bonding combination layer <b>130</b>, so as to provide both may anti-oxidation and bonding effects though the bonding combination layer, thereby to reduce a probability that the bonding pads on the substrate are oxidized and save costs at the same time.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the eutectic welding process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the pins <b>11</b> of the chip <b>1</b> and the pads <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>2</b> are bonded to each other through metal diffusion of a metal material (such as gold, indium) at a high temperature and a high pressure. In the reflow soldering process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the low-melting-point alloy material (e.g., solder paste) is used for bonding the chip, bonding may be achieved in a well manner without applying a pressure. Therefore, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, through depositing the low-melting-point alloy material on the pads, it is able to enable the low-melting-point alloy material to be melted at a low-temperature condition and without applying a pressure, thereby to enable the low-melting-point alloy material and the pins of the chip to be bonded to each other quickly. In other words, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the bonding combination layer <b>130</b> is made of the low-melting-point alloy material, and the low-melting-point alloy material may be melted at a low temperature lower than the first predetermined temperature, and permeates into the materials of the bonding pads <b>110</b> and the pins <b>210</b>, so as to achieve the low-temperature bonding without applying a pressure.
