One known technique is phacoemulsification. This technique involves using high frequency ultrasound energy transmitted through a handpiece into a phacoemulsification needle to emulsify the affected tissue. To maintain the eye in a pressurized condition during surgery and to aid in the aspiration of the affected tissue, a saline fluid is introduced into the eye through the handpiece. Prior to surgery, the saline fluid is passed through the handpiece in a process known as priming. As the saline fluid flows through the handpiece during priming, air bubbles within the handpiece are evacuated. However, priming may not always remove all of the air from the handpiece (e.g., when the handpiece is not oriented correctly during priming, etc.) and this remaining air may cause problems if subsequently transmitted into the eye during surgery. For example, air bubbles in the saline fluid can cause visualization problems for the surgeon, can cause damage to corneal endothelial cells, and may cause an unwanted change in intra-ocular pressure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to phacoemulsification handpieces for ophthalmic surgery.

handpieces for ophthalmic surgery. Current phacoemulsification handpieces introduce a balanced salt solution (&#x201c;BSS&#x201d;) into the handpiece through a port that is oriented such that the BSS impinges directly on an ultrasonic horn included within handpiece. The direct impingement results in vortices/eddies within the flow of the BSS through the handpiece, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, which are inefficient at removing air from the handpiece during priming and may create additional air bubbles within the handpiece. Uniquely, the phacoemulsification handpieces of the present disclosure modify the positioning and orientation of the ports such that the BSS is introduced into the handpiece without direct impingement on the horn (e.g., to the side of the horn, approximately tangent to the inner wall of the handpiece, etc.), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. This creates an efficient and less turbulent fluid flow of the BSS within the housing. The resulting fluid flow more efficiently removes air from the housing during priming and minimizes the creation of air bubbles, which decreases the likelihood that trapped air would subsequently enter the eye during surgery.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. The description and specific examples included herein are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate an example embodiment of a phacoemulsification handpiece <b>100</b> (broadly, a handpiece) including one or more aspects of the present disclosure. In the illustrated embodiment, the handpiece <b>100</b> generally includes a housing <b>102</b> and a horn <b>104</b> positioned within the housing <b>102</b>. The horn <b>104</b> (e.g., an ultrasonic transducer horn) is coupled to a plurality of transducers <b>106</b> (e.g., a piezo-electric vibration stack) which are configured to ultrasonically vibrate the horn (and an unshown needle attached thereto) during surgery to emulsify affected tissue. As shown, the horn <b>104</b> is aligned (e.g., coaxial) with a central longitudinal axis <b>108</b> of the handpiece <b>100</b>, the central longitudinal axis <b>108</b> extending from a distal end <b>109</b> of the handpiece <b>100</b> through a proximal end <b>111</b> of the handpiece <b>100</b>. It is also noted that handpiece <b>100</b> and horn <b>104</b> may not be axially symmetric, such as in designs intended to create other than longitudinal vibration.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The horn <b>104</b> is positioned within a cavity <b>110</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. The cavity <b>110</b> is located at the distal end <b>109</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. The cavity <b>110</b> is defined, in part, by an inner wall <b>112</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the diameter of the cavity <b>110</b> is larger at the proximal end of the cavity <b>110</b> than the diameter of the cavity <b>110</b> at the distal end of the cavity <b>110</b>. As shown, the inner wall <b>112</b> may define a smooth transition between the larger diameter at the proximal end of the cavity <b>110</b> to the smaller diameter at the distal end of the cavity <b>110</b> (e.g., does not include stepped reductions in diameter). However, in other embodiments, the inner wall <b>112</b> may include other geometries, such as those including stepped reductions in diameter. Additionally, to protect the transducers <b>106</b> and other electronics included in the housing <b>102</b> of the handpiece <b>100</b>, the handpiece <b>100</b> also includes a seal <b>114</b> (e.g., an o-ring) positioned around the horn <b>104</b> (e.g., at a base of the horn <b>104</b>) to fluidly seal the transducers <b>106</b> and other electronics from fluid that may be present in the cavity <b>110</b> (e.g., during priming, during surgery, etc.).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The handpiece <b>100</b> also includes an irrigation line <b>116</b> that may be positioned external to the housing <b>102</b>, as shown, or may be found within housing <b>102</b>. Although not shown, the irrigation line <b>116</b> is coupled to a supply (e.g., a bag, a bottle, etc.) of irrigation fluid (e.g., a saline fluid, BSS, etc.). The irrigation fluid is directed into the cavity <b>110</b> from the irrigation line <b>116</b> via a port <b>118</b>, where the port <b>118</b> is located towards the proximal end of the cavity <b>110</b>. As shown, the inner wall <b>112</b> of the cavity <b>110</b> is parallel to the central longitudinal axis <b>108</b> at the location of the port <b>118</b> (e.g., at the proximal end of the cavity <b>110</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, the port <b>118</b> does not extend into the cavity <b>110</b> (e.g., the end of the port <b>118</b> is aligned with the inner wall <b>112</b> of the housing <b>102</b>). In other embodiments, the port <b>118</b> may extend at least partially into the cavity <b>110</b> (e.g., the port <b>118</b> includes a chamfered end which partially extends into the cavity to direct the irrigation fluid into the cavity <b>110</b>, etc.) (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the port <b>118</b> is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis <b>108</b> such that the irrigation fluid is directed into the cavity <b>110</b> at an infusion angle &#x3b1; (i.e., the angle at which the irrigation fluid enters the cavity with respect to the central axis <b>108</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the infusion angle &#x3b1; of the port <b>118</b> is about forty-five degrees. However, in other embodiments, the infusion angle &#x3b1; may be greater or lesser (e.g., 30 degrees, 90 degrees, etc.), to optimize the flow of the irrigation fluid into and/or through the cavity <b>110</b>. In some respects, depending on the design, port <b>118</b> may be considered the distal end of irrigation line <b>116</b>, a passage formed through housing <b>102</b> into cavity <b>110</b>, or a combination of both. An intention of the design is to have the irrigation fluid flow tangential to the inner wall <b>112</b> to create a swirling, non-turbulent flow.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, the irrigation line <b>116</b> and the port <b>118</b> are offset from the axis <b>108</b> (e.g., are not centered on the handpiece <b>100</b>). In particular, the irrigation line <b>116</b> and the port <b>118</b> are shifted laterally from the axis <b>108</b> (e.g., laterally offset from the horn <b>104</b>). The positioning of the offset port <b>118</b> both laterally and longitudinally may be selected in combination with the design of the cavity <b>110</b> to provide optimal, smooth fluid flow. In this way, when the irrigation fluid flows through the handpiece <b>100</b> (e.g., into the cavity <b>110</b>), the irrigation fluid does not directly impinge the horn <b>104</b>. Instead, the port <b>118</b> directs the irrigation fluid into the cavity <b>110</b> to the side of the horn <b>104</b> (e.g., lateral to the horn <b>104</b>). In this way, the flow of the irrigation fluid generally revolves around the horn <b>104</b> (e.g., in a vortex-like flow) as the irrigation fluid flows through the cavity <b>110</b> (similar to the flow depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). In other embodiments, the irrigation line <b>116</b> and the port <b>118</b> may be centered on the handpiece <b>100</b> (e.g., not laterally offset), but nonetheless direct the irrigation fluid into the cavity to the side of the horn <b>104</b>, for example, by angling the port <b>114</b> away from the horn <b>104</b> (e.g., at an offset angle) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref> illustrate another example embodiment of a phacoemulsification handpiece <b>200</b> including one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The handpiece <b>200</b> of this embodiment is substantially similar to the handpiece <b>100</b> previously described and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. For example, the handpiece <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>202</b> and a horn <b>204</b> (e.g., an ultrasonic transducer horn) that is positioned within a cavity <b>210</b> of the housing <b>202</b> and is coaxial with a central longitudinal axis <b>208</b> of the handpiece <b>200</b>. The cavity <b>210</b> is positioned at a distal end of the housing <b>202</b> and is defined, in part, by an inner wall <b>212</b> of the housing <b>202</b> The handpiece <b>200</b> also includes an irrigation line <b>216</b> that is coupled to a supply of irrigation fluid (e.g., a saline fluid, BSS, etc.) and a port <b>218</b> coupled between the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the cavity <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, both the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the port <b>218</b> are axially aligned (e.g., coaxial) with the central longitudinal axis <b>208</b> of the handpiece <b>200</b>. As such, rather than laterally offsetting the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the port <b>218</b> from the central longitudinal axis <b>208</b>, the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the port <b>218</b> are coaxial with the axis <b>208</b>, and the port <b>218</b> is instead angled (e.g., laterally angled) by offset angle (<b>3</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>), such that the irrigation fluid is directed into the cavity <b>210</b> to the side of the horn <b>204</b> (and generally tangent to the inner wall <b>212</b> of the housing <b>202</b>). Angling the port <b>218</b> creates a flow of irrigation fluid through the cavity <b>208</b> that is similar to the flow created by offsetting the port (e.g., offset port <b>118</b>). For example, the flow of the irrigation fluid generally revolves around the horn <b>204</b> (e.g., in a vortex-like flow) as the irrigation fluid flows through the cavity <b>210</b> (similar to the flow depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), whereby trapped air is more reliably removed from the cavity <b>210</b> during priming of the handpiece <b>200</b>. In particular, the flow provided by the angled port <b>218</b> does not directly impinge on the horn <b>204</b>, resulting in a less turbulent flow, which creates fewer air bubbles. Moreover, centrally locating the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the port <b>218</b> (e.g., axially aligned with the axis <b>208</b>, not laterally offset, etc.) may also result in a more ergonomic grip for a user of the handpiece <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the port may be angled at an offset angle (<b>3</b> (e.g., similar to port <b>218</b>) and is also laterally offset from the horn (e.g., similar to port <b>118</b>). In such embodiments, the irrigation line may also be laterally offset from the horn and central longitudinal axis (e.g., similar to irrigation line <b>116</b>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the port <b>218</b> is angled with respect to a vertical axis <b>220</b> of the handpiece <b>200</b> such that the irrigation fluid is directed into the cavity <b>210</b> at an offset angle (<b>3</b> (i.e., the angle at which the irrigation fluid enters the cavity with respect to the vertical axis <b>220</b>). The optimum offset angle will depend on the cavity geometry. It is also noted that the offset can be either to either side of the cavity and is not limited to the examples shown. The vertical axis <b>220</b> is perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis <b>208</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) and, because the irrigation line <b>216</b> is not laterally offset in this embodiment, the vertical axis <b>220</b> generally passes through the irrigation line <b>216</b> and the horn <b>204</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the offset angle &#x3b2; enables the irrigation fluid to enter the cavity <b>210</b> to the side of the horn <b>204</b> (e.g., without directly impinging on the horn <b>204</b>), which assists in removing more air during priming regardless of orientation of the handpiece <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to being angled with respect to the vertical axis <b>220</b> of the handpiece <b>200</b> (e.g., by offset angle &#x3b2;), the port <b>218</b> is also angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis <b>208</b> of the handpiece <b>200</b> at an infusion angle &#x3b1; (e.g., similar to port <b>118</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the port <b>218</b> is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis <b>208</b> such that the irrigation fluid is directed into the cavity <b>110</b> at an infusion angle &#x3b1;. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the infusion angle &#x3b1; of the port <b>218</b> is forty-five degrees. However, in other embodiments, the infusion angle &#x3b1; may be greater or lesser (e.g., 30 degrees, 90 degrees, etc.), to optimize the flow of the irrigation fluid into and/or through the cavity <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>13</b></figref> illustrate another example embodiment of a phacoemulsification handpiece <b>300</b> including one or more aspects of the present disclosure.

For example, the handpiece <b>300</b> includes a housing <b>302</b> and a horn <b>304</b> (e.g., an ultrasonic transducer horn) that is positioned within a cavity <b>310</b> of the housing <b>302</b> and is coaxial with a central longitudinal axis <b>308</b> of the handpiece <b>300</b>.

Similar to the handpiece <b>100</b>, the irrigation line <b>316</b> and the port <b>318</b> of the handpiece <b>300</b> are laterally offset from the central longitudinal axis <b>308</b> to direct the irrigation fluid away from the horn <b>304</b> (e.g., to the side of the horn <b>304</b>, without direct impingement on the horn <b>304</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the port <b>318</b> is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis <b>308</b> at an infusion angle &#x3b1; of 90 degrees (e.g., at a right angle with respect to the inner wall <b>312</b> of the cavity <b>310</b>, etc.). Similar to port <b>118</b> and port <b>218</b>, port <b>318</b> is positioned at the proximal end of the cavity <b>310</b>. Angling the port <b>318</b> at an infusion angle &#x3b1; of 90 degrees may help ensure that the flow of irrigation fluid within the cavity <b>310</b> generally flows from the proximal end of the cavity <b>310</b> to the distal end of the cavity <b>310</b> (e.g., without backtracking towards the proximal end of the cavity <b>310</b>). This helps reduce any turbulence in the flow that may occur if the irrigation fluid flows from the port <b>318</b> towards the proximal end of the cavity <b>310</b> (e.g., when the infusion angle &#x3b1; is less than 90 degrees) and aids evacuation of air from cavity <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref> illustrate another example embodiment of a phacoemulsification handpiece <b>400</b> including one or more aspects of the present disclosure. The handpiece <b>400</b> of this embodiment is substantially similar to the handpiece <b>300</b> previously described and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. For example, the handpiece <b>400</b> includes a housing <b>402</b> and a horn <b>404</b> (e.g., an ultrasonic transducer horn) that is positioned within a cavity <b>410</b> of the housing <b>402</b> and is coaxial with a central longitudinal axis <b>408</b> of the handpiece <b>400</b>. The cavity <b>410</b> is positioned at a distal end of the housing <b>402</b> and is defined, in part, by an inner wall <b>412</b> of the housing <b>402</b>. The handpiece <b>400</b> also includes an irrigation line <b>416</b> that is coupled to a supply of irrigation fluid (e.g., a saline fluid, BSS, etc.) and a port <b>418</b> coupled between the irrigation line <b>416</b> and the cavity <b>410</b>. Similar to handpiece <b>100</b> and handpiece <b>300</b>, the irrigation line <b>416</b> and the port <b>418</b> of the handpiece <b>400</b> are laterally offset from the central longitudinal axis <b>408</b> to direct the irrigation fluid away from the horn <b>404</b> (e.g., to the side of the horn <b>304</b>, without direct impingement on the horn <b>404</b>, etc.). Similar to the handpiece <b>300</b>, the port <b>418</b> is angled at an infusion angle &#x3b1; of 90 degrees, although in other embodiments, the infusion angle may be different (e.g., less than 90 degrees, 45 degrees, etc.).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment, the port <b>418</b> partially extends into the cavity <b>410</b> and the end <b>422</b> of the port <b>418</b> is angled (e.g., chamfered). Rather having the end <b>422</b> of the port be squared off (e.g., similar to port <b>118</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>318</b>, etc.), the end <b>422</b> of the port <b>418</b> is angled, such that the portion of the end <b>422</b> that is closer to the horn <b>404</b> is longer than the portion of the end <b>422</b> that is away from the horn <b>404</b>. Angling (e.g., chamfering) the end <b>422</b> of the port <b>418</b> in this way further ensures that the irrigation fluid entering the cavity <b>410</b> via the port <b>418</b> does so without impinging on the horn <b>404</b>. In particular, the longer portion of the end <b>422</b> of the port <b>418</b> directs the irrigation fluid away from the horn <b>404</b> and towards the inner wall <b>412</b> of the cavity <b>410</b>, such that the irrigation fluid flows generally along (e.g., tangent to) the inner wall of the cavity <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Phacoemulsification handpieces of the present disclosure may allow for efficient priming of the handpiece, such that fewer air bubbles are generated by the flow of irrigation fluid (e.g., saline fluid, BSS, etc.) through the handpiece and that more air is removed from the handpiece during priming (e.g., even if the handpiece is not held in the proper orientation during priming (e.g., in a non-vertical or upright position)). The phacoemulsification handpieces of the present disclosure offset the flow of irrigation fluid into the cavity by either laterally offsetting the irrigation port or laterally angling the irrigation port, such that the irrigation fluid does not collide with (e.g., impinge upon) the horn when entering the cavity. Doing so results in a less turbulent flow through the cavity and enables efficient and improved priming of the phacoemulsification handpieces.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art.
