Once the light beams have been coupled into the waveguide, the light beams are &#x201c;guided&#x201d; through the substrate, typically by multiple instances of total internal reflection (TIR), to then be directed out of the waveguide by an output optical coupling (i.e., an &#x201c;outcoupler&#x201d;), which can also take the form of an optical grating. The light beams projected from the waveguide overlap at an eye relief distance from the waveguide forming an exit pupil within which a virtual image generated by the image source can be viewed by the user of the HMD.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some HMDs, the incoupler is an optical grating, which can be produced by physically forming grooves or other surface features on a surface of a waveguide, or volume features within the waveguide substrate. The overall efficiency of a grating depends on various application-specific parameters such as wavelength, polarization, and angle of incidence of the incoming light. The efficiency of a grating is also influenced by the grating design parameters, such as the distance between adjacent grating features, grating width, thickness of the grating region, and the angle the gratings form with the substrate. Also in some HMDs, an optical coating, such as an anti-reflective coating, is applied to prevent reflection from a lens of the HMD. However, due to issues with grating and coating codesigns, either the see-through performance of the display or the coating performance is often sacrificed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure may be better understood, and its numerous features and advantages made apparent to those skilled in the art by referencing the accompanying drawings.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">High-quality anti-reflection coatings help to minimize the visibility of flashes of reflection from a waveguide. Typically, anti-reflection coatings are applied by depositing layers of thin-films on a waveguide substrate of the waveguide. The number of layers, layer material, and layer thickness determines the reflection properties. These layers are also typically deposited across an entirety of the waveguide, across an incoupler, an outcoupler, and an exit pupil expander and areas in-between these components. A problem with such anti-reflection coating across the entirety of the waveguide, including the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander, is that anti-reflective performance of waveguides is compromised to allow for better display metrics, such as efficiency and uniformity.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> illustrate techniques for decoupling the gratings of the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander from an anti-reflection coating. In some embodiments, the anti-reflection coating is disposed in areas between the areas in which the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander are disposed. Thus, instead of having to arrive at a compromise for the anti-reflection coating, the anti-reflection coating can be optimized as not having to take into consideration anti-reflection properties of the gratings of the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander. Grating optimization can be performed for display and coating optimization for performance of the anti-reflection coating. This solution also improves upon typical anti-reflection coatings for waveguide gratings as it also takes advantage of the anti-reflection properties that gratings possess, such as their ability to act as a quarterwave stack depending on the fill factors selected.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example display system <b>100</b> having a waveguide with selective placement of anti-reflection coatings.

It should be noted that while an example form factor is depicted, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments the display system <b>100</b> may have a different shape and appearance from the eyeglasses frame depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One or both of the lens elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are used by the display system <b>100</b> to provide an augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR) display in which rendered graphical content can be superimposed over or otherwise provided in conjunction with a real-world view as perceived by the user through the lens elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. For example, laser light used to form a perceptible image or series of images may be projected by a laser projector of the display system <b>100</b> onto the eye of the user via a series of optical elements, such as a waveguide formed at least partially in the corresponding lens element, one or more scan mirrors, and one or more optical relays. One or both of the lens elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> thus include at least a portion of a waveguide that routes display light received by an incoupler, or multiple incouplers, of the waveguide to an outcoupler of the waveguide, which outputs the display light toward an eye of a user of the display system <b>100</b>. The display light is modulated and projected onto the eye of the user such that the user perceives the display light as an image. In addition, each of the lens elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> is sufficiently transparent to allow a user to see through the lens elements to provide a field of view of the user's real-world environment such that the image appears superimposed over at least a portion of the real-world environment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An anti-reflection coating is applied to the waveguide of the display system <b>100</b>. Specifically, this anti-reflection coating is disposed in areas outside of areas in which the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander are disposed. This disposition of the anti-reflection coating allows for separate optimization of gratings of the incoupler, the outcoupler, and the exit pupil expander, from optimization of the anti-reflection coating.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the projector is a matrix-based projector, a scanning laser projector, or any combination of a modulative light source such as a laser or one or more LEDs and a dynamic reflector mechanism such as one or more dynamic scanners or digital light processors. In some embodiments, the projector includes multiple laser diodes (e.g., a red laser diode, a green laser diode, and/or a blue laser diode) and at least one scan mirror (e.g., two one-dimensional scan mirrors, which may be micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based or piezo-based). The projector is communicatively coupled to the controller and a non-transitory processor-readable storage medium or memory storing processor-executable instructions and other data that, when executed by the controller, cause the controller to control the operation of the projector. In some embodiments, the controller controls a scan area size and scan area location for the projector and is communicatively coupled to a processor (not shown) that generates content to be displayed at the display system <b>100</b>. The projector scans light over a variable area, designated the FOV area <b>106</b>, of the display system <b>100</b>. The scan area size corresponds to the size of the FOV area <b>106</b>, and the scan area location corresponds to a region of one of the lens elements <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> at which the FOV area <b>106</b> is visible to the user. Generally, it is desirable for a display to have a wide FOV to accommodate the outcoupling of light across a wide range of angles. Herein, the range of different user eye positions that will be able to see the display is referred to as the eyebox of the display.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the projector routes light via first and second scan mirrors, an optical relay disposed between the first and second scan mirrors, and a waveguide disposed at the output of the second scan mirror. In some embodiments, at least a portion of an outcoupler of the waveguide may overlap the FOV area <b>106</b>. These aspects are described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a laser projection system <b>200</b> that projects laser light representing images onto the eye <b>216</b> of a user via a waveguide, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The laser projection system <b>200</b> includes an optical engine <b>202</b>, an optical scanner <b>220</b>, and a waveguide <b>212</b>.

In some embodiments, the optical engine <b>202</b> is coupled to a controller or driver (not shown), which controls the timing of emission of laser light from the laser light sources of the optical engine <b>202</b> (e.g., in accordance with instructions received by the controller or driver from a computer processor coupled thereto) to modulate the laser light <b>218</b> to be perceived as images when output to the retina of the eye <b>216</b> of the user.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The optical scanner <b>220</b> includes a first scan mirror <b>204</b>, a second scan mirror <b>206</b>, and an optical relay <b>208</b>. One or both of the scan mirrors <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> may be MEMS mirrors, in some embodiments. For example, the scan mirror <b>204</b> and the scan mirror <b>206</b> are MEMS mirrors that are driven by respective actuation voltages to oscillate during active operation of the laser projection system <b>200</b>, causing the scan mirrors <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> to scan the laser light <b>218</b>. Oscillation of the scan mirror <b>204</b> causes laser light <b>218</b> output by the optical engine <b>202</b> to be scanned through the optical relay <b>208</b> and across a surface of the second scan mirror <b>206</b>. The second scan mirror <b>206</b> scans the laser light <b>218</b> received from the scan mirror <b>204</b> toward an incoupler <b>210</b> of the waveguide <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the scan mirror <b>204</b> oscillates along a first scanning axis, such that the laser light <b>218</b> is scanned in only one dimension (i.e., in a line) across the surface of the second scan mirror <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, the scan mirror <b>206</b> oscillates along a second scan axis that is perpendicular to the first scan axis.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The waveguide <b>212</b> of the laser projection system <b>200</b> includes the incoupler <b>210</b> and the outcoupler <b>214</b>. The term &#x201c;waveguide,&#x201d; as used herein, will be understood to mean a combiner using total internal reflection (TIR), or via a combination of TIR, specialized filters, and/or reflective surfaces, to transfer light from an incoupler to an outcoupler. For display applications, the light may be a collimated image, and the waveguide transfers and replicates the collimated image to the eye. In general, the terms &#x201c;incoupler&#x201d; and &#x201c;outcoupler&#x201d; will be understood to refer to any type of optical grating structure, including, but not limited to, diffraction gratings, slanted gratings, blazed gratings, holograms, holographic optical elements (e.g., optical elements using one or more holograms), volume diffraction gratings, volume holograms, surface relief diffraction gratings, and/or surface relief holograms. In some embodiments, a given incoupler or outcoupler is configured as a transmissive diffraction grating that causes the incoupler or outcoupler to transmit light and to apply designed optical function(s) to the light during the transmission. In some embodiments, a given incoupler or outcoupler is a reflective diffraction grating that causes the incoupler or outcoupler to reflect light and to apply designed optical function(s) to the light during the reflection. In the present example, the laser light <b>218</b> received at the incoupler <b>210</b> is relayed to the outcoupler <b>214</b> via the waveguide <b>212</b> using TIR.

The incoupler <b>210</b> may be defined by a small dimension (i.e., width) and a long dimension (i.e., length). In a configuration, the optical relay <b>208</b> is a line-scan optical relay that receives the laser light <b>218</b> scanned in a first dimension by the first scan mirror (e.g., the first dimension corresponding to the small dimension of the incoupler <b>210</b>), routes the laser light <b>218</b> to the second scan mirror <b>206</b>, and introduces a convergence to the laser light <b>218</b> in the first dimension. The second scan mirror <b>206</b> receives the converging laser light <b>218</b> and scans the laser light <b>218</b> in a second dimension, the second dimension corresponding to the long dimension of the incoupler <b>210</b> of the waveguide <b>212</b>. The second scan mirror may cause the laser light <b>218</b> to converge to a focal line along the second dimension. In some embodiments, the incoupler <b>210</b> is positioned at or near the focal line downstream from the second scan mirror <b>206</b> such that the second scan mirror <b>206</b> scans the laser light <b>218</b> as a line over the incoupler <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example of light propagation within the waveguide <b>212</b> of the laser projection system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.
