More recently, catheters have been used for replacement of heart valves, in particular, the aortic valve in a procedure sometimes known as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). TAVI is now the principal therapeutic option in patients with severe aortic stenosis deemed inoperable or at high surgical risk. Over 300,000 TAVI procedures were performed worldwide in 2018, and the mortality benefits of TAVI in inoperable and high-risk surgical patients have been recognised. However, the benefit of TAVI is attenuated by the occurrence of major disabling stroke which is associated with increased mortality and in the short term reduced quality of life. During TAVI, extensive manipulation of the calcified native valve and aortic wall takes place using large-sized catheters and rigid delivery systems. Subsequently, balloon valvuloplasty, positioning and implanting of the valve, and possibly post-dilation, takes place. Consequently, dislodgement and embolization of aortic debris and crushed calcified native valves seems inevitable and can provoke stroke by reaching brain vessels.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cerebral embolic protection devices have been developed to reduce the risk of stroke by providing an efficient protection of the entire brain. To perform well, the device requires to have a minimum filtering porosity, a good anchoring on the vessel without damaging the vessel and a good stability by withstanding the blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current embolic protection devices on the market/in development include the Boston Scientific Sentinel (RTM) device, the Keystone Heart TriGUARD 3&#x2122; device, the Edwards Life Sciences Embrella device, the Emboline Emboliner&#x2122; device, and the Innovative Cardiovascular Solutions Emblok&#x2122; system.

delivery catheter system generally designated <b>10</b> located within the aorta <b>12</b> of a patient. The features of the aorta include the ascending aorta <b>14</b>, the arch of aorta <b>16</b>, the descending aorta <b>18</b>, the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. Not shown is the aortic valve which is to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The delivery catheter system <b>10</b> includes catheter <b>30</b> and an embolic filter <b>32</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the catheter may be considered to be a TAVI delivery catheter, and the embodiment is described with reference to a TAVI procedure. It will be appreciated, however, that in alternative embodiments the catheter may be used for different valve replacement procedures, or may be used in the placement of an intravascular stent.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> may, by way of illustrative example only, correspond to the Medtronic EnVeo PRO&#x2122; delivery catheter system. The TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> includes an elongate catheter body <b>31</b> having a distal tip <b>33</b>. The TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> further includes a capsule (not shown) containing a replacement valve. The filter <b>32</b> is provided circumferentially around an outer surface of the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and extends across the annulus defined the between the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the wall <b>34</b> of the ascending aorta <b>14</b>. The filter <b>32</b> is configured so as to be able to conform to the wall <b>34</b> of the ascending aorta <b>14</b> and thus provide required sealing characteristics against the wall of ascending aorta <b>14</b>. The filter <b>32</b> is provided with a high porosity membrane that doesn't restrict blood flow but at the same time provides the desired filtering characteristics to capture any debris <b>36</b> that may be dislodged by the TAVI procedure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiment shown, the filter <b>32</b> is positioned in the ascending aorta <b>14</b> downstream of the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and upstream of the arch of aorta <b>16</b>. Any debris <b>36</b> that may be dislodged by the TAVI procedure is thus captured by the filter <b>32</b> and prevented from reaching and entering the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. It will be appreciated that the filter <b>32</b> may alternatively be positioned in the arch of the aorta <b>14</b> and downstream of the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and upstream of the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. In some arrangements, it will be appreciated that the filter <b>32</b> may be arranged downstream of the left and right coronary arteries <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> in the arch of the aorta <b>14</b> so as to cover the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the filter <b>32</b> in a deployed state. The filter <b>32</b> is initially provided in an un-deployed or collapsed state. Although not illustrated, TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the collapsed filter <b>32</b> may be covered by an external catheter. The external catheter acts as a sheath or sleeve that maintains the filter <b>32</b> in the collapsed state during advancement of the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> through the vasculature of the patient. Upon delivery of the replacement valve, i.e. upon positioning of the replacement valve in the desired location within the aorta <b>12</b> of a patient, the filter <b>32</b> can be moved to the deployed state. This may be achieved by, for example, by relative movement between the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the external catheter in a first direction so as to uncover the filter <b>32</b>. The filter <b>32</b> may then move from the collapsed state to the deployed state, for example via shape memory material portions of the filter <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The embolic filter <b>32</b> is formed from a support frame <b>38</b>. The support frame <b>38</b> may be formed from a shape memory material, for example a shape memory alloy or shape memory polymer. In each of the embodiments discussed herein, the shape memory material is nitinol, but it will be appreciated that any suitable shape memory material may be used. The filter <b>32</b> also includes a porous polymeric membrane <b>40</b> covering the support frame. The polymeric membrane <b>40</b> may comprise a biocompatible porous fabric having a pore size of between 100 and 200 nanometers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With the filter <b>32</b> deployed and extending across the aforementioned annulus between the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the wall <b>34</b> of the ascending aorta <b>14</b>, the TAVI procedure can be conducted. As noted above, any debris <b>36</b> that is be dislodged by the TAVI procedure is thus captured by the filter <b>32</b> and prevented from reaching and entering the brachiocephalic artery <b>24</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>26</b> and/or the left subclavian artery <b>28</b>. Once the TAVI procedure has been completed, and prior to the withdrawal of the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> from the vasculature of the patient, the filter <b>32</b> is retrieved or moved back to its un-deployed or collapsed state from its deployed state while still retaining any debris <b>36</b> that may have been collected. Movement of the filter <b>32</b> back to its un-deployed or collapsed state from its deployed state may be achieved by, for example manipulation or movement of the sheath or sleeve back to its initial position.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the TAVI procedure has been completed, and prior to the withdrawal of the delivery catheter <b>30</b> from the vasculature of the patient, the filter <b>32</b> is retrieved while still retaining any debris <b>36</b> that may have been collected. Put another way, the filter <b>32</b> is moved back to its un-deployed or collapsed state from its deployed state while still retaining any debris <b>36</b> that may have been collected. Movement of the filter <b>32</b> back to its un-deployed or collapsed state from its deployed state may be achieved by relative movement between the TAVI delivery catheter <b>30</b> and the external catheter in a second direction, opposite to the first direction.

The resilient fastener <b>56</b> is urged into engagement with the body of the capsule <b>35</b> in a first, e.g. retracted, position. Urging of the resilient fastener <b>56</b> into engagement with the capsule <b>35</b> works to releasably attach the embolic filter <b>32</b> to the capsule <b>35</b>. In a second, e.g. advanced, position, the resilient fastener <b>56</b> expands into an internal groove <b>58</b> on the catheter <b>30</b>. This results in the resilient fastener <b>56</b> disengaging from the capsule <b>35</b>. At this point the embolic filter <b>32</b> is completely deployed. Disengaging or decoupling of the resilient fastener <b>56</b> (i.e. the embolic filter <b>32</b>) when the embolic filter <b>32</b> is deployed enables the capsule <b>35</b> to be advanced independently of the embolic filter <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the capsule <b>35</b> is retracted, it abuts against the resilient fastener <b>56</b>.

The abutment surface <b>60</b> moves the resilient fastener <b>56</b> along a tapered surface <b>62</b> of the internal groove <b>58</b> so as to be urged into engagement with the capsule <b>35</b>. This works to releasably attach the embolic filter <b>32</b> to the capsule <b>35</b>.
