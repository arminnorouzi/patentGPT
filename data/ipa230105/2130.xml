More particularly, the present invention relates to a barrier film comprising a barrier coat layer, an inorganic oxide deposition layer, and a substrate layer, in this order. In addition, the present invention relates to a packaging material comprising the barrier film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field that requires a moist heat sterilization treatment (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;retort treatment&#x201d;) of foods, medicines, etc., in order to suppress the alteration of contents and maintain their functions and properties, it has been conventionally necessary to prevent an effect caused by oxygen, water vapor and another gas which can alter the contents. These gases can permeate a packaging material. The packaging material in this field has been required to have gas barrier properties to block these gases. A film of a vinylidene chloride resin, which is excellent in gas barrier property among polymers, or a film coated with these resins have been used. However, their gas barrier properties are greatly affected by temperature and humidity, and there has been a technical problem that they cannot meet the demand for high gas barrier properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, the field that requires the retort treatment of foods, medicines, etc. needs a barrier film capable of stably exhibiting higher barrier properties unaffected by temperature, humidity, etc., in order to prevent alteration of contents and maintain their functions and properties. Thus, a barrier film formed by laminating a vapor deposition layer of silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, etc., and a membrane layer having barrier properties has been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Patent Document 1 proposes a gas barrier lamination film comprising: a gas barrier deposition layer provided on the resin substrate and a gas barrier coating layer provided on the gas barrier deposition layer. The gas barrier deposition layer mainly contains an inorganic compound. The bas barrier coating layer is obtained by applying, to the gas barrier deposition layer, an application liquid and by drying the application liquid. The application liquid contains a specific silicon compound, its hydrolysis product, and a water soluble polymer having a hydroxyl group.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: WO2004-048081</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventors noticed that although a packaging material using the gas barrier lamination film proposed by Patent Document 1 has excellent gas barrier properties after a retort treatment, the gas barrier properties deteriorate after a Gelboflex test. As a result of conducted extensive studies, the inventors found that, when a gas barrier coating layer (barrier coat layer) has a plastic deformation rate and a hardness, which are in specific numerical ranges, the bas barrier coating layer can surely have high gas barrier properties after a retort treatment and after a Gelboflex test.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above findings. An object of the present invention is to provide a barrier film whose gas barrier properties hardly deteriorate even after a retort treatment and after a Gelboflex test. Another object thereof is to provide a packaging material using such a barrier film.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is a barrier film comprising a barrier coat layer, an inorganic oxide deposition layer, and a substrate layer, in this order,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein the barrier coat layer has a hardness of 1.10 GPa or more and 1.55 GPa or less, and a plastic deformation rate of 21.0% or more.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the inorganic oxide deposition layer is preferably an aluminum deposition layer or a silicon oxide deposition layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the barrier coat layer is preferably a cured resin layer of a metal alkoxide and a water-soluble polymer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the barrier film has an oxygen transmission rate of preferably 1.0 cc/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, the oxygen transmission rate being measured in accordance with the JIS K7126 method under an environment with a temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and a humidity of 90% RH.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is a packaging material comprising the aforementioned barrier film.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the packaging material preferably comprises a heat sealing layer, a barrier layer made of the barrier film, and an outer layer, in this order.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the heat sealing layer preferably contains a polyolefin resin.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the outer layer preferably contains a polyester resin.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention can provide a barrier film whose gas barrier properties hardly deteriorate even after a retort treatment and after a Gelboflex test.

A packaging material using the barrier film of the present invention having such a layer structure can have gas barrier properties which hardly deteriorate even after a retort treatment. Since the packaging material has an improved bending resistance, the gas barrier properties hardly deteriorate even after a Gelboflex test. Such a barrier film can be suitably used as a barrier layer for a packaging material required to have gas barrier properties even after a retort treatment and after a Gelboflex test.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An oxygen transmission rate of the barrier film is preferably 1.0 cc/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, more preferably 0.8 cc/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, further preferably 0.6 cc/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, and furthermore preferably 0.5 cc/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm<b>19</b> day or less. The oxygen transmission rate is measured in accordance with the JIS K7126 method under an environment with a temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and a humidity of 90% RH. A barrier film whose oxygen transmission rate satisfies the above numerical range can have suitable oxygen barrier properties. Thus, the barrier film used as a barrier layer of a packaging material can suppress an adverse effect on contents of the packaging material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A water vapor transmission rate of the barrier film is preferably 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;day or less, more preferably 0.9 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;day or less, further preferably 0.8 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;day or less, and furthermore preferably 0.7 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;day or less. The water vapor transmission rate is measured in accordance with the JIS K7129 method under an environment with a temperature of 40&#xb0; C. and a humidity of 100% RH. A barrier film whose water vapor transmission rate satisfies the above numerical range can have suitable water vapor barrier properties. Thus, the barrier film used as a barrier layer of a packaging material can suppress an adverse effect on contents of the packaging material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A layer structure of one embodiment of the barrier film of the present invention is described with reference to the drawings.

A Berkovich indenter (triangular pyramid) was used as an indenter of the nanoindenter. The measurement was performed under an environment with 50% relative humidity and 23&#xb0; C.
