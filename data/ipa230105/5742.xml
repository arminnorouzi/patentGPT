Unfortunately, it is difficult to manufacture high quality nanowires. Conventional processes for manufacturing nanowires include selective-area-growth (SAG) wherein nanowires are selectively grown on a substrate. To function properly, nanowires must be a conducting semiconductor material, and the substrate on which the nanowires are grown often is an insulating material. As such, the nanowires grown on the same substrate are enabled for isolation from each other. However, there is often a large difference in the crystal lattice constant of the substrate and the nanowires to be grown via SAG. This crystal lattice mismatch causes crystalline defects in the nanowires during growth such as dislocations and stacking faults. The crystalline defects can penetrate the nanowires and in turn decrease the performance of the resulting nanowires.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a nanowire structure with reduced crystalline defects and methods of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure relates to a nanowire structure and a process for making the same.

If the substrate body <b>22</b> is formed of an insulating material, a high lattice constant mismatch may occur between the nanowire <b>18</b>/<b>20</b> and the substrate body <b>22</b>.

In a non-limiting example, the ion implantation process may be implemented by implanting oxygen ions into the substrate body <b>22</b>. The oxygen implantation into the conducting substrate body <b>22</b> will create electron traps, which suppress local conductivity. Because of the implantation mask <b>34</b>, the ion implantation process is only applied to the substrate body <b>22</b> through the first implantation opening <b>36</b> and the second implantation opening <b>38</b>.

Each of the first ion implantation region <b>14</b> and the second ion implantation region <b>16</b> may have a closed-loop shape in the X-Y plane (not shown).
