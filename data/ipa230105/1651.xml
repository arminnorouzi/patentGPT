Such a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin typically has such characteristics that molding in a short period of time is possible, secondary processing is possible, or recycle can easily be performed. Owing to these characteristics, the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin has come into attention to be used as automobile and electronic apparatus members which are relatively low in cost, large in the number of production, and demanded to have complicated shapes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">[PTL 1]</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Japanese Patent No. 6176691</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">[PTL 2]</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2012-109452</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">[PTL 3]</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2010-89394</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">[PTL 4]</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2010-150390</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">[PTL 5]</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0008">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2019-119213</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">[PTL 6]</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0009">Japanese Patent No. 5634641</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0010">Meanwhile, the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin described in PTL 1 is one having both strength and moldability, but a problem is yet to be solved in terms of elastic modulus which is another important parameter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">The carbon-fiber-reinforced resin using cut fibers as described in PTL 1 itself has certain degrees of strength and moldability, but when the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin is used alone, it has been difficult to largely enhance the elastic modulus while maintaining isotropic properties. On the other hand, the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin which does not have isotropic properties such as a continuous fiber has a problem in terms of moldability in that complicated molding is impossible in the first place.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">In recent years, amidst the development of composite materials according to various uses, composite materials in which metal and a fiber-reinforced resin are bonded are under development. For example, PTL 2 to PTL 6 disclose technologies in which a metallic material such as steel plate or aluminum and a fiber-reinforced resin are layered through or not through an adhesive. In any of the technologies, it is intended to provide a composite material in which metal and a fiber-reinforced resin are joined for the purpose of enhancing specific rigidity and specific strength or lightening and enhancing strength.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">It is an object of the present invention to provide a layered composite having high levels of both flexural modulus and moldability, in a composite material in which metal and a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin are layered. Particularly, it is an object to provide, in a layered composite including a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin having isotropic properties in which carbon fibers are impregnated with a thermoplastic resin and a metallic material (steel plate) layered on at least one surface of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin, a layered composite having a high flexural modulus and a molded body having a high flexural modulus by use of the layered composite.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Solution to Problems</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0014">A layered composite of the present embodiment is (1) a layered composite including a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin in which a chopped strand prepreg obtained by impregnating carbon fiber in resin is oriented and layered in such a manner as to exhibit pseudo-isotropic properties, and a steel plate that is layered on at least one surface of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin and has a tensile breakage elongation &#x3d5;

Note that a layered composite <b>10</b> of the present embodiment is used for an automobile member, an electronic apparatus member, or the like. The layered composite <b>10</b> of the present embodiment may be used in a flat plate state, or may be subjected to such molding as press molding under heating and/or pressure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the layered composite <b>10</b> of the present embodiment includes a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin <b>110</b> and a steel plate <b>120</b> layered on at least one surface of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin <b>110</b>. Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the steel plate <b>120</b> is layered on one side of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin <b>110</b> to constitute a two-layer structure, but the present invention is not limited to this.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">In other words, the steel plates <b>120</b> may be layered on both sides of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin <b>110</b> to constitute a three-layer structure. In addition, the carbon-fiber-reinforced resins <b>110</b> and the steel plates <b>120</b> may alternately be layered to constitute a multilayer structure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">The layered composite <b>10</b> of the present embodiment is characterized by a flexural modulus of equal to or more than 30 GPa in a flat plate state. The reason is as follows.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">In general, at the time of manufacturing a molded body by use of a carbon-fiber-reinforced resin, secondary processing is possible as an advantage of a thermoplastic resin, so that press molding using a press mold has often been conducted for a flat plate shaped carbon-fiber-reinforced resin. However, the present inventors, in manufacturing a molded body by the abovementioned method, found out that the molded body is lowered in the flexural modulus as compared to a flat plate, as a disadvantage of secondary processing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0032">On the other hand, for example, an electronic apparatus housing for protecting a precision part, enhancement of both thinning and rigidity is demanded. In the case where the housing is formed from only resin, it is necessary to increase the material thickness to enhance rigidity, but layering metal makes it possible to enhance rigidity of the layered body as a whole without increasing the material thickness of the resin part. For example, since an upper limit of the housing thickness is often determined for the housing of a personal computer (PC) or the like, it is an advantage that rigidity as a whole can be enhanced without increasing the material thickness of the resin. Yet, one method of enhancing the rigidity is to enhance the flexural modulus of the material.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0033">Hence, the present inventors, in order to enhance the flexural modulus to some extent also in a molded body by secondary processing, repeatedly made studies for enhancing flexural modulus even in a state of being in a flat plate before molding.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0034">Note that, though the reason why the molded body is lowered in flexural modulus as compared to a flat plate is yet to be clarified, material flow of the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin at the time of secondary processing is assumed to affect the flexural modulus.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">Further, the present inventors found out that, when the carbon-fiber-reinforced reason and the steel plate are layered on each other to constitute a layered composite, in a flat plate state, the flexural modulus can be enhanced as compared to the case where the layered composite includes the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin alone. Further, the present inventors also found out that, in the case where the molded body is manufactured by secondary processing, lowering in flexural modulus cannot be avoided as compared to a flat plate, but the flexural modulus can be enhanced as compared to the case where the layered composite includes the carbon-fiber-reinforced resin alone, thereby arriving at the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">In other words, in the layered composite <b>10</b> in the present embodiment, by setting the flexural modulus to be equal to or more than 30 GPa in a flat plate state, even when an automobile member or the like is manufactured by secondary processing, the flexural modulus of the molded body can be made to be equal to or more than a predetermined value.
