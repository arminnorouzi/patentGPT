A major drawback of proteins and peptide based therapeutics is the routine need to administer these compounds via injection and the routine need for refrigeration. Peptides such as teriparatide (Forteo&#xae;) and salmon calcitonin (Miacalcin&#xae; &#x26; Fortical&#xae;) need to be refrigerated as do insulin, amylin, and GLP-related peptides.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Salmon calcitonin, for example, is a peptide hormone which decreases bone breakdown by osteoclasts and the subsequent release of calcium from bone. When used to treat bone-related diseases and calcium disorders (such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and the like), it has the effect of helping maintain bone integrity and density by preventing bone breakdown. Many types of calcitonin have been isolated (e.g., human calcitonin, salmon calcitonin, eel calcitonin, porcine calcitonin, and chicken calcitonin). Notwithstanding a difference in molecular structure, salmon calcitonin may be used in humans for treatment of the calcitonin-responsive diseases discussed above. Salmon calcitonin is approximately 30-50 times more potent than human calcitonin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Peptide pharmaceuticals are typically administered by injection or by nasal administration. Oral administration tends to be problematic because of the proteolytic degradation of the peptide by resident enzymes in the stomach and intestine. The large molecular size of peptides also prevents or significantly lowers their bioavailability. Lastly, most peptides are zwitterionic; this polar nature further reduces bioavailability. Salmon calcitonin, as an example, lacks sufficient stability in the gastrointestinal tract where it is rapidly degraded by resident digestive enzymes into inactive fragments. In addition, due to its size and polar nature, it tends to be poorly transported through intestinal walls into the blood following oral administration. For this reason, commercially available calcitonin is formulated for injection or nasal administration. Injection and nasal administration, however, are significantly less convenient than, and involve more patient discomfort than, oral administration.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,918 discloses a multi-component system for oral delivery of peptides which included, inter alia, significant quantities of acid useful in lowering intestinal pH and hence the activity of intestinal proteases that have neutral or basic pH optima. Preferably, the components of the system are released into the intestines as close to simultaneously as possible. Uniform dispersion of the many components of the composition can aid this objective. However, interaction of the acid excipient with the peptide active agent is preferably avoided due to acid catalyzed degradation of the peptide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0017203 discloses a bi-layer tablet with a water-soluble coating that substantially prevents contact between a pH-lowering agent in a pharmaceutical formulation and an outer enteric coating. While such a formulation reduced the interaction of the peptide with pharmaceutical acid, consistent, reproducible, and near-simultaneous release of all components was more difficult. U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,377,863; 8,513,183; 8,592,366; 8,664,178 describe the use of malto-dextrin coated acid particles which allow the co-mingling of the peptide with the pH lowering agent in a manner which provides for the coordinated release of the peptide and pH lowering agent while at the same time preventing acid catalyzed degradation of the peptide. These patents also disclose the improvement in reproducible dissolution and bioavailability conferred by use of a water soluble sub-coat and a pH acid resistant enteric coat. Nevertheless, these tablets, although representing a significant improvement over bi-layer tablets, still required refrigeration in order to provide adequate commercially viable stability. At room temperature, these tablets would lose potency and may fail to meet regulatory requirements (90-110% label claim) for a solid dosage form. Accordingly, there remains a need for a room-temperature stable oral dosage form of salmon calcitonin.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides oral dosage forms, such as tablet formulations, as well as methods for making such tablet formulations. The present disclosure is based, in part, on developments that led to production of oral dosage forms, such as tablets, with minimal water content, and improved processes for attaining this minimal water content. This was particularly difficult for the formulation provided herein where the amount of active agent present (here, calcitonin) is relatively small versus the amount of excipients and the other non-active constituent components of the tablet. The present disclosure provides numerous benefits including, in certain embodiments, room temperature stability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure describes changes made to, e.g., the tablet core and the application of the sub-coat and enteric coat which affords room temperature stability to the present tablet formulation.

For example, a pharmaceutical formulation that retains 80% of its biological activity for at least 24 months from the time of packaging at room temperature would be considered room-temperature stable. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical formulation that retains 9-110% of its biological activity for at least 6 months from the time of packaging at room temperature would be considered room-temperature stable.

For example, a therapeutically effective amount of calcitonin may be an amount that is effective in treating or preventing a bone-related disorder, a calcium disorder, bone pain, an inflammatory disease or a degenerative disease in a subject. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of calcitonin may reduce bone loss; subchondral bone loss; alkaline phosphatase levels (e.g., in subjects suffering from Paget's disease); pain, including pain associated with Paget's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, or a recent fragility fracture and pain in an arthritic joint; and cartilage loss. Optionally, a therapeutically effective amount of calcitonin may stimulate cartilage synthesis or improve mobility in a subject suffering from arthritis. It is understood that any single dose of a therapeutically effective amount contributes to any overall observable response. The particular &#x201c;therapeutically effective dosage or amount&#x201d; will depend upon the age, weight and medical condition of the host, as well as on the method of administration. Suitable doses are readily determined by persons skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0110">The present disclosure arises out of the unexpected observation that the relative water content in solid oral calcitonin dosage forms impacted the room-temperature stability. Tablets having greater water content were less stable at room temperature and required refrigeration. Tablets having less water content were more stable at room temperature, alleviating the need for refrigeration. Decreasing the water content increased the amount of recoverable intact biologically active salmon calcitonin. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the lower water content in addition to reducing the level of acid catalyzed peptide hydrolysis may preserve the potency and recoverable peptide content from the tablet. As discussed in more detail below, achieving sufficiently low water content to realize this benefit to stability was particularly difficult because standard techniques typically introduce water content into the solid dosage form.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0111">Peptide based therapeutics due to their potency require relatively little amounts of the molecule to be biologically active; for instance injectable doses of sCT range from 8-16 &#x3bc;g and nasal calcitonin products contain 33 &#x3bc;gs of sCT. When considering a solid dosage form whose core may contain up to 1000 mg of excipients the amount of mass contributed by the peptide is small. If, for example, the peptide content of a tablet is 200 &#x3bc;g and the mass of the tablet is 1000 mg there is 5000 times more mass associated with the tablet components than the active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0112">From a manufacturing perspective this ratio (excipients:active ingredient) creates a problem when trying to achieve &#x201c;content uniformity&#x201d; which means that each tablet contains the intended dose of peptide. To overcome this problem, a typical approach in the art is to dissolve the peptide in an aqueous buffer or water to perform steps such as &#x201c;wet granulation&#x201d; that assists in the uniform dispersion of the peptide with the tablet components. This approach was used for example in the generation of bi-layer calcitonin tablets (U.S. Publication No. 2003/0017203) to assure content uniformity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0113">Dry blend with compression is preferred because the wet granulation technique leads to acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the peptide by the acid component (which is present in large excess when compared with the peptide) when stored at room temperature. Under refrigerated conditions the rate of this acid catalyzed hydrolysis is reduced substantially and allows for acceptable shelf life stability. Having a tablet with room temperature stability provides a significant improvement in convenience for patients and physicians alike. The present disclosure describes changes to the tablet core and the application of the sub-coat and enteric coat that result in a room temperature stable tablet.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0114">To reduce tablet core moisture content, excipients with low moisture content were sourced. In addition, the manufacturing specification for the water content of the peptide(s) was reduced from &#x3c;10% to &#x3c;5%. To further reduce water content, a dry blend direct compression process was developed to manufacture the tablet cores with low water content. The process included a series of steps including low energy milling of the peptide with the excipients that allowed for dry blending of the manufacturing excipients with the peptide which achieved acceptable content uniformity.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0115">The development of a tablet core with the requisite properties to support room temperature stability is the first step of the manufacturing process. The use of a barrier coating and pH sensitive enteric coating to deliver the solid dosage form to the proximal region of the intestine for drug delivery has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,377,863, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The barrier coating and outer enteric coating ensure that the tablet does not open in the stomach where the peptide would be degraded by gastric enzymes. The combination of the barrier coating (e.g., 6% (w/w) of the tablet core) and enteric coating (e.g., 7% (w/w) of the barrier-coated tablet core (i.e., the tablet core and barrier coat)) provides a mechanism to achieve rapid coordinated release of the drug and the excipients in the proximal intestine. This coordinated release of an pH modifying agent and the peptide are crucial to achieve acceptable bioavailability. Despite the use of selected excipients and dry blending to generate a tablet core with minimal water content, water content in the tablet core was found to increase following addition of the barrier coating and enteric coating when using industry standard techniques.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Methods of Coating a Tablet Core</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0116">The standard pharmaceutical coating materials used for coating the core tablets are both aqueous soluble agents that are applied to the tablets in a spray drying coater. Standard spray coating techniques, however, were found to introduce water content to the tablet core. The present disclosure provides conditions that were developed to prevent the ingress of water into the tablet core and to limit accumulation of water within the tablet core and/or at the tablet core/barrier coat interface, which would otherwise undermine the manufacture of a tablet core with low water content. As a result, the present disclosure provides both new methods, as well as new pharmaceutical tablets. The development of spray rates temperatures and airflow velocity minimize the observed increases in tablet water content and thereby reduce the likelihood and extent of acid catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide bonds and loss of peptide potency by binding to carbohydrate moieties present in the excipients. Alternatively, a water soluble barrier coating may be prepared and applied using non-aqueous (organic) solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol or methylene chloride. The water soluble barrier coating may be applied using a mixture of water and a non-aqueous solvent, e.g., 70% isopropyl alcohol and 30% water.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0117">The sub-coating process may be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the coating solution is sprayed at a low rate, using elevated drying temperatures and dry coating conditions. The objective is to prevent moisture penetration into the tablet core. After a certain amount of weight gain has been achieved, the spray rate may be increased to accelerate coating weight gain in the second stage of application. The accelerated spray rate helps ensure tablet quality; applying the entire sub-coating (i.e., barrier coating) at the low rate of the first stage may result in edge erosion, which may impact the function of the enteric coating applied over the sub-coat. Further, use of a single, low spray rate application may sacrifice a pharmaceutically elegant coating, resulting in pitting or an orange peel appearance, which may impact subsequent tablet imprinting, which helps with tablet identification. Further, the prolonged elevated drying temperatures of first-stage coating may negatively impact the peptide drug substance due to heat-induced denaturation and inactivation. A two-stage process, however, has been shown herein to minimize the impact of water ingress on the tablet core or water trapped at the tablet core/barrier coat interface, while maintaining tablet quality, including surface integrity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0118">Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure provides a method for spray coating a tablet core for oral delivery of calcitonin.

In some embodiments, the absorption enhancer is a surface active agent, which acts as both a solubility enhancer and an uptake enhancer. A solubility enhancer improves the ability of the solid dosage form, tablet or capsule components to be solubilized in either the aqueous environment into which they are originally released, into the lipophilic environment of the mucous layer lining the intestinal walls, or both. Transport enhancers (i.e., uptake enhancers) are those which facilitate the ease by which peptide agents cross the intestinal wall. Any suitable absorption enhancer may be used. In some embodiments, the absorption enhancer is a surface active agent selected from the group consisting of (i) anionic surface active agents that are cholesterol derivatives (e.g., bile acids), (ii) cationic surface agents (e.g., acyl carnitines, phospholipids and the like), (iii) non-ionic surface active agents, and (iv) mixtures of anionic surface active agents (especially those having linear hydrocarbon regions) together with negative charge neutralizers. Negative charge neutralizers include but are not limited to acyl carnitines, cetyl pyridinium chloride, and the like. Optionally, the absorption enhancer is soluble at acid pH, e.g., in the 3.0 to 5.0 range.

Further analysis revealed that batches of tablets that exhibit lower stability at RT conditions over time (e.g., Batch 1) were determined to have higher water content. By comparison, tablets from room-temperature stable batches (e.g., Batch 4) had low water content (e.g., less than 2.5% (w/w) water, or even less than 2.2% (w/w) water). For example, Batch 1 tablets contained 2.80% (w/w) water, while Batch 4 tablets contained 1.95% (w/w) water. Accordingly, methods for controlling water content and consistently manufacturing batches of tablets with lower water content, and thus room temperature stability, were developed (see, Examples 2 and 3). The final tablet water content was influenced by both the water content of the tablet core following direct compression and the impact of the subsequent application of the water soluble sub-coat and outer enteric coat.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0253">Tablets prepared as described herein to limit water content exhibited better room temperature stability than tablets having higher water content.

In the presence of water, rsCT rapidly degraded with concomitant loss of recovery and purity in the presence of Citric Acid DC F20. In the presence of water, there was a rapid loss of rsCT activity and non-concomitant loss in purity in the presence of Prosolv HD90.

The experiment evaluated a two tiered weight gain approach to the sub-coat application process. The batch was blended, compressed and divided into approximately two 31 kg sub-lots A and B. The coating experiments were performed using an O'Hara 30 inch coating pan. Application of the sub-coat was slow at the start of the process by using a low spray rate established in Batch 5 experiment I until a specified tablet weight gain, either 0.25% or 0.5% for the sub-coat was achieved (Batch 6 experiment I and II, respectively), then the spray rate was increased for the rest of the process.

After the tablets were enteric coated, they were packaged into HDPE bottles with 1 gram of desiccant and placed on accelerated stability.

Investigation into this coating appearance failure identified a disparity between the qualified flow rates for the spray nozzle being used and the targeted spray rates for the sub-coat and enteric-coat processes. The targeted flow rates used up to this point were below the acceptable flow rates specified for the nozzle. With the slow flow rates for these processes being below the acceptable operational range for this nozzle diameter size, the performance of the spray guns was poor which had a direct impact on the tablet appearance, coating process, and water uptake of the tablet core during the coating process. See, Table 7, below. A reduced spray gun orifice was selected for sub-coat application in a 48-inch pan (Batch 9) and showed improved tablet appearance and water uptake of the tablet core.
