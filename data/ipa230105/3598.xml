Pumping equipment, for example, can cause pressure ripples in the measurement media that can adversely impact the measurement accuracy and/or lifespan of the pressure transducer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An oil-filled capsule surrounding the pressure sensing element can protect the sensor from debris and enable the transducer to be used with almost any pressure media. However, when there are rapid pressure pulsations on the order of 1000's of psi per millisecond, especially in liquid media, such pressure changes can cause unwanted effects such as cavitation and suction near the oil fill isolation diaphragm. Since the diaphragm is typically very thin, such phenomena can cause the isolation diaphragm to rip or rupture and fail.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An internal cavity and/or other mechanical properties of the pressure transducer can result in a structure with a resonant frequency. Subjecting the pressure transducer to pressure ripples having frequencies that match the transducer's structural resonances can damage or reduce the lifespan of the pressure transducer. In these cases, a filter assembly may be placed at the inlet end of the transducer to eliminate the higher frequency ripples and leave static and quasi-static pressures intact. As discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,975,552, 9,500,533, 9,709,450, and 9,752,948, each assigned to Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc. and incorporated herein by reference as presented in full, various filters have been designed for coupling with a pressure transducer to reduce resonances near the frequency of the pressure ripple.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 10,330,553, also assigned to Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc. and incorporated herein by reference as presented in full, discloses mechanical filtering, for example, that can attenuate certain pressure oscillation frequencies, and block particulates. Such filtering techniques work well for certain applications and pressure media, but they can also cause an increase in the size of the transducer size, increase the likelihood of clogging, and can change the transducer frequency response.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since pressure ripple frequencies can change from system to system, pressure transducers that are specifically designed for each unique system can be costly, impractical, and can lack the flexibility needed for a wide range of applications. Thus, there is a need for a pressure transducer assembly that can be utilized with multiple systems and applications to protect against rapid pressure pulsations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A pressure transducer having a flexible member for protection is disclosed herein. The pressure transducer includes a header, a sensing element mounted to the header, an isolation diaphragm mounted on a front side of the header and adjacent to the sensing element, an oil-fill cavity disposed between the sensing element and the isolation diaphragm, a flexible member disposed adjacent to the isolation diaphragm and configured to protect the isolation diaphragm, a retention member disposed adjacent to the flexible member, and a cavity in communication with the retention member and configured to transmit a pressure media to the isolation diaphragm via the flexible member. In certain implementations, the retention member can comprise a screen having one or more thru-holes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of assembling a pressure transducer for dynamic pressure protection is disclosed herein. The method includes mounting a sensing element to a recessed portion of a header, securing an isolation diaphragm to the header adjacent to the sensing element such that an oil-fill cavity is formed between the sensing element and the isolation diaphragm, installing a flexible member adjacent to the isolation diaphragm, wherein the flexible member is configured to protect the isolation diaphragm, securing a retention member to an edge portion of the header adjacent to the flexible member, wherein the retention member constrains at least an edge portion of the flexible member against the header, and securing the header to a sensor housing such that a cavity is formed adjacent to the retention member, wherein the cavity configured to transmit a pressure media from an inlet port of the sensor housing to the isolation diaphragm via the flexible member. In certain implementations, the retention member can comprise a screen having one or more thru-holes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with certain example implementations of the disclosed technology, the flexible member may be shaped in the form of a flexible disc, which in certain embodiments, may include thru-holes to transmit pressure media to the isolation diaphragm. The flexible member may be utilized to substantially reduce high-frequency pressure ripples and allow static and quasi-static pressures to pass through to the sensing element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain example implementations, the flexible member may be custom-tuned to achieve the desired dampening frequency. The various embodiments of the flexible disc may protect the pressure transducer assembly in many different systems, with various pressure media, over a wide range of pulsation frequencies, and/or over a wide range of applied pressure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an exemplary pressure transducer assembly <b>100</b> with a sensing element region <b>200</b> as will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a sensing element region <b>200</b> of a pressure transducer assembly having a flexible member <b>206</b> for protection, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a front-end view of an exemplary perforated flexible disc <b>302</b>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an exemplary perforated flexible disc <b>302</b>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>400</b>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology provide for a compact, oil-filled transducer that can withstand high slew rate pressure pulsations. In certain exemplary implementations a flexible member, such as a rubber disc, may be disposed adjacent to and/or in contact with an isolation diaphragm of an oil-filled cavity that is in communication with a sensing element of the transducer.

Accordingly, it is not intended that the disclosed technology is limited in its scope to the details of construction and arrangement of components outlined in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The disclosed technology is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, in describing the preferred embodiments, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements, exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology are herein described. It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the disclosed technology have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the disclosed technology, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, many other elements found in typical pressure transducer assemblies and methods of making and using the same. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are desirable and/or required to implement the disclosed technology. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the disclosed technology, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an exemplary pressure transducer assembly <b>100</b> with a sensing element region <b>200</b> as will be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In general, the pressure transducer assembly <b>100</b> can include body <b>102</b> configured for sealed attachment to a pressure port of an external device so that pressure media may enter an inlet port <b>104</b> of the pressure transducer and be sensed by a pressure sensor in the sensing element region <b>200</b>. In certain implementations, the pressure transducer assembly <b>100</b> may include a cavity <b>106</b> in communication with the inlet port <b>104</b>. In accordance with certain exemplary implementations of the disclosed technology, the dimensions of the inlet port <b>104</b> and/or the dimensions of the cavity <b>106</b> may be designed to control pressure oscillation resonances and/or dampen certain pressure transients communicated to the pressure sensor via the pressure media, as discussed in U.S. Pat.

A header <b>202</b> may be utilized to house and/or support a sensing element <b>210</b>. In certain exemplary embodiments, an oil fill tube <b>204</b> may be utilized to add oil to a small cavity between the sensing element <b>210</b> and an isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> that may be welded to the header <b>202</b>. Once the oil is added, the oil fill tube <b>204</b> may be sealed to create a sealed oil-filled cavity. In this respect, the pressure exerted on the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> by the pressure media may be transferred through the oil cavity to the sensing element <b>210</b> so that the sensing element <b>210</b> is isolated from the pressure media. In certain implementations, electrical leads <b>214</b> may be utilized to connect the sensing element <b>210</b> with a connector on the backside of the transducer for measurement by external equipment. In some implementations, header pins may be utilized between the sensing element <b>210</b> and the electrical lead(s) <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with certain exemplary implementations of the disclosed technology, a flexible member <b>206</b> (such as a rubber disc as will be discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) may be placed against the outer edge of the header <b>202</b> and against the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>. A retention member <b>212</b> may then be installed so that the flexible member <b>206</b> is sandwiched between the edge of the header and the retention member <b>212</b>. In one exemplary implementation of the disclosed technology, the retention member <b>212</b> may be welded to the header. In other exemplary implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may be attached to secure the flexible member <b>206</b> using screws and/or a retaining ring and to allow for the replacement of the flexible member <b>206</b>. In certain implementations, the flexible member <b>206</b> may be supported only at the edges where the retention member <b>212</b> compresses the flexible member <b>206</b> against the header <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain exemplary implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may be embodied as a screen having a plurality of screen thru-holes that allow pressure media to pass therethrough while securing the edges of the flexible member <b>206</b> against the header <b>202</b>. In some implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may include a single aperture to allow the pressure media to pass therethrough.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with certain exemplary implementations of the disclosed technology, the retention member <b>212</b> and/or the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured to allow room to expand outward if the media pressure media causes it to swell. In practice, when the pressure media (having a net positive pressure) is introduced to the flexible member <b>206</b> via one or more apertures in the retention member <b>212</b>, it may put pressure on the flexible member <b>206</b> and cause it to compress slightly due to the pressure, but the flexible member <b>206</b> may generally stay in contact with the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> to transmit applied pressure because the flexible member <b>206</b> may be forced against the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> by the positive pressure. In certain implementations, the edges of the retention member <b>212</b> may be configured to squeeze the flexible member <b>206</b> enough against the header <b>202</b> to create a seal so that the pressure media does not get between the flexible member <b>206</b> and the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>. If the pressure in the pressure media drops suddenly, the flexible member <b>206</b> may expand and may pull away from the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>. Since the flexible member <b>206</b> is only placed against the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> (without adhesive) and is held in place by the edges of the retention member <b>212</b>, the flexible member <b>206</b> can pull away from the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> and leave the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> intact. In this respect, the flexible member <b>206</b> can act as a shock absorber for protecting the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may have multiple retention member thru-apertures <b>216</b> (i.e., perforations) defined in at least a central area of the retention member <b>212</b> so that pressure from the pressure media may be transmitted evenly across the flexible member <b>206</b>. In certain implementations, the diameters of the retention member thru-apertures <b>216</b> may be configured to avoid clogging by particulates in the pressure media.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with certain exemplary implementations, the flexible member <b>206</b> may comprise a rubber. In certain implementations, the flexible member <b>206</b> may comprise one or more of EPDM rubber, silicon, Neoprene, Viton, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, elastomer, nitrile, butyl, Timprene, foam, sponge rubber, flexible PVC, thermoplastic elastomer, ManniGlas, FiberFrax, and/or other flexible material. In certain implementations, the flexible member <b>206</b> may be embodied as a disc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Different types of thickness for the flexible member <b>206</b> may be chosen depending on the intended media and pressure range. The thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may generally range from about 0.5 millimeters to about 5 millimeters. Other thicknesses of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be utilized without departing from the scope of the disclosed technology. In some implementations, for example, the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 300 microns to about 500 microns. In some implementations, the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 500 microns to about 1 millimeter. In certain implementations, the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 1 millimeter to about 2 millimeters. In some implementations the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 2 millimeters to about 3 millimeters. In some implementations the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 3 millimeters to about 4 millimeters. In some implementations the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 4 millimeters to about 5 millimeters. In some implementations the thickness of the flexible member <b>206</b> may be configured in the range of about 5 millimeters to about 7 millimeters.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with certain exemplary implementations of the disclosed technology, the flexible member <b>206</b> may cause high-frequency signals to be dampened or distorted. However, in certain applications where the transducer is used to measure static or quasi-static pressure, such high-frequency distortions may be electronically filtered out.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a front-end view of an exemplary flexible member <b>206</b> embodied as a perforated flexible disc <b>302</b>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an exemplary flexible member <b>206</b> embodied as a perforated flexible disc <b>302</b>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosed technology. The perforated flexible disc <b>302</b> may be installed between the retention member <b>212</b> and the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> in the transducer assembly <b>100</b> (similar to the flexible member <b>206</b>) as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, in this implementation, the perforated flexible disc <b>302</b> may be more tightly constrained and may have flexible member thru-apertures <b>304</b> that correspond to the retention member thru-apertures <b>216</b>. In certain exemplary implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may include a single, large central aperture that allows pressure media to exert force on most of the flexible member <b>206</b>. In some implementations, the central aperture of the retention member <b>212</b> may be large enough that the pressure media may impinge directly on each of the flexible member thru-apertures <b>304</b> (and the flexible member <b>206</b> material between the apertures <b>304</b>). Yet in other example implementations, the retention member <b>212</b> may be configured as a screen having a plurality of thru-apertures <b>216</b>. In the screen embodiment, the retention member <b>212</b> may provide some added protection for the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> and/or support for the flexible disc <b>302</b> against the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain implementations, it may not be an intended function of the perforated flexible disc <b>302</b> to transmit the applied pressure to the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b> directly, but rather, via the pressure media which may pass through both the retention member thru-apertures <b>216</b> and the flexible member thru-apertures <b>304</b>. In this implementation, the perforated flexible disc <b>302</b> may help prevent the isolation diaphragm from deflecting towards the retention member <b>212</b> when there is a large negative pressure applied in the pressure media. This embodiment may be particularly useful in applications such as reciprocating compressors, where very large and repeated pressure drops can occur. Such applications can tend to rip isolation diaphragms as the pressure of the media falls much more quickly than the pressure inside the oil fill cavity, so there can be a large negative force exerted on the isolation diaphragm <b>208</b>.
