It applies quite particularly to Lithium-Metal-Polymer or LMP&#x2122; batteries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">LMP&#x2122; batteries are generally in the form of an assembly of superposed thin films (rolling or stacking with the following pattern (electrolyte/cathode/collector/cathode/electrolyte/anode) on n turns) or of n stacked thin films (cut and superposed, i.e. n stacks with the aforementioned pattern). This stacked/complexed unit pattern has a thickness of the order of about a hundred micrometres. It is made up of four functional layers: i) a negative electrode (anode) providing the supply of lithium ions during discharge of the battery, ii) a solid polymer electrolyte that conducts lithium ions, iii) a positive electrode (cathode) composed of an active electrode material acting as a receptacle where the lithium ions are inserted, and finally iv) a current collector in contact with the positive electrode and making it possible to provide the electrical connection.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The negative electrode of the LMP&#x2122; batteries is generally constituted by a sheet of pure metallic lithium or of a lithium alloy; the solid polymer electrolyte is generally composed of a polymer based on polyethylene oxide (PEO) and at least one lithium salt; the positive electrode is usually a material the working potential of which is below 4V vs Li+/Li (i.e. the insertion/deinsertion potential of lithium is below 4V) such as for example a metal oxide (for example such as V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, LiV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>and LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>etc.) or a phosphate of the type LiMPO<sub>4</sub>, where M represents a metal cation selected from the group Fe, Mn, Co, Ni and Ti, or combinations of these cations, for example such as LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, and also contains carbon and a polymer; and the current collector is generally constituted by a sheet of metal. Ion conductivity is provided by dissolution of the lithium salt in the polymer included in the composition of the solid electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sodium-ion (Na-ion) technology seems to be a promising alternative for a new generation of batteries, in particular in the field of stationary energy storage on account of the high natural abundance and low cost of sodium with respect to lithium.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sodium batteries generally have a cathode in which the active material is a compound capable of inserting sodium ions reversibly, an electrolyte comprising a sodium salt that dissociates easily, and an anode whose active material may in particular be a sheet of pure metallic sodium or of a sodium-based alloy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in both these types of batteries, the negative electrodes have in common that they are in the form of a very thin film, generally with a thickness less than approximately 100 &#x3bc;m. It is difficult to manufacture industrially and manipulate films of metallic lithium or of metallic sodium with a much smaller thickness, in particular on account of the very malleable and adherent character of these metals.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various solutions for overcoming this technical problem have already been proposed in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By way of example, international application WO 2013/121164 describes a negative electrode based on lithium or sodium in the form of a thin film, comprising (i) a reinforcement layer formed by a porous substrate, and (ii) a first and a second metal film based on lithium or sodium, the reinforcement layer being sandwiched between the two metal films based on lithium or sodium and bonded together by pressure to form a composite structure having a total thickness less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m in which the pores of the porous substrate are at least partly filled by the metal of the first and second metal films. According to this international application the porous substrate is a material that is not electrically conducting, and is in the form of a fibrous material, for example in the form of polymer fibres that are not electrically conducting. This negative electrode is therefore in the form of a composite structure with at least 3 layers, in which the two metal films constitute the upper and lower external faces of the electrode, with the porous substrate trapped between them. However, the technology proposed in this international application is not entirely satisfactory, as the cohesion between the metal films and the fibrous support is not always good. Moreover, the metal films present on each of the faces of the porous substrate may tear and/or become disconnected electrically from the rest of the electrode thus constituted, which has the effect of altering the performance of the electrode and battery comprising such an electrode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is therefore a need for a negative electrode that can be manipulated easily and comprises a thin film based on pure metallic lithium, pure metallic sodium or an alloy thereof, and does not have such drawbacks. There is also a need for a method for manufacturing such an electrode, the latter being thinner than the existing electrodes, and easily on an industrial scale.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These aims are achieved in particular with the negative electrode and the method of preparation thereof, which form the subject matter of the present invention and which will be described hereunder.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention therefore relates firstly to a negative electrode that is in the form of a composite material comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">(i) at least one metallic layer based on pure lithium, pure sodium or an alloy of lithium or of sodium,<br/>(ii) at least one polymer membrane comprising at least one polymer, said polymer membrane having two faces,<br/>said electrode being characterized in that:<br/>said polymer membrane is non-porous and is in direct physical contact, by at least one of its two faces, with said metallic layer,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">said at least one polymer is selected from:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">(a) electrically non-conducting polymers selected from the group comprising polyolefins; homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene oxide (e.g. PEO, PEO copolymer), of methylene oxide, of propylene oxide, of epichlorohydrin or of allylglycidyl ether, and mixtures thereof; halogenated polymers; homopolymers and copolymers of styrene and mixtures thereof; vinyl polymers; anionic polymers; polyacrylates; and one of the mixtures thereof; and<br/>(b) electrically conducting polymers selected from the group comprising polyaniline, polypyrroles, polyfluorenes, polypyrenes, polyazulenes, polynaphthalenes, polycarbazoles, polyindoles, polyazepines, polythiophenes, poly(p-phenylene sulfides), polyacetylenes and poly(p-phenylene vinylenes).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">Owing to the presence of this polymer membrane, very thin metal films (thickness generally less than or equal to approximately 45 &#x3bc;m) can be manipulated easily. This polymer membrane is chemically compatible with the metal of the metallic layer with which it is in contact by at least one of its faces. It is flexible and follows the shape of the grains of lithium or sodium. It is in particular capable of flowing between the grains of lithium or sodium to maintain the mechanical integrity of the metallic layer, even if there are tears in the latter. Finally, the polymer membrane of the negative electrode according to the invention has the particular feature of being able to stretch, at the same time as the metallic layer with which it is in contact during lamination of the electrode, each of the layers then becoming thinner in the same proportion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Within the meaning of the present invention, when it is stated that the polymer membrane is non-porous, this means that it has a porosity less than or equal to 10% by volume, preferably less than or equal to 5% by volume with respect to the total volume of said membrane.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">Also within the meaning of the present invention, when it is stated that the polymer membrane is in direct physical contact, by at least one of its faces, with said metallic layer, this means that no other layer will be interposed between said face of the polymer membrane and the metallic layer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">Still within the meaning of the present invention, when it is stated that the polymer membrane is chemically compatible with the metal of the metallic layer with which it is in contact, this means that the polymer is not altered on being brought into contact with the metal. In fact, although the polymer may be reduced at the surface of the membrane, the core of the membrane does not react chemically.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">By way of polyolefins may be mentioned in particular the homopolymers or the copolymers of ethylene and of propylene, as well as mixtures of at least two of these polymers. By way of halogenated polymers may be mentioned in particular the homopolymers and the copolymers of vinyl chloride, of vinylidene fluoride (PVdF), of vinylidene chloride, of ethylene tetrafluoride, or of chlorotrifluoroethylene, the copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and of hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-co-HFP) and mixtures thereof. By way of anionic polymers may be mentioned in particular poly(styrene sulfonate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(glutamate), alginate, pectin, carrageenan and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">According to the invention, the electrically non-conducting polymers are preferably selected from the homopolymers and the copolymers of ethylene oxide (e.g. PEO, PEO copolymer), the copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-co-HFP) and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">The polymer membrane of the negative electrode according to the invention may additionally contain at least one electron conduction additive. In this case, such an additive may in particular be selected from carbon-containing fillers such as carbon black, graphite, carbon fibres and nanofibres, carbon nanotubes and graphene; particles of at least one conductive metal such as aluminium, copper, gold, silver, platinum, iron, cobalt and nickel; and one of the mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">When it is present, the electron conduction additive preferably represents from approximately 5 to 80% by weight, and even more preferably from approximately 10 to 30% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the polymer membrane of the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">According to the invention, the polymer membrane of the negative electrode is preferably an electrically conducting polymer membrane. In this case, the polymer membrane is electrically conducting, either because it comprises one or more electrically non-conducting polymers and at least one electron conduction additive, or because it comprises at least one electrically conducting polymer optionally in the presence of at least one electron conduction additive.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">In fact, when the polymer membrane of the negative electrode according to the present invention is electrically conducting, grain-to-grain electrical conduction can be maintained even in the case of mechanical rupture or tearing of the metallic layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">The polymer membrane of the negative electrode according to the invention may additionally contain at least one salt comprising at least one anion and at least one metal cation M.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">The salts may in particular be selected from MBF<sub>4</sub>, MPF<sub>6</sub>, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>M (triflate), a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide of a metal cation M (MTFSI), a bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide of a metal cation M (MFSI), a bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide of a metal cation M (MBETI), MAsF<sub>6</sub>, MCF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, MSbF<sub>6</sub>, MSbCl<sub>6</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>TiCl<sub>6</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>SeCl<sub>6</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>Cl<sub>10</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>B<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, MNO<sub>3</sub>, MClO<sub>4</sub>, a trifluoroimidazole of a metal cation M (MTDI), a tetrafluoroborate of a metal cation M (MFOB), a bis(oxalato)borate of a metal cation M (MBOB), M<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">The metal cation M may be selected from lithium, beryllium, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, potassium, calcium, silver, rubidium, strontium, caesium, barium, radium and francium cations. Among such cations, lithium and sodium are preferred.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">According to the present invention, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">When the polymer membrane comprises a salt comprising at least one anion and at least one metal cation M, the amount of said salt then preferably represents from 5 to 30% by weight, and even more preferably from 10 to 25% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the polymer membrane.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">The polymer membrane of the negative electrode according to the invention preferably has a thickness of approximately 2 to 50 &#x3bc;m, and even more preferably approximately 2 to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The metallic layer of the negative electrode generally has a thickness of approximately 1 to 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably approximately 5 to 30 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">According to a particular and preferred embodiment of the invention, the negative electrode further comprises at least one second metallic layer, said second metallic layer being in direct physical contact with the other face of said non-porous polymer membrane.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">According to this particular embodiment of the invention, the negative electrode is therefore composed of at least three layers, namely, in this order, a first metallic layer, a layer of non-porous polymer membrane, and at least one second metallic layer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">In this case, the first and the second metallic layers are thus separated from one another by said non-porous polymer membrane.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">According to this embodiment, the first metallic layer is preferably identical to the second metallic layer.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">Within the meaning of the present invention, the term &#x201c;identical&#x201d; means that the first and the second metallic layers are constituted by the same metal or by the same alloy and that they have approximately the same thickness.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">According to this particular embodiment, the total thickness of the electrode with at least three layers according to the present invention preferably varies from approximately 10 to 100 &#x3bc;m, and even more particularly from approximately 15 to 60 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">The negative electrode according to the invention may further comprise a current collector. In this case, said electrode comprises at least one electrically conducting non-porous polymer membrane and said current collector is in direct physical contact with said membrane.

This method is characterized in that it comprises at least one step of application of a non-porous polymer membrane based on at least one polymer on at least one metallic layer based on pure lithium, pure sodium or an alloy of lithium or of sodium, said polymer being selected from:</p><p id="p-0044" num="0000">(a) electrically non-conducting polymers selected from the group comprising polyolefins; homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene oxide (e.g. PEO, PEO copolymer), of methylene oxide, of propylene oxide, of epichlorohydrin or of allylglycidyl ether, and mixtures thereof; halogenated polymers; homopolymers and copolymers of styrene and mixtures thereof; vinyl polymers; anionic polymers; polyacrylates; and one of the mixtures thereof; and<br/>(b) electrically conducting polymers selected from the group comprising polyaniline, polypyrroles, polyfluorenes, polypyrenes, polyazulenes, polynaphthalenes, polycarbazoles, polyindoles, polyazepines, polythiophenes, poly(p-phenylene sulfides), polyacetylenes and poly(p-phenylene vinylenes).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0041">According to a first embodiment, the polymer membrane is manufactured by extrusion and then deposited on said metallic layer, for example by lamination.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0042">According to a first particular variant of this first embodiment, the negative electrode is composed of at least three layers, namely, in this order, a first metallic layer, a layer of non-porous polymer membrane comprising two faces, and at least one second metallic layer and it is obtained by the complexing of the first and second metallic layers respectively on each of the faces of said non-porous polymer membrane.
