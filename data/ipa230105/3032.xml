Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a system for fastening slats, and in particular to a system for fastening to a flat surface slats with a rectangular or square plan shape predisposed to be arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart, to create, totally or partially, a flooring or a wall or a ceiling.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In construction, in order to create floors, it is known to cover surfaces, such as for example a screed or a portion of land, with slats, made of wood or other materials, having a typically square or rectangular plan shape, which are arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart (usually by a few millimetres) above this surface, until generally covering it completely.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The slats can rest directly on the surface to be covered, or they can be placed on an intermediate structure (for example a frame and/or a plurality of small crosspieces of elongated shape arranged parallel and spaced mutually apart) fastened, for example by means of screws or rivets, possibly with the interposition of adjustable-height spacers on the surface to be covered, and interposed therebetween and the slats, so as to define in turn a flat support surface for the slats.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are various systems for fastening these slats to a support surface (be it the same surface to be covered or the surface of the intermediate structure mentioned above).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nowadays the most commonly used fastening systems include providing the slats, which on the side walls thereof, with the slats laid to form the flooring, will face the side walls of other similar slats, with longitudinal grooves, and to stably fasten to the surface to be covered (and/or to the intermediate structure, if present), in the interspaces between two contiguous slats, locking elements which fit into the longitudinal grooves of the slats, preventing them from lifting from the surface to be covered.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common known solution provides that after positioning a first slat on the surface to be covered, one or more locking elements are inserted in a longitudinal groove of the slat, and are fastened to the underlying surface to be covered by means of a screw; the assembly procedure then provides that a second slat is positioned parallel and spaced from the first, taking care to position a longitudinal groove of the second slat to accommodate the locking element already constrained to the first slat and to the surface to be covered. After positioning the second slat, one or more second locking elements can be inserted in the second longitudinal groove and stably fastened to the underlying surface to be covered by means of suitable screws.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The procedure for creating the flooring then proceeds in this manner, gradually positioning a new slat and one or more new locking elements, until the flooring is created.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, this known solution has some drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">First of all, the presence of the longitudinal grooves in the slats weakens them at the edges thereof, with the risk that, if a body, for example the heel of a shoe, exerts a high pressure in this region of the slat, the latter will break.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, the procedure for laying the slats is rather awkward and laborious, requiring to place, in a precise order, first a slat, then one or more locking elements, then a further slat, then one or more further locking elements, and so on, until the flooring is completed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main task of the present disclosure is to obviate the aforementioned drawbacks, and in particular to provide a system for fastening slats to a flat surface which reduces the risk of breaking such slats even in the event of high pressures exerted thereon.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Within this task, the present disclosure provides a system for fastening slats which maintains a low weight, so as to facilitate the transport and laying thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure also provides a system for fastening slats which maintains a low cost.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure further provides a system for fastening slats which allows to reduce the laying times with respect to the known art.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other advantages according to the present disclosure are achieved by providing a system for fastening to a flat surface slats with a rectangular or square plan shape, predisposed to be arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart to create, totally or partially, a flooring or wall or ceiling, such a system comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">a base, which can be integrally associated with a flat surface, this base being configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto at least two of these slats in a laying condition in which they are placed side by side and spaced mutually apart;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">means for fastening said base to two of these slats positioned above and/or laterally thereto in the laying condition;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0018">supporting means of at least one of two of these slats positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, adapted to prevent or limit the bending of this at least one slat towards the base,<br/>in which said supporting means comprise at least one bridge structure defined by two legs, projecting from the base and spaced mutually apart, connected above by a crosspiece which defines, on the opposite side to the base, a contact surface adapted to position between the base and a portion of one of two of these slats positioned above and/or laterally to this base in the laying condition, to prevent or limit the deformation of said portion towards the base.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">The bridge structure, interposing between the overlying slat and the base, reduces the risk that this slat bends, or bends beyond a certain limit, even if it is subjected to pressures of relatively high entities, such as for example that exerted by the heel of a shoe, thus reducing the risk of breakage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Furthermore, the bridge structure, thanks to the legs thereof, optimally discharges the stresses exerted by the overlying slat on the base, from which these forces are discharged onto the flat surface to which the base is associated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">Furthermore, the bridge structure has a high resistance to stress, while maintaining a low weight; the system thus obtained therefore maintains a low weight, and also a limited production cost, requiring less material, for example, compared to a structure in which the bridge element is replaced by a solid wall. Furthermore, the system according to the disclosure allows an easy laying, allowing to fasten, in a first step, all the bases to one or more flat surfaces, and in a second step fasten all the slats to these bases.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Advantageously, the supporting means comprise two bridge structures, spaced mutually apart, each configured to be arranged with the respective abutment surface between the base and a portion of respectively two slats positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, to prevent or limit the deformation of this portion towards the base.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Preferably, the two crosspieces of the two bridge structures are connected together by one or more transverse elements; these transverse elements increase the mechanical resistance of the structure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Advantageously, the abutment surface of the crosspieces is substantially flat, parallel and spaced from the base; in this way the support action on the overlying slat is more uniform and balanced.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Advantageously, the one or more transverse elements each define an abutment surface, parallel to and spaced from the base, and substantially coplanar to the abutment surface defined by the crosspieces.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment, the constraining means are formed in one piece with the supporting means; this configuration allows to reduce the complexity of the system, and to limit the number of components of the same, thus maintaining the low weight and cost thereof.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">In a further advantageous embodiment, the constraining means comprise a rotatable body positioned or positionable, when two slats are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, at least partially in the interspace between said slats, said rotatable body being rotatable with respect to the base between a retaining position, in which it is constrained to the base and to two slats when the same are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, and a release position in which, when two slats are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, the rotatable body is not constrained to the two slats, allowing it to be separated from the rotatable body and from the base, in which the rotatable body comprises constraining means of the mutual rotation between the rotatable body and one end of a tool which can be inserted with this end in the interspace between two of these slats positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition; this solution allows to easily remove one or more slats, and possibly reposition or replace them, without the need to remove all the slats placed laterally to the slat to be removed starting from the farthest away. In fact, the rotatable body can be rotated and brought into the release condition simply by inserting a tool in the interspace between the slats, thus allowing the slats to be released from the base.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">Advantageously, the system comprises end stop means adapted to limit the rotation of the rotatable body with respect to the base between the retaining position and the release position; these end stop means facilitate the operations to bring the rotatable body into the release and/or retaining position. Advantageously, the constraining means of the mutual rotation between the rotatable body and an end of a tool consist of or comprise a groove (this term also possibly meaning a hole) formed in the rotatable body, adapted for the insertion of the end of the tool and shaped in such a way that this end cannot rotate in the groove once inserted therein, so that a rotation of this end of this tool involves the integral rotation of the rotatable body. It should be noted that the tool is not part of the disclosure, and that a given groove can, for example, be shaped so that it can be used with different types of tools, such as for example a screwdriver, an Allen wrench, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">In an advantageous embodiment, the rotatable body is formed in one piece (i.e., in a single body, obtained for example by moulding a plastic material or a metal) with the base, and can be rotated with respect to the same after breaking or deformation of connecting means between the base and the rotatable body, formed in one piece therewith; this solution facilitates the production of the system according to the disclosure, reducing the production cost thereof. Furthermore, this solution reduces the risk that the rotatable body may be lost during the transport of the system. Finally, this solution facilitates the laying of the system, as it is sufficient to fasten the base to the flat surface to also constrain the rotatable body thereto.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment, the rotatable body is formed in one piece with the base in the release position, and can be rotated in the retaining position after breaking or deforming the connecting means.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031">In a different advantageous embodiment, the rotatable body is formed in one piece with the base in the retaining position, and can be rotated in the release position after breaking or deforming the connecting means.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">In a further advantageous embodiment, the system comprises retaining means of the rotatable body configured to prevent the separation of this rotatable body from the base when the rotatable body is rotated in the retaining position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">Preferably, these retaining means are formed in one piece and/or coincide at least partially with the supporting means; this configuration reduces the complexity and the number of components of the system according to the disclosure, thus keeping the weight and production costs thereof reduced.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment, the retaining means comprise the aforementioned bridge structure, the rotatable body being configured to be arranged, in the retaining position, at least partially between the crosspiece of this bridge structure and the base, so that the crosspiece limits the displacement of this rotatable body in the direction running from the base to the crosspiece.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">More preferably, the retaining means comprise two bridge structures, and the rotatable body is configured to be arranged, in the retaining position, at least partially between the crosspieces of these bridge structures and the base, so that these crosspieces limit the movement of the rotatable body in the directions running from the base to the crosspieces.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment, the base comprises coupling means to a base of a further analogous system arranged aligned therewith; in this way it is possible to create structures comprising a plurality of systems aligned together, provided with a plurality of constraining means of the bases thereof to the slats, which can be laid very easily and can allow the fastening of three or more slats.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">In a preferred embodiment, the base is configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto three or more slats in a laying condition in which they are arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart, this system comprising, for each pair of slats placed side by side and spaced mutually apart, separate constraining means of the base to the pair of slats which can be positioned at least partially in the interspace between each pair of said slats.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">In an advantageous embodiment, the base is configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto, in the laying condition, at least two rectangular or square plan shape slats provided, on at least one of the side walls thereof, with a longitudinal groove, and predisposed to be arranged in the laying condition, two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart, with the respective longitudinal grooves mutually faced, in which the at least one bridge structure is configured to be positioned with the abutment surface of the crosspiece, when two slats are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, at least partially inside a longitudinal groove of one of these slats.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">Preferably, the system comprises two bridge structures configured to be positioned with the respective bearing surfaces of the crosspieces, when two slats provided with longitudinal grooves are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, respectively at least partially inside the longitudinal grooves of the two slats.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, the constraining means comprise two lateral appendages shaped and positioned in such a way that they can be respectively inserted in the mutually faced longitudinal grooves of two slats when the latter are positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, to constrain these slats to the base.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">Advantageously, the lateral appendages have an inclined shape and diverge from each other in the direction approaching the base, to facilitate the snap entry thereof in the longitudinal grooves of the slats.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0042">In an advantageous embodiment, the system comprises bearing means for the rotatable body configured to prevent or limit the displacement of this rotatable body towards the base.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">Preferably, these bearing means are formed in one piece with the supporting means; this configuration allows to keep the number of components and the constructive complexity of the system limited, thus maintaining a reduced weight and cost. Preferably, the lateral appendages project from opposite parts of the rotatable body and are aligned with each other.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, the system comprises thrust means adapted to exert, during the removal of two slats previously positioned above and/or laterally to the base in the laying condition, and during a rotation of the rotatable body from the retaining position to the release position, a thrust on the slats in the direction away from the base. This solution facilitates the release of the slats from the base.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0045">Preferably, these thrust means comprise one or more cam, or inclined plane or helical surfaces, projecting radially from the rotatable body and configured to interact with an edge of the slats facing, with the slats in the laying condition, towards the base, for pushing, during the rotation of the rotatable body from the retaining position to the release position, this edge from the opposite part to the base.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0046">Advantageously, the base and the constraining means are made of plastic or metal or a combination of the two.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0047">Advantageously, the base can be fastened to the flat surface by means of screws and/or rivets and/or gluing.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0048">In advantageous embodiments, the system comprises further means for retaining the rotatable body configured to prevent the separation thereof from the base even when the rotatable body is in the release position; this solution facilitates the transport of the system according to the disclosure, since there is no risk of losing the rotatable body, and also facilitates the laying thereof, since the rotatable body remains constrained to the base during the laying.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0049">The present patent application also relates to a further disclosure, which can be used autonomously and independently of the previously illustrated disclosure, and which solves the distinct technical problem of facilitating the release and re-coupling of the slats to a base which can be fastened to a flat surface, and at the same time to keep costs and/or production and laying times reduced; in particular, this solution relates to a system for fastening to a flat surface slats with a rectangular or square plan shape predisposed to be arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart to create, totally or partially, a floor or wall or ceiling, said system comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0050">a base, which can be integrally associated with a flat surface, said base being configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto at least two of said slats in a laying condition in which they are placed side by side and spaced mutually apart;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0051">means for fastening said base to two of said slats positioned above and/or laterally thereto in said laying condition, said constraining means comprising a rotatable body positioned or positionable, when two of said slats are positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition, at least partially in the interspace between said slats, said rotatable body being rotatable with respect to said base between a retaining position, in which it is constrained to said base and to two of said slats when the same are positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition, and a release position in which, when two of said slats are positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition, said rotatable body is not constrained to said two slats, allowing the separation thereof from said rotatable body and from said base, which is characterized in that said rotatable body is formed in one piece with said base, and can be rotated with respect to said base after breaking or deformation of connecting means between said base and said rotatable body, formed in one piece therewith.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">This innovative solution facilitates the production of the system according to the disclosure, reducing the production cost thereof. Furthermore, this solution reduces the risk that the rotatable body may be lost during the transport of the system. Finally, this solution facilitates the laying of the system, as it is sufficient to fasten the base to the flat surface to also constrain the rotatable body thereto.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">In a preferred embodiment, said rotatable body is formed in one piece with said base in the release position, and can be rotated in the retaining position after breaking or deformation of said connecting means.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">In a different advantageous embodiment, said rotatable body is formed in one piece with said base in said retaining position, and can be rotated in said release position after breaking or deformation of said connecting means.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">In an advantageous embodiment, said rotatable body comprises constraining means of the mutual rotation between said rotatable body and an end of a tool which can be inserted with said end in the interspace between two of said slats positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">This solution allows to easily remove one or more slats, and possibly reposition or replace them, without the need to remove all the slats placed laterally to the slat to be removed starting from the farthest away. In fact, the rotatable body can be rotated and brought into the release condition simply by inserting a tool in the interspace between the slats, thus allowing the slats to be released from the base.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">Advantageously, said constraining means of the mutual rotation between said rotatable body and one end of a tool consist of or comprise a groove formed in said rotatable body, adapted for the insertion of said end of said tool and shaped in such a way that said end cannot rotate in said groove once inserted therein, so that a rotation of said end of said tool involves the integral rotation of said rotatable body. It should be noted that the tool is not part of the disclosure, and that a given groove can, for example, be shaped so that it can be used with different types of tools, such as for example a screwdriver, an Allen wrench, etc. Advantageously, the system comprises end stop means adapted to delimit the rotation of said rotatable body with respect to said base between said retaining position and said release position. These end stop means facilitate the operations to bring the rotatable body into the release and/or retaining position.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">In a further advantageous embodiment, said system comprises retaining means of said rotatable body configured to prevent the separation of said rotatable body from said base when said rotatable body is rotated in said retaining position.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">In a preferred embodiment, said base comprises coupling means to a base of a further analogous system arranged aligned therewith; in this way it is possible to create structures comprising a plurality of systems aligned with each other, provided with a plurality of constraining means of the bases thereof to the slats, which can be laid very easily and can allow the fastening of three or more slats.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">In a preferred embodiment, said base is configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto three or more of said slats in a laying condition in which they are arranged two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart, said system comprising, for each pair of said slats placed side by side and spaced mutually apart, separate constraining means of said base to said pair of slats which can be positioned at least partially in the interspace between each pair of said slats.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">In an advantageous embodiment, said base is configured for positioning above and/or laterally thereto, in said laying condition, at least two rectangular or square plan shape slats provided, on at least one of the side walls thereof, with a longitudinal groove, and predisposed to be arranged in said laying condition, two by two side by side and spaced mutually apart, with the respective said longitudinal grooves mutually faced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">In a preferred embodiment, said constraining means comprise two lateral appendages shaped and positioned in such a way that they can be respectively inserted in said mutually faced longitudinal grooves of two of said slats when the latter are positioned above and/or laterally to said base in the laying condition, to constrain said slats to said base.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">In an advantageous embodiment, said lateral appendages have an inclined shape and diverge from each other in the direction approaching said base, to facilitate the snap-entry thereof in said longitudinal grooves of said slats.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">Preferably, said lateral appendages project from opposite parts of said rotatable body and are aligned with each other.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment, said system comprises thrust means adapted to exert, during the removal of two of said slats previously positioned above and/or laterally to said base in the laying condition, and during a rotation of said rotatable body from said retaining position to said release position, a thrust on said slats in the direction away from said base. This solution facilitates the release of the slats from the base.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0066">Preferably, said thrust means comprise one or more cam, or inclined plane or helical surfaces, projecting radially from said rotatable body and configured to interact with an edge of said slats facing, with said slats in the laying condition, towards said base, for pushing, during the rotation of said rotatable body from said retaining position to said release position, said edge from the side opposite said base.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0067">In advantageous embodiments, said system comprises further retaining means of said rotatable body configured to prevent the separation thereof from said base even when said rotatable body is in said release position; this solution facilitates the transport of the system according to the disclosure, since there is no risk of losing the rotatable body, and also facilitates the laying thereof, since the rotatable body remains constrained to the base during laying.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0068">Advantageously, the system comprises supporting means of at least one of two of said slats positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition, adapted to prevent or limit the bending of said at least one slat towards said base.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">Advantageously, said supporting means comprise at least one bridge structure defined by two legs, projecting from said base and spaced mutually apart, connected above by a crosspiece which defines, on the part opposite said base, an abutment surface adapted to be positioned between said base and a portion of one of two of said slats positioned above and/or laterally to said base in said laying condition, to prevent or limit the deformation of said portion towards said base.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">The bridge structure, interposing between the overlying slat and the base, reduces the risk that this slat bends, or bends beyond a certain limit, even if it is subjected to pressures of relatively high entities, such as for example that exerted by the heel of a shoe, thus reducing the risk of breakage.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">Furthermore, the bridge structure, thanks to the legs thereof, optimally discharges the stresses exerted by the overlying slat on the base, from which these forces are discharged onto the flat surface to which the base is associated.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">Furthermore, the bridge structure has a high resistance to stress, while maintaining a low weight; the system thus obtained therefore maintains a low weight, and also a limited production cost, requiring less material, for example, compared to a structure in which the bridge element is replaced by a solid wall. Furthermore, the system according to the disclosure allows an easy laying, allowing to fasten, in a first step, all the bases to one or more flat surfaces, and in a second step fasten all the slats thereto.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">Preferably, said supporting means comprise two of said bridge structures, spaced mutually apart, each configured to be arranged with the respective said abutment surface between said base and a portion of respectively two of said slats positioned above and/or laterally to said base in the laying condition, to prevent or limit the deformation of said portion towards said base.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">Preferably, said two crosspieces of said two bridge structures are connected together by one or more transverse elements; these transverse elements increase the mechanical resistance of the structure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">Advantageously, said abutment surface of said crosspieces is substantially flat, parallel and spaced from said base; in this manner the support action on the overlying slat is more uniform and balanced.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">Advantageously, said one or more transverse elements each define an abutment surface, parallel to and spaced from said base, and substantially coplanar to said abutment surface defined by said crosspieces.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">Preferably, said retaining means of said rotatable body configured to prevent the separation of said rotatable body from said base when said rotatable body is rotated in said retaining position are formed in one piece and/or at least partially coincide with said supporting means; this configuration reduces the complexity and the number of components of the system according to the disclosure, thus keeping the weight and production costs thereof reduced.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">In a preferred embodiment, said retaining means of said rotatable body configured to prevent the separation of said rotatable body from said base when said rotatable body is rotated in said retaining position comprise said at least one bridge structure, said rotatable body being configured to be arranged, in said retaining position, at least
