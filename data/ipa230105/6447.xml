In particular, the invention is suitable for managing, in an integrated and optimized way, the use and transfer of energy among users that are equipped with generation, accumulation and consumption elements, wherein said users are connected to an external distribution grid, which is generally a public or a private grid, and are virtually or substantially aggregated one other to form energy communities having variable configuration and aims. The proposed solution allows to manage an unlimited number of energy communities with an unlimited number of energy nodes dynamically aggregated over the time, by automatically adapting to the virtual or substantial aggregation perimeter of each energy community, to the variable conditions of participation of the nodes and to the variable equipment of each node. The invention simplifies the creation and the management of new energy communities by a general provider or a specific aggregation administrator, and also simplifies the entry and exit of a single user in/from energy communities, to temporarily participate in the same and in a customizable way.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In principle, nowadays the most evolved and advantageous solutions to exchange energy between active users called prosumer and/or proconstomer and/or constorer namely, respectively, producer-consumer and producer-consumer-storer and consumer-storer, are typically applied to single users, which are interconnected one another through a one-to-one type of dynamics, where a user produces and backs energy to the external grid that redistributes or accumulates it; this one-to-one dynamics can be reformulated on multiple interconnected users, in such a way as to form a local energy grid, also called micro-grid, where energy and information exchanges occur between the above-mentioned active users, called nodes, generally with the aim of balancing flows and/or reducing the draw offs from the exterior, thus triggering a one-to-many dynamics. In these cases, the logics of management of said grid are directed to the advantage and the optimization of the single node, or are directed to the relation existing between a node and the external distribution grid to which it is possibly connected. By way of example only, refer to the advantageous solution of the one-to-one type in EP2917991B1 (Spotti), where a particular node controller is connected to the controllers of the others nodes and manages, with shared programs, the production, consumption and accumulation devices of its node, in such a way as to create an advantageous local grid of the self-configurable type; also in this case, however, the optimization priority is directed to the single user and not to the group to which it belongs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It was therefore found that the advantages resulting from an energy sharing system, where the exchanges are of the one-to-one type, can be economic, or concern performance and energy efficiency, but are inevitably based on the behaviour or management of a single node considered in the ensemble of its energy assets, namely its generation, accumulation and consumption elements, towards the public grid operator or an intermediary, such as an energy trader. Generally, in fact, said operator or said trader draws off purchasing, or backs selling, the exchanged energy. In particular, it has been found that said one-to-one exchange solutions are not advantageously implementable to more evolved aggregation forms, generally called energy community or EC with an acronym or called virtual power plant or VPP with an acronym, wherein multiple nodes consisting of prosumers and/or proconstomers and/or constorers of a same distribution grid, even located far one another, are virtually aggregated like a temporary community in order to share some purposes and/or energy use modes. Recently, in particular in the energy sector, the demand for new forms of aggregation has emerged, which are able to allow a greater flexibility in the forms of management and participation, and also to simultaneously consider a high number of nodes and variables.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The management system proposed by this invention overcomes the conventional one-to-one approach, which is typical of local grids with nodes close one another and aggregated in a stable way, providing energy communities with nodes aggregated in a variable way and dynamics of exchange between the nodes that are of the one-to-many type and also of the many-to-many type. Essentially, an innovative system for managing, in an integrated and simplified way, multiple energy communities with variable configuration is proposed, with logics of management that aim in turn at optimizing both the relation between said energy communities and the nodes composing them, and the relation between single energy communities and said external grid to which they are connected. The invention is suitable for the management and exchange of electrical power, but also for heat or gas energy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, in a complex system made up of elements that interact by continuously changing themselves, the difficulty in simultaneously managing multiple variable is widely known. More in detail in the energy sector, by way of example only, just consider the difficulty of managing energy flows among a high number of users aggregated in temporary groups, of said VPP or EC type, when the membership and/or modes of participation to a group are frequently modifiable, both by a service provider and by a single user or node. It may, in fact, occur that a user intends to change from one group to another to enjoy the benefits offered by a different group, or due to changings to technological devices or any changed condition within or outside the group. In particular, nowadays, there is a need for a shared and customizable management system for nodes aggregated according to one-to-many and/or many-to-many dynamics, with group priority rather than single user, and able to simultaneously consider the multiple variable existing both at a group and node level, in order to then adapt the instructions to be imparted to the different devices of each single node.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, thanks to the recent diffusion of new technologies for the production and the distributed accumulation of renewable energy and also to promote a greater liberalization of energy market, it has been noticed a urgent need to overcome the traditional models of centralized distribution for the purpose of creating new and advantageous models of variable aggregation, which are also suitable to facilitate the creation of energy communities having a variable and non-continuous perimeter, that is virtual, in such a way as to allow a node to enter or exit in a simplified way in/from an energy community, depending on its own convenience, or group convenience or both, and also to freely change its own mode of participation in the group. However, it has been found that this distribution and grouping model requires an improved management system as regards known and conventional ones, which is able to simultaneously consider said node and group variables, and also able to integrate multiple different groups with different needs. Consider, by way of example only, the different needs that a single node provided with special production and/or accumulation devices can have as regards another node that temporarily requires a greater peak power, or consider the information, statistical or privacy needs that are typical of a provider that manages the IT platform used to manage said energy communities, rather than the economic or invoicing purposes the service provider that manages a single energy community may have.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has therefore been found that energy industry, nowadays, requires evolved aggregation models behaving like high complex systems, consisting of many elements in continuous evolution, like living elements, for which the known systems based on predictive and/or deterministic management are not suitable, and also pre-set algorithms, as used in closed systems with one-to-one dynamics, are not suitable. Instead, it has been found that a modern energy system, where groupings have a high degree of variability, with interaction dynamics of the one-to-many or many-to-many type, mainly requires management logics that are suitable to optimize and automatize the control of said groupings, allowing as well to customize some parameters or expected advantages.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The innovative proposed system allows to manage multiple energy communities with variable configuration in an integrated and optimized way, according to purposes that are in turn different and customizable, first in the interest of the group, as primary goal, and then in the interest of the single node participant, as secondary goal. The invention considerably simplifies the commercial and operational activity of any service provider that intends to constitute a new EC having, for example, specific energy exchange and/or use and/or marketing modes, with specific advantages at a group level; moreover, it simplifies the participation in an EC of a prosumer or proconstomer or constorer node, including multiple variables of participation modes and a customization for each user, to locally obtain specific advantages.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to determine the state of the art concerning the proposed solution, a conventional verification was carried out, querying public archives, which led to the identification of some prior art, among them:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">D1: EP2917991 (Spotti)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">D2: U.S. Ser.

For example, the management system provided in D4 allows to assign a hierarchy to some operations, but with limited possibilities to combine and manage the variables. Furthermore, is not easy for a user to change the community it belongs to; and it is also not easy for a provider to manage in real time multiple node and community configuration changes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">Moreover, as a consequence of the above, there are important technological difficulties for a service provider in creating and managing new EC, with specific purposes and advantages, according to the needs of a free market in constant evolution; and yet, according to this new approach to the market of energy, where the production and accumulation resources are connected and distributed, it is not easy for a user to aggregate to new EC exiting from a less advantageous aggregation, or even to change its participation conditions. Moreover, often, it is subjected to constrains dictated by the single hardware producers, as it happens, for example, with inverters or battery chargers or charging stations for electrical vehicles, or dictated by the different communication protocols that are in turn imposed by grid operators or energy traders.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">Furthermore, it has been found that the known solutions do not allow to manage, in an integrated way, multiple EC with variable configuration, like a complex system comprising multiple variables which are considered simultaneously and in real time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">Hence the need for enterprises in the sector to identify solutions that are more effective and versatile than the solutions currently existing; the aim of the present invention is also to avoid the described drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0034">This and other objectives are reached with the present invention according to the characteristics disclosed in the appended claims, thus solving the problems set forth by means of an adaptive system for managing, in an integrated way, multiple EC with variable configuration (EC<b>1</b>-ECn), with prosumer and/or proconstomer and/or constorer nodes (<b>100</b>) dynamically aggregated over the time, through a digital platform (<b>200</b>) that can be partitioned and includes logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) for automatic management. Each portion of the platform (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>) corresponds to an EC and to an oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) of logics in turn selected, sequenced and parameterized according to the optimization purposes provided by the EC, to locally execute, by means of the controller (<b>101</b>) of each node, the commands imparted to its devices and optimize the energy flows, first according to the EC logics and then to those of the single node. Said oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) is constantly recalculated, within 50 milliseconds from the reading of the data of each aggregated node, in order to adapt in real-time to the variable configuration of an EC and its nodes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Aims</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0035">In this way, through the considerable creative contribution, the effect of which has allowed to reach a considerable technical progress, some objectives and advantages are achieved by solving the main problems highlighted above and, in particular, by improving the management of energy exchanges between a high number of active and distributed users that are connected to an external distribution grid to physically convey energy, and are also interconnected through an Internet services platform suitable to share information, software programs and operating modes, in order to temporarily aggregate in EC with variable configuration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">A first the aim of the present invention is to manage, in an integrated and optimized way, the transfer of energy between prosumer and/or proconstomer connected to an external distribution grid, which are virtually aggregated one another in such a way as to form one or more energy communities. In particular, the dispatching of a power source by a centralized body or a service provider is simplified, and also the participation of the single user in an exchange community offering particular advantages is simplified. The proposed management system is intended to overcome the known limits of local grids, where energy exchanges between the nodes are of the one-to-one type, allowing instead advantageous exchange dynamics of the one-to-many and also many-to-many type, according to an innovative management system based on multiple automatic management logics, which are prioritized in sequence according to a degree of importance, like a weighed sequence.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0037">A second objective of the present invention is to allow an automatic and integrated management of one or more energy communities having a variable configuration, wherein the single nodes can be dynamically aggregated over the time, thus modifying their virtual perimeter, and they can also participate with customized modes and aims. In particular, the proposed system for managing said energy community is of the adaptive type, thus continuously and automatically modifies and prioritizes the principles underlying all energy exchanges in such a way as to continuously re-consider said variables; said prioritization, therefore, has as its main purpose the optimization of the advantages at a group level, that is said energy community, and consequently optimizes the advantages at a local level if provided by the participating node.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0038">Another objective of the present invention, advantageous as regards the known solutions, consists in the simultaneous implementation and coexistence of different configurable and parametric management logics, made available and shared within an internet IT platform, in a protected operational mode of the cloud service type, to be easily controlled by said centralized body or external service provider, with the aim of dispatching and data analysis, and may also be accessible by said single user to manage its aggregation modes.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039">A further objective of the present invention is to provide an extremely rapid management system wherein energy exchanges and the management logics that underlie exchange operations are continually recalculated for the entire energy community. Specifically, the proposed system allows to complete a complete re-calculation of said management logics in less than 50 milliseconds, starting from the reading of the data of each node belonging, at that moment, to the perimeter of the energy community, to then locally implement the single commands imparted to the different nodes. Essentially, therefore, the proposed management system can be considered as an instantaneous system type, otherwise known as &#x201c;in real time&#x201d;, so as to adapt automatically to the continuous variations detected in a group such as, for example, the virtual aggregation perimeter of each EC or VPP, participation conditions of each node and/or the specific equipment of each node.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040">These and other advantages will appear from the following detailed description of some preferred embodiments, with the aid of the attached schematic drawings whose execution details are not to be considered as limiting, but only illustrative.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">CONTENT OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows, by way of non-limiting example, an active energy node of said prosumer and/or proconstomer and/or constorer type, which is connected to an external energy distribution grid UT; said node is provided with multiple devices for the production and/or accumulation and/or consumption and/or use of energy, and is also provided with a node controller of smart type that directly manages the nodes and also is connected to a digital platform, like a gateway, and to a smart meter physically connected to said external grid UT.

It should be noted that these advantages are economical, energetic or in terms of use of the service, and can be locally distributed to the single members of said energy community, namely said nodes, or to third parties which are pre-set or established in turn as it happens for example in the case of bidding, or to other energy communities.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0089">More in operational detail of the proposed management system, it is envisaged that each node (<b>100</b>) is connected to said energy distribution grid (UT) for a bi-directional exchange of electrical or thermal energy or gas, and has installed at least one meter of the smart type (<b>102</b>) which is able to measure these energy variables entering and exiting said distribution grid, such as a smart meter according to the European MID standard, and which interfaces with said node controller (<b>101</b>) to share the information required to manage of the entire energy community and its node. Each node (<b>100</b>), therefore, has an Internet connection that allows said node controller (<b>101</b>) to connect in a bi-directional way to an IT services platform (<b>200</b>) of the type called cloud service, which includes programs for the management of said energy communities (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) and wherein, in particular, the aforementioned logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) are included.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0090">According to the purposes of the invention, said IT services platform (<b>200</b>, L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) is advantageously partitionable depending on a specific energy community, providing platform portions (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>) corresponding to said aggregation of nodes (<b>100</b>), namely providing a portion assigned to each energy community (EC<b>1</b>-ECn), where in each portion said community logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) are in turn re-combined and ordered in a specific oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn), namely selected and parameterized in a differentiated way, according to the optimization purposes provided for each energy community. Each oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) of logics corresponds to a weighed sequence that is implemented to the single aggregated node, where every logic adopted by the energy community and/or its aggregated node is assigned a diversified degree (W).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0091">Each oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) is made available and active, in a mode called cloud processing, in one of said platform portions (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>), to be used and possibly customized (LL) by the nodes (<b>100</b>) that are connected to it, namely aggregated to the corresponding energy community (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>, EC<b>1</b>, CL<b>1</b>) (<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>, ECn, CLn). In this way, it is easier to create and manage an energy community independently from the management of other aggregations, where a third party called Service Provider (SP<b>1</b>-SPn) can create and manage a new energy community (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) by activating an oriented combination of logics (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) corresponding to the same, and then giving to each entering node (<b>100</b>) the authorization to aggregate. Consequently, it can connect upon authorized accreditation to the corresponding platform portions (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>) where said combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) is active in cloud processing mode, which is shared by all the nodes (<b>100</b>) aggregated to the same energy community (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) and is also partially customizable in such a way as to locally optimize (LL, W) the advantages provided for the group (LG, W), according to specific purposes or advantages required for its own node.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0092">Each oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn, LG, W) is prevailing as regards said internal management programs (LL, W) of a node (<b>100</b>), which implements the commands imparted by the combination of logics to said devices for the production, accumulation and/or consumption of energy, by means of said node controller (<b>101</b>) that continuously reads and sends data about its own node according to at least one monitoring logic, receives said commands and consequently checks said devices, thus actively participating in the management of an EC.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0093">In particular, the management system proposed for energy communities EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) with variable configuration is fast and integrated, with said management logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) being made available in an IT platform (<b>200</b>) which is partitionable (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>), where they are in turn re-combined in an oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) of logics activated in cloud processing mode; each platform portion (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>) corresponds to a specific EC and a specific oriented combination. In particular, said logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) are made available in said digital platform (<b>200</b>) in a neutral form, namely not selected, not sequenced and not parametrized, by a technology-platform provider (TPP) that manages the entire digital platform (<b>200</b>, L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>) at an upper level, that is at system level, as master. Said logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>5</b>), therefore, at an intermediate level of the digital platform (<b>200</b>), namely in correspondence of said platform portion (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>, EC<b>1</b>-ECn), are in turn selected, sequenced and parametrized as oriented combinations (CL<b>1</b>-CLn), depending on the optimization purposes provided for each EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0094">Operationally, said oriented combinations (CL<b>1</b>-CLn) of logics are continuously recalculated, namely within 50 milliseconds from the reading of the data of each node, thus adapting in real time to its variable configuration and to that of all the other aggregated nodes. In this way it is possible, at said upper level or master, to centralize the information of all energy communities EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) for example for analytical, statistical or control purposes, compliant to privacy regulations, and also third parties, such as said service providers (SP<b>1</b>-SPn) or aggregation administrators, at an intermediate or community level, are helped in the creation and/or separate management of an unlimited number of EC with configuration variable (EC<b>1</b>-ECn), each with its own purposes and participation modes (CL<b>1</b>-CLn). Moreover, at a lower level of use, namely at node level, it is possible for any user that is equipped with said energy production, accumulation and/or consumption devices, which can possibly be modifiable, and that has previously signed up or is pre-accredited in said IT platform (<b>200</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>), to enter or exit, with an extreme operational freedom, in/from said aggregation perimeter of an EC with configuration variable, as the perimeter is substantially virtual, by using the same controller and the same interface devices. This system integration, like energy macro-community, is not available nowadays and is increasingly required by the free market of energy supply, wherein the above-mentioned variability of aggregation can occur frequently, depending on particular economic or energetic purposes or other purposes, such as when a service provider (SP<b>1</b>-SPn) creates a new energy community (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) that offers more advantageous energy distribution conditions for specific time slots or more advantageous invoicing conditions or other advantages and promotions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0095">Therefore, in said macro-community of energy nodes (<b>100</b>) pre-accredited at said upper level of the digital platform (<b>200</b>, TPP), each single node (<b>100</b>) is independent and free to aggregate, at any time, to any EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn), entering and exiting from a platform portion (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>) corresponding to the same, by means of the same controller (<b>101</b>) and the same wirings, the same connections and the same programs, by means of which it (<b>100</b>) can, through said digital platform (<b>200</b>), request the change of EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn) and automatically receive, from the aggregation administrator or service provider (SPn-SP<b>1</b>), additional IT integrations that allow it to automatically aggregate as an active node. These IT integrations include at least one accreditation that gives direct access to the corresponding platform portion (<b>200</b>/<b>1</b>-<b>200</b>/<i>n</i>, EC<b>1</b>-ECn) and to the corresponding oriented combination (CL<b>1</b>-CLn), it being automatically operational, in cloud processing mode, to be shared by all the controllers (<b>101</b>) of the nodes (<b>100</b>) that are temporarily aggregated to said EC (EC<b>1</b>-ECn).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0096">Furthermore, from an operational and functional point of view, the proposed management system achieves the relevant advantage, as regards the known and conventional solutions for managing energy flows between users grouped in networks and/or community, of allowing the simultaneous implementation and coexistence of different configurable and parametric management logics, within a section of a partitionable IT platform that operates in cloud processing mode.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0097">Moreover, with the proposed system, said ordered combinations of logics described above are easily re-calculated for the entire EC in real time, here operationally intended as a time equal to or lower than 50 milliseconds from the reading of the data of each node belonging, at that moment, to its perimeter. The implementation of the single commands imparted to the single devices of the node occurs by means of the node controller (<b>101</b>), which is of smart type and suitable for the bi-directional communication such as, for example, said node controller called Snocu.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0098">With the proposed management system, therefore, each node controller (<b>101</b>) plays an active role as regards the energy assets of the entire EC. In the event said node controller (<b>101</b>) temporary fails to connect to the Internet, the node proceeds according to local optimization logics with pre-set node algorithms, according to energy exchange dynamics, also called stand-alone or one-to-one, though still being connected to the external power grid. Essentially, the participation of that node in the logics and dynamics of the EC is expected to be suspended until a later connection; then, for data logging and reporting purposes, the same node controller (<b>101</b>) stores in a local memory the data concerning energy behaviours of the single node, in such a way that when it will re-connect, they will be transmitted to the servers (<b>113</b>) of the digital platform (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0099">The proposed management solution provides that traceability, accounting and final balancing of the performances generated and accrued by an EC, are carried out according to techniques and practices that can use conventional or even more advances technologies, such as the technology called blockchain or other. Moreover, the different reporting, logging, invoicing and data analysis activities can be performed as typical services implementable according to existing methods and regulations.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0100">More in detail of said management logics (L<b>1</b>-L<b>15</b>), the monitoring logics (L<b>1</b>), or LMO, provide for monitoring at least one performance and/or a level. The monitoring of performances occurs for a selected period of time, for example by day, week, month, year or fraction thereof, with reference to:<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0101">flow quantities, such as energy produced, energy consumed, accumulator charge/discharge cycles, self-consumption, self-sufficiency, accrued savings, economical balance as regards to a selected pricing plan or other;</li>        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0102">and/or instantaneous status quantities, such as instantaneous power demanded from the external grid, batteries soc intended as acronym of state of charge, self-consumption, self-sufficiency or other.<br/>The monitoring of the level, instead, refers to:</li>        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0103">single user, as an absolute value;</li>        <li id="ul0013-0004" num="0104">and/or single user compared to a reference value, like a target, which is calculated based on the equipment the node in question is provided with, through an algorithm based on the configuration of the devices of the single node;</li>        <li id="ul0013-0005" num="0105">and/or single user compared to a significant reference period, like a target, where for example the monthly performances are compared to the previous month or the same month of the previous year;</li>        <li id="ul0013-0006" num="0106">and/or single user compared to average aggregate of the performances of the energy community to which it belongs, in such a way as to understand if the node is the best performer within the community or in the average or sub-performing;</li>        <li id="ul0013-0007" num="0107">and/or energy community, considered at a level of average aggregate of the performances of the nodes composing that energy community to which the node belongs to, as regards to other communities identified within a given radius of kilometric distance.

Such a logic shall, therefore, be configured with precision as regards hardware devices with which the single nodes are equipped, in particular generators and accumulators, depending on the peaks and measurements of consumption considered within all the nodes that are simultaneously aggregated. Furthermore, it should be noted that such a logic can be administered according to specific purposes, other than those that are mentioned above, such as keeping an energy reserve that can be supplied to the external grid operator in case of request, or keep an increasing or lowering energy reserve to sell or put in a local grid included in an EC, for a given period of time, due to a specific need and request from the external grid operator.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0128">Such alternative logics are easily implementable by means of said digital platform (<b>200</b>), where they can also be integrated subsequently as regards the initial installation, providing that all or part of devices that constitute the equipment of the single nodes of an EC are configurable in a parametric way, with the values required to obtain the desired reserves. Therefore, if during standard operation of the single nodes of an EC, specific and pre-set request codes are received via said digital platform (<b>200</b>), which are transmitted by the external grid operator or by the system provider that administers the system at an upper level or by the service provider that administers said EC at an intermediate level, LBA logics are implemented, which are different than said native logics suitable to maximize self-sufficiency.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0129">Said peak-shaving logics (L<b>5</b>) or LPS, allow to unintentionally exceed, within the same node, a power threshold which is pre-set by contract or for a specific equipment configuration; the invention provides that this overcoming is opportunely balanced using the energy reserve that characterizes the node, based on its energy storage devices, or using the energy reserve of appropriately selected neighbouring nodes, according to an optimization algorithm for community peak-shaving.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0130">Then, within the single node, by means of said digital platform (<b>200</b>) and with a user application or a user portal, it is possible to modify the use profile of energy consumed by implementing power boost logics (L<b>6</b>), or LPB, on the basis of which the node in question becomes intentionally more energy consuming than normally configured for a given schedulable period. Said power boost logics will then perform guided accumulation discharges of the node and of the neighbouring nodes in order to meet this need, preserving as much as possible the target purposes that underlie the community.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0131">Said maximization of accumulator life logics (L<b>7</b>), or LDA, are provided to maximize the residual life of the accumulators of the single nodes of an EC, and consequently the residual life of the aggregated accumulators of the energy community as a whole, being specific and dedicated logics that perform, by rotation and according to a pre-set schedule, forced and guided cycles of full discharge and full charge of the single accumulators, then keeping them then charged and inactive for a given period of time. This behaviour helps to extend the residual life of each single accumulator and in conclusion the residual life of the accumulation capacity of an EC as a whole. During the forced discharge and charge cycle of a single accumulator, that node will use the accumulation capacity supplied by the remaining EC.

Moreover, each single node or the entire EC can activate, according to the current regulations in force in the country, specific energy arbitration logics (L<b>11</b>) and therefore, based on the reference pricing agreement, buy or to sell energy from/to the external grid when an economical advantage is obtained for the single node or for the entire community.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0142">Said awarding logics (L<b>12</b>), or LPR, are conceived in such a way that, within an EC, specific energy behaviours may be established, such as investments in renewable generation and/or accumulation, or period performances that can accrue bonuses; by way of example, consider bonuses quantifiable in KWh or in currency or other advantages.
