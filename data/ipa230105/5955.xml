id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Some embodiments include methods of forming integrated assemblies. A conductive structure is formed to include a semiconductor-containing material over a metal-containing material. An opening is formed to extend into the conductive structure. A conductive material is formed along a bottom of the opening. A stack of alternating first and second materials is formed over the conductive structure either before or after forming the conductive material. Insulative material and/or channel material is formed to extend through the stack to contact the conductive material. Some embodiments include integrated assemblies.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="164.42mm" wi="158.75mm"

Flash memory is one type of memory, and has numerous uses in modern computers and devices. For instance, modern personal computers may have BIOS stored on a flash memory chip. As another example, it is becoming increasingly common for computers and other devices to utilize flash memory in solid state drives to replace conventional hard drives. As yet another example, flash memory is popular in wireless electronic devices because it enables manufacturers to support new communication protocols as they become standardized, and to provide the ability to remotely upgrade the devices for enhanced features.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">NAND may be a basic architecture of flash memory, and may be configured to comprise vertically-stacked memory cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Before describing NAND specifically, it may be helpful to more generally describe the relationship of a memory array within an integrated arrangement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a prior art device <b>1000</b> which includes a memory array <b>1002</b> having a plurality of memory cells <b>1003</b> arranged in rows and columns along with access lines <b>1004</b> (e.g., wordlines to conduct signals WL<b>0</b> through WLm) and first data lines <b>1006</b> (e.g., bitlines to conduct signals BL<b>0</b> through BLn).

A row decoder <b>1007</b> and a column decoder <b>1008</b> decode address signals AO through AX on address lines <b>1009</b> to determine which ones of the memory cells <b>1003</b> are to be accessed. A sense amplifier circuit <b>1015</b> operates to determine the values of information read from the memory cells <b>1003</b>. An I/O circuit <b>1017</b> transfers values of information between the memory array <b>1002</b> and input/output (I/O) lines <b>1005</b>.
