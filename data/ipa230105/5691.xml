The disclosure of the Japanese Patent Application No. 2020-042232 is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to electromagnetic relay devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical electromagnetic relay devices are configured to cause a plunger and a movable member, which has at least one movable contact, to reciprocate based on electromagnetic attractive force generated by an energized solenoid to thereby cause the at least one movable contact to abut onto at least one stationary contact or separate therefrom. Abutment of the at least one movable contact onto the at least one stationary contact of such a typical electromagnetic relay enables the typical electromagnetic relay to be turned on, and separation of the at least one movable contact from the at least one stationary contact of such a typical electromagnetic relay enables the typical electromagnetic relay to be turned off.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electromagnetic relay device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2007-109470 includes a solenoid chamber in which a solenoid is disposed, and a contact chamber in which a first pair of a stationary contact and a movable contact and a second pair of a stationary contact and a movable contact are located. The electromagnetic relay device disclosed in the above patent publication also includes a diaphragm that partitions the solenoid chamber and the contact chamber from each other. This partitioning configuration aims to inhibit foreign particles in the solenoid chamber from entering the contact chamber.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The reciprocation of the plunger causes the diaphragm to be deformed, so that the diaphragm imparts a resistance to the reciprocation of the plunger. This results in the reciprocation speed of the plunger being likely to decrease. From this viewpoint, although the published patent document has proposed measures against the decrease in the reciprocation speed of the plunger, the existence of the diaphragm may make it difficult to resolve the decrease in the reciprocation speed of the plunger. This may therefore make it difficult to eliminate a detrimental effect on speedy on-off operation of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the circumstances set forth above, one aspect of the present disclosure seeks to provide electromagnetic relay devices, each of which is capable of inhibiting foreign particles from entering between a pair of at least one stationary contact and at least one movable contact while reducing a detrimental effect on switching operations of the corresponding one of the electromagnetic relay devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first exemplary measure of the present disclosure is an electromagnetic relay device. The electromagnetic relay device includes a mover including a movable contact movable to abut onto and separate from a stationary contact through a contact region defined between the movable contact and the stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a plunger configured to cause the mover to reciprocate to accordingly cause the movable contact to abut onto or separate from the stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a solenoid unit configured to cause the plunger to reciprocate in a predetermined reciprocation direction. The solenoid unit includes an electromagnetic coil configured to generate magnetic flux when energized, and a movable core having a slidable contact portion that has an outer peripheral surface. The movable core is configured to reciprocate based on energization of the electromagnetic coil. The solenoid unit includes a support member configured to slidably support the outer peripheral surface of the slidable contact portion of the movable core.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The electromagnetic relay device includes a movable wall member located between the slidable contact portion and the contact region. The movable wall member is linked to the plunger and configured to reciprocate together with the plunger. The movable wall member is arranged to occupy a region in the electromagnetic relay device. The region contains at least the slidable contact portion when viewed in the reciprocation direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second exemplary measure of the present disclosure is an electromagnetic relay device. The electromagnetic relay device includes a mover including a movable contact movable to abut onto and separate from a stationary contact. The mover has a center and an outer periphery. The electromagnetic relay device includes a plunger configured to cause the mover to reciprocate to accordingly cause the movable contact to abut onto or separate from the stationary contact. The electromagnetic relay device includes a solenoid unit configured to cause the plunger to reciprocate in a predetermined reciprocation direction. The mover is located to be farther from the solenoid unit than the stationary contact is, and has a major surface that faces the solenoid unit.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The solenoid unit includes an electromagnetic coil configured to generate magnetic flux when energized, and a movable core having an outer peripheral surface and configured to reciprocate based on energization of the electromagnetic coil. The solenoid unit includes a support member configured to slidably support the outer peripheral surface of the movable core. The electromagnetic relay device includes a stationary-contact support configured to support the stationary contact and having a through hole formed therethrough. The plunger penetrates through the through hole. The electromagnetic relay device includes an inward wall mounted on the major surface of the mover to face inward. The inward wall is located closer to the outer periphery of the mover than the through hole is, and is located closer to the center of the mover than the movable contact is.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The movable wall member of the electromagnetic relay device according to the first exemplary measure is arranged to occupy the region in the electromagnetic relay device. The region contains at least the slidable contact portion when viewed in the reciprocation direction. This arrangement keeps, even if there are foreign particles at the slidable contact portion, the foreign particles from moving toward the contact region, thus inhibiting the foreign particles from entering into the contact region. In particular, the movable wall member is configured to reciprocate together with the plunger. This configuration reduces a detrimental effect due to the arrangement of the movable wall member on reciprocation of the plunger, making it possible to reduce a detrimental effect due to the arrangement of the movable wall member on speedy switching operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inward wall is mounted on the rearward major surface of the mover. Therefore, even if foreign particles at the slidable contact portion move onto the mover through the through hole of the stationary-contact support, the inward wall keeps the foreign particles from moving outward toward a contact region defined between the stationary contact and the movable contact. This therefore inhibits the foreign particles from entering into the contact region.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, the inward wall is configured to reciprocate together with the mover. This configuration reduces a detrimental effect due to the configuration of the inward wall on reciprocation of the mover, making it possible to reduce a detrimental effect due to the configuration of the inward wall on speedy switching operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, the electromagnetic relay device according to each of the first and second exemplary measures keeps foreign particles from moving toward the contact region while reducing a detrimental effect on switching operations of the electromagnetic relay device.</p><p

This causes the electromagnetic relay device <b>1</b> to be switched on.

Because the biasing force of the forward biasing member <b>13</b> is set to be larger than the biasing force of the rearward biasing member <b>14</b> according to the first embodiment, the forward biasing member <b>13</b> causes the movable core <b>51</b> to move in the forward direction due to there being no magnetic attractive force between the movable core <b>51</b> and the stationary core <b>52</b>. The forward movement of the movable core <b>51</b> causes the plunger <b>2</b> to push the mover <b>3</b> in the forward direction, so that the mover <b>3</b> moves away from the stationary contacts <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">This results in the movable contacts <b>31</b> being separated from the respective stationary contacts <b>41</b>.
