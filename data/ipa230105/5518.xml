In some examples, a subword driver block of a memory device includes a plurality of subword drivers each having an output configured to be coupled to a word line coupled to a plurality of memory cells. The outputs of a first subword driver and a second subword driver of the plurality of subword drivers are coupled to a common transistor and a common word driver line, where the first subword driver and the second subword driver are respectively coupled to a first main word line and a second main word line. In such configuration, the first and second subword drivers are coupled in cascade connection so that, responsive to an active first main word line and an inactive common word driver line, a non-active potential is provided to the first subword driver from the second subword driver via the common transistor.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

The semiconductor memory device may include hierarchically structured main word lines (MWL) and word lines. The main word line is driven by a respective main word driver and is positioned at an upper hierarchy, and is selected by a first portion of a row address. The word line is driven by a respective subword driver and is positioned at a lower hierarchy, and is selected based on a corresponding main word line and a word driver line (EX) selected by a second portion of the row address.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to the scaling down of array access devices in semiconductor fabrication, there is a desire to reduce the number of transistors in a memory device. For example, reducing the number of transistors in subword drivers and/or improving the layout design of the same has become desirable in reducing the die size of the memory

An address signal may be provided to the memory device with the ACT signal to select a main word driver and a subword driver for activation. For example, the main word line MWLB may transition to an active state (e.g., a low potential VSS in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), the state on the word driver line FXT<b>0</b> may become active high, and the word driver line FXB<b>0</b> may become active low.

Responsive, at least in part to the precharge signal PRE, the word driver associated with FXT<b>0</b> may be deactivated, and the word driver line FXT<b>0</b> may be decoupled from the VCCP. As the potential on the FXT<b>0</b> line decreases, the state of the main word line MWLB is still low. The word line WL is pulled down by the p-channel type transistor <b>508</b> to a lower voltage so the potential on the WL line decreases.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At or around time T<b>2</b>, the word driver line FXB<b>0</b> may be inactive and becomes high. This causes the n-channel type transistor <b>514</b> to turn on and pull down the potential on the word line WL faster toward the non-active potential VNWL at or around time T<b>3</b>. This is possible because the common transistor <b>514</b> is coupled to the subword driver <b>504</b> associated with a different main word line MWLBn+1. At this time, the main word line MWLBn coupled to the subword driver <b>502</b> is still active (e.g., at logic low), while other main word lines, such as MWLBn+1, are unselected (e.g., at logic high).

The operation of reducing the voltage of the word line WL<b>0</b> by decreasing FXT<b>0</b> during the pre-charge at the intermediate point mitigates a row hammer issue that might occur in a memory device. Further, this operation reduces the voltage difference across the source/drain (VDS) for the n-channel type transistor <b>506</b>.

In other words, two transistors (e.g., <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>) need to be turned on in order to pull down the word line WLm to VNWL. However, this reduction of driving ability may be mitigated by deactivating the main word line MWLB of the subword driver sooner, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The degree of the reduction of the amplitude in FXB<b>0</b> may depend on the precharge time margin. For example, a wider precharge time margin may allow a lower amplitude to be provided to the FXB<b>0</b> signal.

For a subword driver associated with a selected main word line, the supply of non-active potential VNWL from its own circuit is cut off because the n-channel type transistor is turned off (due to the active selected main word line). If the FXT provided to the subword driver is inactive, however, a non-potential VNWL is nonetheless supplied to the word line to prevent the word line from floating.

In another example, common transistors Q<b>14</b>, Q<b>15</b> included in different subword drivers are formed in cascade connections between drains/sources at outputs of different subword drivers, which are respectively coupled to word lines in a similar manner as Q<b>14</b>, Q<b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> are formed. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the common transistors Q<b>14</b>, Q<b>15</b> also correspond to transistors Q<b>14</b>, Q<b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-C</figref>, the layout <b>1300</b> also becomes symmetric. This may provide advantages in optimizing the layout design of the circuit. In addition, when the n-channel type area is between two p-channel type areas, the p-type well can be separated from other regions, so that the back bias of the n-channel type area can be changed from VBB (&#x2212;0.5V) to VSS, A shallow back bias may provide the advantage of improving the resistance to hot carriers in the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>13</b></figref> provide various advantages in reduce the memory die size over conventional subword drivers. For examples, common transistors in adjacent subword drivers are placed between outputs of the adjacent subword drivers, which configuration reduces the number of transistors in the subword driver block from an average of three transistors per subword driver to 2.5 transistors per subword driver. This reduction of the number of transistors results in a reduction of layout space. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>(A-C) provide various configurations of the layout of subword driver block with routing and placement of wiring that may be advantageous in minimizing the complexity and waste of space in the layout design.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
