The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of bioreactors configured to generate functional lung tissue that can be used to provide a more realistic environment for growth of functional airway organs ready for transplantation into humans and other animals. The lung tissue is generated over a given matrix, e.g., an artificial or decellularized lung tissue matrix. The present invention is further based on the use of this realistic environment for the preservation, repair, and modification of donor organs over prolonged periods of time in order to provide more, improved, and individualized grafts for transplantation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, a &#x201c;functional&#x201d; lung tissue performs most or all of the functions of a normal healthy lung, e.g., allows for transportation of oxygen from the air into the bloodstream, and the release of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the air. It can humidify inhaled air, produce surfactant to decrease surface tension in the alveoli, and/or produce and transport mucus to remove inhaled particulate matter from the distal to the proximal airway.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;decellularized&#x201d; and &#x201c;acellular&#x201d; are used or defined as the complete or near complete absence of detectable intracellular matter, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and nuclei in histologic sections using standard histological staining procedures. Preferably, but not necessarily, residual cell debris also has been removed from the decellularized organ or tissue.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Decellularized Tissue/Organ Matrices</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments of the present methods, lung tissue is generated over a decellularized matrix. Methods and materials for a preparing a decellularized lung tissue matrix are known in the art, as discussed below. Any appropriate materials can be used to prepare such a matrix. In a preferred embodiment, a tissue matrix can be an acellular tissue scaffold developed from decellularized lung tissue. For example, tissue such as a human lung, e.g., one or a pair of human lungs or portions thereof, e.g., human, porcine, bovine, primate, or ovine cadaveric lungs or portions thereof, can be decellularized by an appropriate method to remove native cells from the tissue while maintaining morphological integrity and vasculature of the tissue or tissue portion and preserving extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Methods for decellularizing mammalian lung tissues are described, e.g., in O'Neill J D et al., Decellularization of human and porcine lung tissues for pulmonary tissue engineering. <i>Ann Thorac Surg. </i>2013 September; 96(3):1046-55; Nichols J E et al., Production and assessment of decellularized pig and human lung scaffolds, <i>Tissue Eng Part A. </i>2013 September; 19 (17-18):2045-62; Gilpin S E et al., Perfusion decellularization of human and porcine lungs: Bringing the matrix to clinical scale. <i>Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation. In press; Song J J et al., Bioartificial lung engineering. Am J Transplant. </i>2012 February; 12(2):283-8; and Ott H C et al., Regeneration and orthotopic transplantation of a bioartificial lung. <i>Nat Med. </i>2010 August; 16(8):927-33 Exemplary decellularization methods can include subjecting tissue (e.g., lung tissue) to repeated freeze-thaw cycles, for example using liquid nitrogen. In other cases, a tissue can be subjected to an anionic or ionic cellular disruption medium such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polyethylene glycol (PEG), or TritonX. The tissue can also be treated with a nuclease solution (e.g., ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease) and washed in sterile phosphate buffered saline with mild agitation. Exemplary methods are known in the art e.g., O'Neill J D et al., Decellularization of human and porcine lung tissues for pulmonary tissue engineering. <i>Ann Thorac Surg. </i>2013 September; 96(3):1046-55. In some cases, decellularization can be performed by flushing the vessels, ducts, and/or cavities of the organ or tissue using methods and materials known in the art. For example, as described in Maghsoudlou P et al., Preservation of micro-architecture and angiogenic potential in a pulmonary acellular matrix obtained using intermittent intra-tracheal flow of detergent enzymatic treatment. <i>Biomaterials. </i>2013 September; 34(28):6638-48. Following the flushing step, the organ or tissue can be perfused via the line with a cellular disruption medium as described above for example 1% SDS in deionized water. Perfusion through the tissue can be anterograde or retrograde, and directionality can be alternated to improve perfusion efficiency. Depending upon the size and weight of an organ or tissue and the particular anionic or ionic detergent(s) and concentration of anionic or ionic detergent(s) in the cellular disruption medium, a tissue generally is perfused from about 2 to about 12 hours per gram of tissue with cellular disruption medium. Including washes, an organ may be perfused for up to about 12 to about 72 hours per gram of tissue. Perfusion generally is adjusted to physiologic conditions including flow rate and pressure, e.g., pressure between 5-100 mmHg, and flow rate between 0.1-10 times the physiologic cardiac output of the source organism or individual.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another exemplary method, a decellularization method includes perfusing a detergent, e.g., (1) 0.1% SDS (2) 2%, sodium deoxycholate (SDC), or (3) 8 mmol/liter (3)3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) (pH12) detergent, through the pulmonary artery at a constant pressure of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The protocol for all 3 detergents includes:</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">1. a 10-minute initial antegrade wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">2. detergent perfusion for the time required to visualize an opaque translucent matrix (indicative of decellularization) plus an additional 20% of that initial time (e.g., 70 minutes+14 minutes),</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">3. 15-minute deionized H<sub>2</sub>O wash, and</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">4. an additional 172-hour PBS wash with added antibiotics and antimycotics. This decellularization method, e.g., can include an additional wash of 1% Triton-X following the deionized H<sub>2</sub>O. The SDC protocol can include a 0.1% Triton-X perfusion before SDC and a 1 mol/liter NaCl wash after SDC.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similarly, porcine and human lung decellularization methods can include perfusion of a detergent or other decellularization agent though the pulmonary artery at constant pressure, followed by sequential washing with H<sub>2</sub>O, 1% Triton-X solution, and PBS. Similar to rat lungs, decellularization can be deemed complete upon visual inspection and the appearance of an opaque translucent matrix. Variability in the starting organ, mainly due to extensiveness of pre-flushing during harvest and any resulting clots can contribute to the required length of perfusion. In general, the time of decellularization perfusion can vary e.g., from 4 to 7 days.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Decellularized tissue can consist essentially (e.g., at least: 85% pure, 90% pure, 92% pure, 95% pure, 96% pure, 97% pure, 98% pure, and 99% pure by weight) of the extracellular matrix (ECM) component of all or most regions of the tissue, including ECM components of the vascular tree. ECM components can include any or all of the following: fibronectin, fibrillin, laminin, elastin, members of the collagen family (e.g., collagen I, III, and IV), glycosaminoglycans, ground substance, reticular fibers and thrombospondin, which can remain organized as defined structures such as the basal lamina. In a preferred embodiment, decellularized lung tissue matrix retains an intact vasculature. Preserving a substantially intact vasculature enables connection of the tissue matrix to a subject's vascular system upon transplantation. In addition, a decellularized tissue matrix can be further treated with, for example, irradiation (e.g., UV, gamma) to reduce or eliminate the presence of any type of microorganism remaining on or in a decellularized tissue matrix.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Methods for obtaining decellularized tissue matrices using physical, chemical, and enzymatic means are known in the art, see, e.g., Liao et al, <i>Biomaterials </i>29(8):1065-74 (2008); Gilbert et al., <i>Biomaterials </i>27(9):3675-83 (2006); Teebken et al., <i>Eur.

Methods and materials for a preparing an artificial organ matrix are known in the art. Any appropriate materials can be used to prepare such a matrix. In a preferred embodiment, an artificial organ matrix can be a scaffold developed from porous materials such as, for example, polyglycolic acid, Pluronic F-<b>127</b> (PF-<b>127</b>), Gelfoam sponge, collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG), fibrinogen-fibronectin-vitronectin hydrogel (FFVH), and elastin. See, e.g., Ingenito et al., <i>J Tissue Eng Regen Med. </i>2009 Dec. 17; Hoganson et al., <i>Pediatric Research, May </i>2008, 63(5):520-526; Chen et al., <i>Tissue Eng. </i>2005 September-October; 11(9-10):1436-48. In some cases, an artificial organ matrix can have porous structures similar to alveolar units. See Andrade et al., <i>Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. </i>2007 February; 292(2):L510-8. In some cases, an implanted artificial organ matrix can express organ-specific markers (e.g., lung-specific markers for Clara cells, pneumocytes, and respiratory epithelium). In some cases, an implanted artificial organ matrix can organize into identifiable structures (e.g., structures similar to alveoli and terminal bronchi in an artificial lung matrix). For example, an implanted artificial lung maxtrix made using FFVH can promote cell attachment, spreading and extracellular matrix expression in vitro and apparent engraftment in vivo, with evidence of trophic effects on the surrounding tissue.

For example, described in Pasque M K et al. Standardizing thoracic organ procurement for transplantation. <i>J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. </i>2010 January; 139(1):13-7. and Bribriesco A C et al Experimental models of lung transplantation. <i>Front Biosci </i>(Elite Ed). 2013 Jan. 1; 5:266-72. Any appropriate method to isolate these can be used. These donor organs can be maintained using the bioreactors described herein for a time sufficient to prepare a recipient for transplant, for a time sufficient to transport the organ to the recipient, or for a time sufficient to maintain the organ under conditions that facilitate the repair of the entire organ or portion thereof so that it is suitable for implantation.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, donor organs from human organ donors can be modified to remove endothelial lining and subsequently reseeded with recipient-derived endothelial cells to minimize immunogenicity. For example, this can be accomplished by osmotic challenge via perfusion with deionized water, perfusion with low detergent concentrations such as 0.05% Polidocanol, or perfusion with enzyme solutions such as DNAse, or collagenase. Donor organs found unsuitable for immediate transplantation due to infection, physical damage such as trauma, or ischemic damage due to prolonged hypoperfusion, or damage due to donor conditions such as brain death can be repaired using the devices and methods described herein (e.g., by mounting, perfusing, and repairing using antibiotics, cells, growth factor stimulation, and anti-inflammatory treatment). Animal-derived organs can be rendered less immunogenic by genetic and cellular modification.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some cases, donor lungs may exhibit radiographic or bronchoscopic evidence of infection. In order to control bioburden and other sources of potential infections, lungs can be mounted, e.g., on devices described herein, and flushed with antibiotic and aseptic solutions through both the vasculature and the trachea. The solution can then be suctioned from the donor lung, e.g., using bronchoscopy. This flushing procedure can be performed both before and during culture. In certain cases, a pulmonary embolism before death or blood clotting after cardiac arrest may occur, resulting in a risk of clot formation. Isolated donor organs can be mounted and retrogradely flushed via pulmonary veins to remove the clot and/or can be perfused with a thrombolytic substances to lyse any possible clot. In some cases, the donor organ may contain high levels of inflammatory cytokines and/or an inflammatory state in the alveolar macrophages in the donor lungs often related to brain death in the donor (Venkateswaran R V et al., The proinflammatory environment in potential heart and lung donors: prevalence and impact of donor management and hormonal therapy. <i>Transplantation. </i>2009 Aug. 27; 88(4):582-8). These lungs can be treated with (e.g., perfused with) anti-inflammatory drugs before and/or during organ culture. In certain cases, drugs specifically targeted at the inflammatory-cell type may be perfused. This inflammatory state can also lead to capillary leakage and increased tissue water in the donor organ as described in, for example, Venkateswaran R V et al., Measurement of extravascular lung water following human brain death: implications for lung donor assessment and transplantation. <i>Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. </i>2013 June; 43(6):1227-32. During the preservation period the organ can be perfused with hyperosmolar solutions to draw tissue water back into the vascular space and thereby restore a healthier fluid balance, and normal lung compliance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some cases, preservation solutions may also be administered to the lung via the devices described herein to reduce the risk of graft failure. In some examples, the preservation fluid may include low-potassium extracellular-type solutions such as Perfadex&#xae; or a composition as shown in Table 1. Amino acids, antibiotics, or agents (e.g., those shown in Table 2) may also be added to the preservation solution.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Perfusate Composition</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="203pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Krebs-Henseleit Buffer (118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 4.2 mM NaHCO3)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>0.2%-5% D-Glucose</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1-15% human Albumin (optional)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1-20% Hetastarch (optional)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1-10% Dextan 40</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Varying concentrations of Glutamine, Antibiotics, and amino acids</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0091" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Perfusate Composition</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="203pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>ROS scavenger (Glutathione/N-acetylcysteine)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2<sup>nd </sup>messenger (dibutryl cAMP (cAMP analogue))</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Glucose metabolism (Insulin)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Membrane stabilizer (Hydrocortisone)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Growth factors (VEGF, FGF)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Oxygen carrier (red blood cells, perfluorocarbon, hemoglobin</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>binding oxygen carrier)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">In some cases, donor lungs may exhibit evidence of damage resulting from a varieties of factors, e.g., quality of the donor lung, the type of preservation solution, length of time between harvest and culture, and so forth. In order to reduce and/or eliminate the degree of damage the donor lungs and/or portions thereof can be mounted, e.g., on devices described herein, and ventilated liquid and/or dry ventilation. In an example, air is perfused over the tracheal line, while the ventricular and/or arterial lines are perfused with a solution that mimics physiologic parameters, e.g., physiologic saline solution, blood containing solution, and/or a preservation solution. The donor lungs may remain mounted until the donor lungs are needed for transplant and/or until the damaged donor lungs exhibit re-epithelialization and exhibit improved endothelial barrier function. These perfusion methods can be combined with the cellular seeding methods, as described below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">Cell Seeding</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In some of the methods described herein, a lung tissue matrix, e.g., decellularized lung tissue matrix or artificial lung matrix, is seeded with cells, e.g., differentiated or regenerative cells.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">Any appropriate regenerative cell type, such as na&#xef;ve or undifferentiated cell types, can be used to seed the lung tissue matrix. The cells may be seeded at a variety of stages including, but not limited to, stem cell stage (e.g., after induction), progenitor cell stage, hemangioblast stage, or differentiated stage (e.g., CD 31+, vWF+). As used herein, regenerative cells can include, without limitation, progenitor cells, precursor cells, and &#x201c;adult&#x201d;-derived stem cells including umbilical cord cells (e.g., human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and fetal stem cells. Regenerative cells also can include differentiated or committed cell types. Stem cells appropriate for the methods and materials provided herein can include human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (e.g., undifferentiated, differentiated endoderm, anteriolized endoderm, TTF-1 positive lung progenitors), human mesenchymal stem cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC), iPS derived mesenchymal cells, or embryonic stem cells. In some cases, regenerative cells derived from other tissues also can be used. For example, regenerative cells derived from skin, bone, muscle, bone marrow, synovium, or adipose tissue can be used to develop stem cell-seeded tissue matrices.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">In some cases, a lung tissue matrix provided herein can be alternatively or further seeded with differentiated cell types such as (preferably human) epithelial cells and endothelial cells. For example, a lung matrix can be seeded with endothelial cells via the vasculature (e.g. through the arterial line or the venous line), and seeded with epithelial cells via the airway (e.g., through the tracheal line). The lung matrix can also be seeded with one or more cell types (e.g., one or more of types of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, adult peripheral blood derived epithelial cells, cord blood-derived epithelial cells, iPS derived epithelial cells, progenitor stage cells (e.g., smooth muscle), adult lung derived cell mixture (e.g., rat human), commercially available small airway epithelial cells or alveolar epithelial cells, Embryonic Stem (ES) cell-derived epithelial cells, and/or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">Any type of appropriate commercially available media and/or media kits may be used for the seeding and culture of cells. For example, SAGM media may be used for small airway cells (e.g., SAGM BulletKit by Lonza) and EGM-2 kits may be used for endothelial cells (e.g., EGM-2 BulletKit by Lonza). Media customized to the seeded endothelial cell type may be used (e.g., by increasing or decreasing growth factors such as VEGF) as described in, for example, Brudno Y et al. Enhancing microvascular formation and vessel maturation through temporal control over multiple pro-angiogenic and pro-maturation factors. <i>Biomaterials </i>34 (2013) 9201-9209. In the case of endothelial cells, a sequence of different media compositions may be used to induce different phases of seeding, expansion, engraftment, and maturation of cells. For example, in a first phase, a cell seeded constructs may be perfused with an &#x2018;angiogenic media&#x2019; for 2-30 days to increase endothelial cell expansion, migration, and metabolism. This media is characterized by high concentration of cytokines, e.g., VEGF at 5-100 ng/ml and bFGF at 5-100 ng/ml, and the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), e.g., 5-100 ng/ml PMA, which activates the angiogenic pathway through activation of protein kinase C, and Ang-1, which stimulates endothelial cell sprouting. In a second phase, a cell seeded construct can then be perfused with &#x2018;tightening media&#x2019; that supports endothelial maturation and the formation of tight junctions. Tightening media has lower levels of cytokines, with the same basic composition as the angiogenic media but with decreased levels of VEGF, bFGF and PMA (0.1-5 ng/ml VEGF, FGF, and PMA). Hydrocortisone, which promotes tight junction formation and has been shown to reduce pulmonary edema, can be further added to the tightening media to promote vascular maturation. Further promaturation factors such as PDGF and Ang-2 may be added to the tightening media to enhance vessel formation. Concentrations of these factors may be titrated to support different vessel sizes. Media changes can be performed gradually to avoid detrimental effects of sudden cytokine changes. Similar to endothelial cell supporting media, sequential media changes can be used to guide epithelial cell fate. Initial media may contain, for example, Activin A at 10-200 ng/ml and Pi3K inhibitors such as ZSTK 474 at 0.01-1 uM to induce definite endoderm, subsequently TGF-beta inhibitors such as A-8301 at 01-10 uM and BMP4 antagonists such as DMH-1 at 0.05-1 uM to induce anteriorized endoderm, and finally BMP4 at 1-100 ug/ml, FGF2 at 10-500 ng/ml, GSK-3beta inhibitor such as CHIR 99021 at 10-500 nM, a PI3K inhibitor such as PIK-75 at 1-100 nM and methotrexate at 1-100 nM to induce the generation of lung progenitor cells.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">Any appropriate method for isolating and collecting cells for seeding can be used. For example, induced pluripotent stem cells generally can be obtained from somatic cells &#x201c;reprogrammed&#x201d; to a pluripotent state by the ectopic expression of transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-MYC, Nanog, and Lin28. See Takahashi et al., <i>Cell </i>131:861-72 (2007); Park et al., <i>Nature </i>451:141-146 (2008); Yu et al., <i>Science </i>318:1917-20 (2007); Zhu et al., <i>Cell Stem Cell. </i>7:651-5 2010; and Li et al., <i>Cell Res. </i>21:196-204 (2011); Malik and Rao, Methods Mol Biol. 2013; 997:23-33; Okano et al., Circ Res. 2013 Feb. 1; 112(3):523-33; Lin and Ying, Methods Mol Biol. 2013; 936:295-312. Peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells can be isolated from patient blood samples and used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells. In other examples, induced pluripotent stem cells can be obtained by reprograming with constructs optimized for high co-expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-MYC in conjunction with small molecule such as transforming growth factor &#x3b2; (SB431542), MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and Rho-kinase signaling (Thiazovivin). See GroB et al., <i>Curr Mol Med. </i>13:765-76 (2013) and Hou et al., <i>Science </i>341:651:654 (2013). Methods for generating endothelial cells from stem cells are reviewed in Reed et al., Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2013 April; 75(4):897-906. Cord blood stem cells can be isolated from fresh or frozen umbilical cord blood. Mesenchymal stem cells can be isolated from, for example, raw unpurified bone marrow or ficoll-purified bone marrow. Epithelial and endothelial cells can be isolated and collected from living or cadaveric donors, e.g., from the subject who will be receiving the bioartificial lung, according to methods known in the art. For example, epithelial cells can be obtained from a skin tissue sample (e.g., a punch biopsy), and endothelial cells can be obtained from a vascular tissue sample. In some embodiments, proteolytic enzymes are perfused into the tissue sample through a catheter placed in the vasculature. Portions of the enzymatically treated tissue can be subjected to further enzymatic and mechanical disruption. The mixture of cells obtained in this manner can be separated to purify epithelial and endothelial cells. In some cases, flow cytometry-based methods (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting) can be used to sort cells based on the presence or absence of specific cell surface markers. Furthermore, lung cells (epithelial, mesenchymal, and endothelial) can be obtained from lung biopsies, which can be obtained via transbronchial and endobronchial biopsies or via surgical biopsies of lung tissue. In cases where non-autologous cells are used, the selection of immune type-matched cells should be considered, so that the organ or tissue will not be rejected when implanted into a subject.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">Isolated cells can be rinsed in a buffered solution (e.g., phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4) and resuspended in a cell culture medium. Standard cell culture methods can be used to culture and expand the population of cells. Once obtained, the cells can be used to seed the tissue matrix, e.g., introduced into the matrix via the arterial or venous lines (endothelial cells) or through the airway (tracheal) line (epithelial cells). For example, a tissue matrix can be seeded with at least one cell type in vitro at any appropriate cell density. For example, cell densities for seeding a matrix can be at least 1&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells/gram matrix. Cell densities can range between about 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>to about 1&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>cells/gram matrix (e.g., at least 100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000, 100,000,000, 1,000,000,000, or 10,000,000,000 cells/gram matrix) can be used.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In some cases, a decellularized or artificial lung tissue matrix, as provided herein, can be seeded with the cell types and cell densities described above by perfusion seeding. For example, a flow perfusion system can be used to seed the decellularized lung tissue matrix via the vascular system preserved in the tissue matrix (e.g., through the arterial line). In some cases, automated flow perfusion systems can be used under the appropriate conditions. Such perfusion seeding methods can improve seeding efficiencies and provide more uniform distribution of cells throughout the composition. Quantitative biochemical and image analysis techniques can be used to assess the distribution of seeded cells following either static or perfusion seeding methods.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">In some cases, a tissue matrix can be impregnated with one or more growth factors to stimulate differentiation of the seeded regenerative cells. For example, a tissue matrix can be impregnated with growth factors appropriate for the methods and materials provided herein, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-&#x3b2; growth factors, bone morphogenetic proteins (e.g., BMP-1, BMP-4), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), e.g., FGF-10, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or growth differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5). See, e.g., Desai and Cardoso, <i>Respire. Res. </i>3:2 (2002). These growth factors can be encapsulated to control temporal release. Different parts of the scaffold can be enhanced with different growth factors to add spatial control of growth factor stimulation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">Seeded tissue matrices can be incubated for a period of time (e.g., from several hours to about 14 days or more) post-seeding to improve fixation and penetration of the cells in the tissue matrix. The seeded tissue matrix can be maintained under conditions in which at least some of the regenerative cells can multiply and/or differentiate within and on the acellular tissue matrix. Such conditions can include, without limitation, the appropriate temperature (35-38 degree centigrade) and/or pressure (e.g., atmospheric), electrical and/or mechanical activity (e.g., ventilation via positive or negative pressure with positive end expiratory pressure from 1-20 cmH2O, mean airway pressure from 5-50 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure from 5-65cmH2O), the appropriate amounts of fluid, e.g., O<sub>2 </sub>(1-100% FiO2) and/or CO<sub>2 </sub>(0-10% FiCO2), an appropriate amount of humidity (10-100%), and sterile or near-sterile conditions. Such conditions can also include wet ventilation, wet to dry ventilation and dry ventilation. In some cases, nutritional supplements (e.g., nutrients and/or a carbon source such as glucose), exogenous hormones, or growth factors can be added to the seeded tissue matrix. Histology and cell staining can be performed to assay for seeded cell propagation. Any appropriate method can be performed to assay for seeded cell differentiation. In general, the methods described herein will be performed in an airway organ bioreactor apparatus, e.g., as described herein.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">Thus, the methods described herein can be used to generate a transplantable bioartificial lung tissue, e.g., for transplanting into a human subject. As described herein, a transplantable tissue will preferably retain a sufficiently intact vasculature that can be connected to the patient's vascular system.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">The bioartificial lung tissues described herein can be combined with packaging material to generate articles of manufacture or kits. Components and methods for producing articles of manufacture are well known. In addition to the bioartificial tissues, an article of manufacture or kit can further can include, for example, one or more anti-adhesives, sterile water, pharmaceutical carriers, buffers, and/or other reagents for promoting the development of functional lung tissue in vitro and/or following transplantation. In addition, printed instructions describing how the composition contained therein can be used can be included in such articles of manufacture.

In some embodiments, the methods provided herein can be used to restore some lung function in patients having diseases that impair or reduce lung capacity (e.g., cystic fibrosis, COPD, emphysema, lung cancer, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, lung trauma, or other genetic or congenital lung abnormalities, e.g., bronchogenic cyst, pulmonary agenesis and hypoplasia, polyalveolar lobe, alveolocapillary dysplasia, sequestration including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and scimitar syndrome, pulmonary lymphangiectasis, congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), and cystic adenomatoid malformation (CAM) and other lung cysts). The methods provided herein also include those wherein the subject is identified as in need of a particular stated treatment, e.g., increased lung function, or increased or improved lung capacity.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Bioartificial lung tissues (e.g., whole organs or portions thereof) can be generated according to the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, the methods comprise transplanting a bioartificial lung tissue as provided herein to a subject (e.g., a human patient) in need thereof. In some embodiments, a bioartificial lung tissue is transplanted to the site of diseased or damaged tissue. For example, bioartificial lung tissues can be transplanted into the chest cavity of a subject in place of (or in conjunction with) a non-functioning or poorly-functioning lung; methods for performing lung transplantation are known in the art, see, e.g., Boasquevisque et al., Surgical Techniques: Lung Transplant and Lung Volume Reduction, <i>Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society </i>6:66-78 (2009); Camargo et al., Surgical maneuvers for the management of bronchial complications in lung transplantation, <i>Eur J Cardiothorac Surg </i>2008; 34:1206-1209 (2008); Yoshida et al., &#x201c;Surgical Technique of Experimental Lung Transplantation in Rabbits,&#x201d; <i>Ann Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. </i>11(1):7-11 (2005); Venuta et al., Evolving Techniques and Perspectives in Lung Transplantation, Transplantation Proceedings 37(6):2682-2683 (2005); Yang and Conte, <i>Transplantation Proceedings </i>32(7):1521-1522 (2000); Gaissert and Patterson, Surgical Techniques of Single and Bilateral Lung Transplantation in The Transplantation and Replacement of Thoracic Organs, 2d ed. Springer Netherlands (1996).</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">The methods can include transplanting a bioartificial lung or portion thereof as provided herein during a surgical procedure to partially or completely remove a subject's lung and/or during a lung resection. The methods can also include harvesting a lung or a portion thereof from a live donor or cadaver and preserving or regenerating the lung in a bioreactor described herein. In some cases, the methods provided herein can be used to replace or supplement lung tissue and function in a subject, e.g., a human or animal subject.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Any appropriate method(s) can be performed to assay for lung function before or after transplantation. For example, methods can be performed to assess tissue healing, to assess functionality, and to assess cellular in-growth. In some cases, tissue portions can be collected and treated with a fixative such as, for example, neutral buffered formalin. Such tissue portions can be dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned with a microtome for histological analysis. Sections can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E) and then mounted on glass slides for microscopic evaluation of morphology and cellularity. For example, histology and cell staining can be performed to detect seeded cell propagation. Assays can include functional evaluation of the transplanted tissue matrix or imaging techniques (e.g., computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., contrast-enhanced MRI)). Assays can further include functional tests under rest and physiologic stress (e.g., body plethysmography, lung function testing). Functionality of the matrix seeded with cells can be assayed using methods known in the art, e.g., histology, electron microscopy, and mechanical testing (e.g., of volume and compliance). Gas exchange can be measured as another functionality assay. To assay for cell proliferation, thymidine kinase activity can be measured by, for example, detecting thymidine incorporation. In some cases, blood tests can be performed to evaluate the function of the lungs based on levels of oxygen in the blood.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">To facilitate functionality assays during culture, any line of the bioreactor apparatus' described herein may include sampling ports to allow for single or real-time measurements of functionality parameters (e.g., pH, glucose, lactate, Na, K, Ca, Cl, bicarb, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, sat). Metabolites may also be used to monitor cell number and viability using colorimetric assays, and biochemical assays may be used to monitor cell maturation (e.g., measuring surfactant protein, etc.) For example, an increased concentration of surfactant can indicate that the culture lung possesses sufficient epithelial cells to withstand dry ventilation. In some cases, endothelial barrier function may be used as a marker of vascular maturity. Lungs can be perfused with different sizes of molecules (such as dextrans of defined sizes and albumin), and microbeads (increasing sizes from 0.2 to 5 um), as well as isolated red blood cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can then be sampled to assess leakage of these markers into the alveolar space. For example, 500-kDa dextran can be used in combination with a Bronchoalvelar lavage assay to determine the percentage of dextran retained within the vascular compartment. An increase in the percentage of dextran retained indicates an improvement in the barrier function because barrier function to dextran is dependent on viable and functional endothelium, while dextran will diffuse across a denuded vascular basement membrane (e.g., in an acellular lung) over time during constant perfusion. For example, a cadaveric lung may retain substantially all of the dextran within the vascular compartment while acellular lungs may retain a small percentage of the dextran (e.g., 10.0%&#xb1;8.0%). Leakage of these markers into the alveolar space greater than a tolerated minimum (for example &#x3e;10% of 4 um microbeads, or greater than 20% of 0.2 um microbeads) can be used to indicate that the lung is not sufficiently mature to withstand dry ventilation.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">In some cases, molecular biology techniques such as RT-PCR can be used to quantify the expression of metabolic (e.g. surfactant protein, mucin-1) and differentiation markers (e.g. TTF-1, p63, surfactant protein C). Any appropriate RT-PCR protocol can be used. Briefly, total RNA can be collected by homogenizing a biological sample (e.g., tendon sample), performing a chloroform extraction, and extracting total RNA using a spin column (e.g., RNeasy&#xae; Mini spin column (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif.)) or other nucleic acid-binding substrate. In other cases, markers associated with lung cells types and different stages of differentiation for such cell types can be detected using antibodies and standard immunoassays.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">Airway Organ Bioreactor Apparatus</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">An exemplary airway organ bioreactor is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Lung chamber <b>101</b> holds a lung (not shown). The pulmonary artery of lung is connected to the pulmonary arterial line <b>105</b>, the pulmonary vein of the lung is connected to venous line <b>106</b>, and the trachea of the lung is connected to the tracheal line <b>107</b>. The bioreactor <b>100</b> is a neutral pressure ventilation system because sterile filter <b>108</b> equilibrates pressure in the lung chamber <b>101</b> with the pressure of incubator chamber <b>102</b>, while the tracheal line <b>107</b> is also equilibrated with the pressure of the incubator because tracheal valve <b>122</b> is generally open.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">Within lung chamber <b>101</b>, the cell matrix is perfused antegradely with a cells and media in order to allow seeding of cells to grow in the lung matrix. The perfusion takes place through the arterial line <b>105</b> to the pulmonary artery and through the venous line to the pulmonary vein while the tracheal valve <b>122</b> remains open. This configuration permits the cells and media to reach the capillary bed from both the arterial and venous sides and permits the media to diffuse through the acellular basement membrane and exit the matrix via the trachea or across the pleura.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The arterial flow sensor <b>114</b> and the venous flow sensor <b>120</b> are sensors capable of measuring the flow rate of these lines (e.g., transonic flow probes). Flow rate sensors may be incorporated into any fluid line within any of the bioreactors described herein (e.g., any ingress or egress line, arterial line, venous line, tracheal line, or oxygen exchange line). In certain embodiments, the flow rate may also be calculated based on the diameter of the tubing and the speed of the associated pumps.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">The cells and/or media flow through the arterial line <b>104</b> and the venous line <b>107</b> through the pulmonary vasculature.

The oxygenated media then flows to the arterial perfusion pump <b>103</b> or venous perfusion pump <b>116</b> that circulate the media through the bioreactor <b>100</b>. This pump is controlled by the control module <b>110</b> that controls the speed of the perfusion pump <b>104</b> and the venous pump <b>116</b> speed based on the pressure readings from the arterial pressure sensor <b>104</b> and the venous pressure sensor <b>118</b> respectively. Arterial and venous perfusion pressures can be modified based on the size and number of cells in order to optimize cell delivery. The control module <b>110</b> is also capable of recording data (e.g., resistance readings from arterial pressure sensor <b>104</b>, and venous pressure sensor <b>118</b>. The media completes the circuit, returning to the arterial line <b>104</b> and/or to the venous line <b>106</b>. During initial anterograde seeding, media diffuses through the lung matrix before it or as it reaches the capillary bed. To guide media through the scaffold, the tracheal valve <b>122</b> can be opened or closed to modify the pressure within the lung thereby guiding the media through the scaffold. In some cases, retrograde seeding can be used. In these cases, the cells and/or media flow through the venous line <b>107</b>, and the oxygenated media flows to the venous perfusion pump <b>116</b>, which circulates the media through the bioreactor <b>100</b>. As with anterograde seeding, to guide media through the scaffold, the tracheal valve <b>122</b> can be opened or closed to modify the pressure within the lung thereby guiding the media through the scaffold.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">After the vasculature resistance of the lung, matrix is sufficient to withstand physiological conditions (e.g., vascular resistance increases due to the reendothelialization of the lung matrix), the bioreactor <b>100</b> switches to anterograde perfusion. The vasculature resistance is measured by the arterial pressure sensor <b>104</b> over time. As the vascular system is populated, the diffusion across the vascular membrane decreases causing an increase in the pressure measured by the arterial sensor <b>104</b> (i.e., an increase in vascular resistance). In some examples, particles are perfused through the bioreactor <b>100</b> and their progress is monitored to determine the diffusion rate across the vascular membrane.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, components of the bioreactor <b>200</b> include a lung chamber <b>201</b>, an incubator chamber <b>202</b>, a media reservoir <b>203</b>, an arterial perfusion pump <b>204</b>, a drainage pump <b>205</b>, an arterial pressure sensor <b>206</b>, a chamber pressure sensor <b>207</b>, a tracheal pressure sensor <b>208</b>, a venous pressure sensor <b>209</b>, an arterial line <b>210</b>, a venous line <b>211</b>, a tracheal line <b>212</b>, a filter <b>213</b>, an oxygenator <b>214</b>, a control module <b>215</b>, and a venous valve <b>216</b>, a tracheal valve <b>212</b>, and an egress line <b>217</b>.

A lung matrix is placed in lung chamber <b>202</b>. The flow perfusion system uses the arterial line <b>210</b> connected to the pulmonary artery of the lung. The media is aspirated from the media reservoir <b>203</b> and passes through the oxygenator <b>214</b>. The oxygenator <b>214</b> exchanges air, e.g., from an entrance point <b>218</b> and an exit point <b>219</b>, with the environment surrounding the incubator chamber <b>202</b>. After passing through the oxygenator <b>214</b>, arterial pressure sensor <b>206</b> records the arterial pressure and transmits this data to the control module <b>215</b>. The arterial pressure reading then regulates the roller pump that pumps media from the reservoir to the pulmonary artery. The media then circulates out of the lung chamber <b>201</b> through an egress line <b>217</b> and is pumped using the drainage pump <b>205</b> into the media reservoir <b>203</b>. The drainage pump <b>205</b> is bi-directional and can be used to circulate media between the media reservoir <b>203</b> to the lung chamber <b>201</b>. This recirculation also helps to maintain the correct pH in the lung chamber <b>201</b>. Control module <b>215</b> controls the drainage pump <b>205</b>, e.g., speed and/or direction, based on pressure readings recorded by the chamber pressure sensor <b>207</b>. As the chamber pressure in lung chamber <b>201</b> fluctuates, liquid flows in and out of the tracheal line <b>212</b>. Because the venous line <b>211</b> is open to the media reservoir <b>203</b>, the venous pressure equilibrates to the chamber pressure thus preventing a transpulmonary pressure gradient that can cause fluid to flow from the artery into the tissue. By monitoring the chamber pressure and pumping accordingly, the media level in the lung chamber <b>201</b> can be maintained.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">During negative pressure wet ventilation, fluid enters and exits the lung matrix causing the pressure in the lung chamber <b>201</b> to fluctuate. This fluctuation also expands and contracts the lung matrix. This expansion causes repetitive liquid movement in and out of the trachea and fluid shifts through the lung matrix (e.g., through the pulmonary vein and lymphatic vessels) into the lung chamber <b>201</b>. These fluid shifts can vary throughout the culture period and can result in unstable culture conditions, an undesired increase in chamber pressure, media overflow, the failure of negative pressure ventilation, and the damage of the lung or lung graft. Monitoring the lung chamber <b>201</b> pressure using the chamber pressure sensor <b>207</b> allows the control module <b>215</b> to correct for these fluid shifts by appropriately adjusting the direction and duration of the drainage pump <b>205</b>. For example, as the media volume in the lung chamber <b>201</b> increases, an increase in pressure is sensed by the chamber pressure sensor <b>207</b>. This data is transmitted to the control module <b>215</b>, which activates the perfusion pump <b>205</b> for a sufficient duration to return excess media from the lung chamber <b>201</b> to the media reservoir <b>203</b> until desired pressure is restored.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bioreactor <b>200</b> also includes the tracheal pressure sensor <b>208</b> and the venous pressure sensor <b>209</b>. The tracheal pressure sensor <b>208</b> measures pressure within the airway (e.g., the trachea). The tracheal line <b>212</b> is connected to the media reservoir <b>203</b> by the tracheal valve <b>221</b> and the pressure within the tracheal line <b>212</b> equilibrates with the pressure within the media reservoir <b>203</b>. To limit the airway pressure to a physiologic range, the height of the media reservoir <b>203</b> may be raised to modify the generated positive airway pressure. As the chamber pressure decreases, the tracheal pressure will also, to a lesser extent, decrease.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">The bioreactor <b>200</b> can also use the venous pressure sensor <b>209</b> to actively monitor the media exchange rate between the venous line <b>212</b> and the media reservoir <b>203</b>. The venous after load into the system is controlled by the level of the reservoir when valve <b>216</b> is closed, or by a resistance valve that can be attached to venous valve <b>216</b> if it is open position. For example, the venous valve <b>216</b> is generally in an open position. A low-pressure reading (e.g., &#x3c;&#x2212;5 mmHg) may trigger the venous valve <b>216</b> to close (e.g., automatically or by an operator) thus providing more venous backpressure to prevent post-capillary vascular collapse. If the pressure reading is high (e.g. &#x3e;20 mm Hg, the venous valve <b>216</b> can open to reduce the venous afterload and minimize fluid shifts into the interstitial space and airways.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the pressure in the media chamber <b>203</b> is equilibrated with the ambient environment (e.g., the incubator chamber) through the sterile filter <b>213</b>. This exchange also permits the exchange of gasses (e.g., carbon dioxide) between the incubator chamber <b>202</b> and the media reservoir <b>203</b>, which helps maintain the appropriate pH values of the media in the system. The height of the media reservoir <b>203</b> may be adjusted relative to the height of the lung chamber <b>201</b>. This causes a positive wet respiratory pressure and affects the tracheal airway pressure in relation to the lung. For example, the media reservoir <b>203</b> is set at 4 cm above the lung submerged in the media. This causes a positive airway pressure.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">Generally, the pressure recorded by any of the sensors described herein is within physiological ranges depending on the organ cultured.

The tracheal line <b>304</b> is connected to the airway of the lung (not shown). The compressor <b>303</b> provides positive pressure to the pressure reservoir <b>303</b>, and the pressure level in the pressure reservoir <b>302</b> can be modified by the pressure release valve <b>301</b>, (e.g., pressure can be reduced). In certain embodiments, positive pressure manifold <b>300</b> is a computerized system that actively regulates pressure in the pressure reservoir <b>302</b> in response to the inspiratory and expiratory related pressure variations in the airway (e.g., as recorded by the tracheal pressure sensor <b>408</b> or by the manifold pressure sensor <b>308</b>).

The tracheal line <b>304</b> is also connected to the inspiratory valve <b>322</b> and the expiratory valve <b>324</b>. The inspiratory valve <b>322</b> and the expiratory valve are one-way valves that allow fluid, e.g., air, to flow in one direction and that prevent backflow. During the expiratory phase, air flows from the tracheal line through the expiratory valve <b>332</b> and the expiratory pressure valve <b>324</b> to an exhaust line (not shown). Expired fluid does not enter the pressure reservoir <b>301</b> due to the inspiratory valve <b>322</b>. During the inspiratory phase, air flows from the pressure reservoir through the inspiratory valve <b>322</b> to the airway of the lung via the tracheal line <b>304</b>. The expiratory pressure release valve <b>324</b> ensures that the expiratory line retains a positive pressure during an inhalation phase, thus preventing air from flowing through the expiratory line during an inhalation phase.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, components of bioreactor <b>400</b> include a lung chamber <b>401</b>, an incubator chamber <b>402</b>, a media reservoir <b>403</b>, an arterial perfusion pump <b>404</b>, a drainage pump <b>405</b>, an arterial pressure sensor <b>406</b>, a chamber pressure sensor <b>407</b>, a tracheal pressure sensor <b>408</b>, a venous pressure sensor <b>409</b>, an arterial line <b>410</b>, a venous line <b>411</b>, a tracheal line <b>412</b>, a sterile filter <b>413</b>, an oxygenator <b>414</b>, a control module <b>415</b>, a venous valve <b>416</b>, and the positive pressure manifold <b>300</b>.

The pressure in lung chamber <b>401</b> is variable to inflate or deflate the lung matrix.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">During the inspiration phase, the pressure within the lung chamber <b>401</b> drops below the airway pressure, thereby creating negative airway pressure. This negative pressure causes fluid shifts from the vasculature into the tissue, leading to interstitial edema, and increased secretions in the airway. These fluid shifts are exacerbated by the resistance of the tracheal line <b>412</b> and attached tubing. During expiration phase, the pressure within the lung chamber <b>401</b> increases, thereby creating positive airway pressure. If the trachea is open to atmospheric pressure, or connected to a neutral pressure, proximal airways will be compressed by the chamber pressure and collapse leading to air trapping in distal airways and alveoli and damage to the lung matrix. The positive pressure manifold <b>300</b>, as discussed above, minimizes pressure fluctuation during inspiration and expiration by having an appropriate size, e.g., approximately 10&#xd7;the tidal volume of the lung.

Lung expansion and the perialveolar interstitial pressure gradient. <i>J Appl Physiol </i>1989; 66: 2600-5. Correspondingly, increased spontaneous ventilation leads to increased lymphatic flow as discussed in, for example, Albelda S M et al., Effects of increased ventilation on lung lymph flow in unanesthetized sheep. <i>J Appl Physiol </i>(1985). 1986 June; 60(6):2063-70.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0138">In a standard ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) setup used for lung evaluation, values are set to p<sub>t</sub>&#x2248;7.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, p<sub>p </sub>is 0 mmHg, pa 13 mmHg, p<sub>v</sub>&#x2248;6 mmHg (mean p<sub>v </sub>9.5 mmHg). Applying the equation, as discussed above, under ideal circumstances (assuming physiologic oncotic pressure of perfusate and osmotic reflection coefficient) a net fluid flow into the interstitial space is approximately 10-20 cc per minute. In this setting, the lung is isolated and thus lacks the physiologic counter-pressure normally applied by the chest wall, the fluctuations of interpleural pressure and interstitial pressure, and the resulting bidirectional transpulmonary gradient. Over time, this leads to the formation of hydrostatic interstitial pulmonary edema and ultimately alveolar edema with organ failure. This has been described as circuit induced lung injury in, for example, Erasmus M E et al., Normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion of non-heart-beating donor lungs in pigs: from pretransplant function analysis towards a 6-h machine preservation. <i>Transpl Int </i>2006; 19: 589-593.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0139">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the pressure equilibration line <b>918</b> between the lung chamber <b>901</b> and the media reservoir <b>903</b> and the occluder <b>917</b> on the filter <b>913</b> equalize pressures between the lung chamber <b>901</b> and the media reservoir <b>903</b>. This ensures equal pressure across both chambers during all phases of the respiratory cycle. This modification can be applied to all bioreactors discussed herein, both small animal and large animal/human, and can be used in both positive and negative pressure ventilation modes and wet and dry ventilation modes. The introduction of this pressure equilibration, line <b>918</b> enables the creation of a bi-directional transpulmonary gradient. In other words, the lung can be compressed from the inside via the Ppm <b>300</b> (thereby creating positive airway pressure), and from the outside via the PPC Module <b>700</b> (thereby creating positive chamber pressure).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0140">The purpose of this bidirectional transpulmonary gradient is to prevent the formation of interstitial edema over long-term isolated lung culture and to treat edema that has already formed (e.g., in previously injured lungs) by pushing the interstitial fluid into the vasculature thus improving lung function (e.g., compliance, diffusion, weight, and size). This gradient can be achieved if the venous pressure can be adjusted relative to the chamber pressure. By adjusting the height of the media reservoir <b>903</b>, and thereby adjusting the height of the water column in the venous cannula and draining pulmonary venous return to media chamber <b>903</b>, venous pressure <b>904</b> can be kept at a constant level higher or lower than the chamber pressure. Essentially, the equilibration between the two chambers allows constant pulmonary venous drainage during negative pressure ventilation. In contrast, if equilibration is not maintained and P<sub>v </sub>is kept constant, a negative pressure in a lung chamber <b>901</b> would result in decreased venous drainage or reversal (e.g., partial or complete) in venous flow, while a positive pressure in a lung chamber <b>901</b> would collapse pulmonary veins leading to outflow obstruction.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0141">The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1&#x2014;Lung Regeneration Based on Acellular Lung Scaffolds and Human Derived Lung Progenitor Cells</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Background</heading><p id="p-0147" num="0142">Lung grafts have been generated using fetal epithelial cells as discussed, for example, Ott H C et al., Regeneration and orthotopic transplantation of a bioartificial lung. <i>Nat Med. </i>2010 August; 16(8):927-33 and Song J J et al., Enhanced in vivo function of bioartificial lungs in rats. <i>Ann Thorac Surg. </i>2011 September; 92(3):998-1005.

Organs were prepared for culture and mounted within the organ chamber using the procedure described above with the exception that non-colloid culture media was used. Culture was maintained for at least 72 hours during which the perfusate was periodically sampled at the PA and PV. Culture media was also changed at the same intervals described for short-term ILC an additional media was added if the organ chamber reservoir appeared low (&#x3c;1 L). Perfusion and ventilation pressures were continuously monitored throughout culture. Functional testing for oxygen exchange was carried out by ventilating with 100% O<sub>2 </sub>(FiO<sub>2</sub>=1.0) for 10 minutes and observing the change in partial pressure of O<sub>2 </sub>in the perfusate as measured at the PV outlet, where &#x394;PV pO<sub>2</sub>=PV pO<sub>2 </sub>post-test&#x2212;PV pO<sub>2 </sub>pre-test. This method of functional testing was chosen over comparing pO<sub>2 </sub>at the PA vs. PV because the system perfuses media in a closed loop and does not deoxygenate the perfusate upstream of the PA. A comparison of PV pO<sub>2 </sub>values at FiO<sub>2</sub>=0.21 and 1.0 reveals the ability of the ventilating lung to oxygenate the perfusate in the context of our bioreactor system. The hollow fiber gas exchanger fed with incubator air remained in the perfusion during functional testing.

Adjustments were made about as frequent as media sampling, between 3-7 times per 24-hour period.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00008" num="00008"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Table of Culture Parameter Adjustments</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="126pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Observation</entry><entry>Adjustment</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>PPA too high or too low</entry><entry>Decrease or increase PA flow rate</entry></row><row><entry>Perfusate not draining</entry><entry>Adjust PV cannula</entry></row><row><entry>from PV cannula</entry></row><row><entry>Significant atelectasis</entry><entry>Increase I:E or breath size (distance</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>between POC-Upper and POC-Lower)</entry></row><row><entry>Little visible motion during</entry><entry>Increase breath size or make breaths</entry></row><row><entry>ventilation</entry><entry>longer (reduce RR)</entry></row><row><entry>Lung deflates before POC-</entry><entry>Decrease POC-Upper or increase I:E</entry></row><row><entry>Upper is reached</entry></row><row><entry>Over-inflation</entry><entry>Decrease breath size, decrease I:E,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>make breaths shorter (increase RR), or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>increase POC-Lower (bring closer to 0)</entry></row><row><entry>Under-inflation</entry><entry>Increase breath size, increase I:E,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>make breaths longer (decrease RR), or</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>decrease POC-Lower</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0211" num="0200">Methods</p><p id="p-0212" num="0201">In coordination with the New England Organ Bank (NEOB), a donated human lung that was not found suitable for transplantation was procured from a heart-beating donor in standard surgical fashion. The pre-donation chest x-ray showed a small amount of basilar atelectasis and the arterial oxygen tension was 116 mmHg on 100% FiO2 indicating compromised gas exchange. The lung was delivered in a sterile container on ice and mounted on a bioreactor immediately after arrival. The right lung was isolated, and the PA, PVs, and trachea were cannulated before being set up as described above for long-term ILC of 72 hours.
