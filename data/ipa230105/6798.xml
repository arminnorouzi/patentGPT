The physical resource grid may comprise a set of resource elements to which various physical channels and physical signals are mapped. For example, the physical channels may include the physical downlink, uplink and sidelink shared channels (PDSCH, PUSCH, PSSCH) carrying user specific data, also referred to as downlink, uplink and sidelink payload data, the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) carrying for example a master information block (MIB) and a system information block (SIB), the physical downlink, uplink and sidelink control channels (PDCCH, PUCCH, PSSCH) carrying for example the downlink control information (DCI), the uplink control information (UCI) and the sidelink control information (SCI). For the uplink, the physical channels may further include the physical random access channel (PRACH or RACH) used by UEs for accessing the network once a UE synchronized and obtained the MIB and SIB. The physical signals may comprise reference signals or symbols (RS), synchronization signals and the like. The resource grid may comprise a frame or radio frame having a certain duration in the time domain and having a given bandwidth in the frequency domain. The frame may have a certain number of subframes of a predefined length, e.g. 1 ms. Each subframe may include one or more slots of 12 or 14 OFDM symbols depending on the cyclic prefix (CP) length. A frame may also consist of a smaller number of OFDM symbols, e.g. when utilizing shortened transmission time intervals (sTTI) or a mini-slot/non-slot-based frame structure comprising just a few OFDM symbols.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The wireless communication system may be any single-tone or multicarrier system using frequency-division multiplexing, like the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system, or any other IFFT-based signal with or without CP, e.g. DFT-s-OFDM. Other waveforms, like non-orthogonal waveforms for multiple access, e.g. filter-bank multicarrier (FBMC), generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) or universal filtered multi carrier (UFMC), may be used. The wireless communication system may operate, e.g., in accordance with the LTE-Advanced pro standard or the 5G or NR, New Radio, standard.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wireless network or communication system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may by a heterogeneous network having distinct overlaid networks, e.g., a network of macro cells with each macro cell including a macro base station, like base station gNB<sub>1 </sub>to gNB<sub>5</sub>, and a network of small cell base stations (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), like femto or pico base stations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition to the above described terrestrial wireless network also non-terrestrial wireless communication networks exist including spaceborne transceivers, like satellites, and/or airborne transceivers, like unmanned aircraft systems. The non-terrestrial wireless communication network or system may operate in a similar way as the terrestrial system described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example in accordance with the LTE-Advanced Pro standard or the 5G or NR, new radio, standard.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In mobile communication networks, for example in a network like that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, like an LTE or 5G/NR network, there may be UEs that communicate directly with each other over one or more sidelink (SL) channels, e.g., using the PC5 interface. UEs that communicate directly with each other over the sidelink may include vehicles communicating directly with other vehicles (V2V communication), vehicles communicating with other entities of the wireless communication network (V2X communication), for example roadside entities, like traffic lights, traffic signs, or pedestrians. Other UEs may not be vehicular related UEs and may comprise any of the above-mentioned devices. Such devices may also communicate directly with each other (D2D communication) using the SL channels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When considering two UEs directly communicating with each other over the sidelink, both UEs may be served by the same base station so that the base station may provide sidelink resource allocation configuration or assistance for the UEs. For example, both UEs may be within the coverage area of a base station, like one of the base stations depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This is referred to as an &#x201c;in-coverage&#x201d; scenario. Another scenario is referred to as an &#x201c;out-of-coverage&#x201d; scenario. It is noted that &#x201c;out-of-coverage&#x201d; does not mean that the two UEs are not within one of the cells depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, rather, it means that these UEs<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">may not be connected to a base station, for example, they are not in an RRC connected state, so that the UEs do not receive from the base station any sidelink resource allocation configuration or assistance, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">may be connected to the base station, but, for one or more reasons, the base station may not provide sidelink resource allocation configuration or assistance for the UEs, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">may be connected to the base station that may not support NR V2X services, e.g. GSM, UMTS, LTE base stations.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">When considering two UEs directly communicating with each other over the sidelink, e.g. using the PC5 interface, one of the UEs may also be connected with a BS, and may relay information from the BS to the other UE via the sidelink interface. The relaying may be performed in the same frequency band (in-band-relay) or another frequency band (out-of-band relay) may be used. In the first case, communication on the Uu and on the sidelink may be decoupled using different time slots as in time division duplex, TDD, systems.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">It is noted that the information in the above section is only for enhancing the understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form conventional technology that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0015">According to an embodiment, a communication system may have: a data transmission controller;

In the rate-less HARQ approach, the transmitter, e.g. gNB, transmits constantly more redundancy for a data packet until it receives an ACK which indicates a successful reception at the receiver. This causes the transmitter to stop and proceed with other transmissions. However, in current 5G systems which assume a half-duplex gNB which operates in TDD or FDD schemes, these rate-less HARQ approaches come with a high UL control channel overhead. In particular, the gNB has to reserve many physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) resources distributed over the duration of the transmission since it does not know when to expect the ACK from the receiver. Furthermore, the gNB wants to reduce the latency till the next PUCCH opportunity to a minimum in order to reduce the overhead of unnecessary downlink transmissions. Sharing these resources with other UL transmissions for other UEs would degrade the reliability of PUCCH in case of an collision. Hence, this overhead poses a severe limitation on the practicality of rate-less HARQ schemes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">Full Duplex Transmission&#x2014;Communication System</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">According to embodiments, the communication system comprises a data transmission controller, at least a transmitter (like the transmitter of base station) and at least a receiver (like the receiver of a UE). The transmitter is configured to transmit a first data portion to the receiver by use of a resource portion comprising a bandwidth and a plurality of time frames in a manner to further increase a redundancy of the first data portion to be transmitted from time frame to time frame of the plurality of time frames, wherein the receiver is configured to analyze the received first data portion and its redundancy to determine a correctly and/or completely and/or sufficiently received first data portion or incorrectly and/or incompletely and/or insufficiently received first data portion and to transmit an ACK signal to the transmitter using said resource portion, when determining the correctly and/or completely and/or sufficiently received first data portion.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">Full Duplex Feedback Transmission&#x2014;gNB, eNB, Based Station or User Equipment</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">Another embodiment refers to a gNB, eNB, base station or user equipment forming a transmitter of the communication system.

Here, only a limited full duplex capability of the transmitter is used. Note, that this principle is not limited to HARQ process or rate-less HARQ processes. For example, this principle can be used for conventional HARQ process comprising signals like an ACK and a NACK. Furthermore, this process does not require other HARQ mechanisms, but enables to exchange control data so as to improve spectral efficiency, spectral energy, reliability and low intensity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0043">Full Duplex Feedback Transmission&#x2014;Further Aspects</p><p id="p-0042" num="0044">According to embodiments, the transmission controller is configured to stop the transmitting of the first data portion in response to the received ACK signal.

This approach enables to save energy. According to embodiments, the predetermined time frames are periodically arranged within the resource portion, wherein the periodicity is preconfigured or configured by a gNB. According to further embodiments, the predetermined time frames within the resource portion are explicitly indicated by a gNB, e.g. by using a bitmap or a periodicity and a starting offset.

Therefore, another embodiment refers to a computer readable digital storage medium having stored there on a computer program having a program code for performing one of the above-discussed methods.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">Embodiments of this aspect enable to grant/schedule resources for a transmitter and/or a receiver within a resource portion, which is at the moment not free, e.g., used by another transmitter/receiver or used by itself. Thus, the transmitter as well as the receiver can prepare for the transmission/receipt and starts the transmission/receipt when receiving a starting trigger (also referred to as event). This is beneficial, since by such an approach scheduling dynamic resources is more easy. For example, when using the concept of full duplex feedback transmission, other transmitter/receiver/pair or another transmission can start immediately after the previous transmission. Of course, this concept is also applicable to other transmissions concepts, e.g., when the transmission rate varies, so that it is unknown when the previous transmission will be completed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">Dynamic Starting Point&#x2014;Further Aspects</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">According to embodiments the event may comprise a signal provided by the resource controller. According to further embodiments, the event can comprise an ACK signal indicating the receipt of the first data portion. Here, the ACK signal may be transmitted using said first resource portions. Using the ACK as event is beneficial since said ACK is available when using full duplex feedback transmission. The transmitter and/or the receiver may&#x2014;according to embodiments&#x2014;start listening beginning with the earliest starting point, e.g. in order to determine the ACK signal or (in general) the event. Note, the listening may be performed for a previously configured duration.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">According to further embodiments, the event may comprise a signal power being below a predetermined threshold and/or being below a predetermined threshold for a predetermined time period.

The resource portion is marked by <b>10</b><i>r </i>and comprises a plurality of sub portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>2</b> and <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b>. These portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> may all use the complete frequency band belonging to the resource portion <b>10</b><i>r</i>. in the portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> may be sequentially arranged in the time domain. Advantageously, but not necessarily, the portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> may be arranged without a gap in between when seen in a time domain. However, it should be noted that the shape with regard to the frequency domain and the time domain may differ, e.g., that the bandwidth of the frequency portion varies on the used frequencies vary over the time or that not a continuous time portion is used.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">According to embodiments, at the end of each time frame <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> a so-called control frame <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> may be arranged. This control frame <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> may be arranged at the end, i.e., as part of the portion <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> or between the portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">These control portions <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>2</b> and <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>3</b> have a position, but are not used as control portions. This is illustrated by the schematic. Consequently, the entire resource portion <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>2</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> and <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>4</b> including the portions <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>2</b> and <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>3</b> can be used for the downlink, i.e., the transition of the payload.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">According to this aspect, the transmitter transmits the first data portion to the receiver by use of the resource portion comprising the elements <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>2</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>3</b> and <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>4</b>. During this transmission, especially along the time domain, the redundancy of the first data portion to be transmitted is increased from frame to frame (i.e., from <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>2</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> to <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>4</b>). This so-called rate-less HARQ mechanism is performed up to the point of time, when a stop command is received. Here, the stop command or, in general control commands are transmitted within the same resource portion. For example, the receiver of the data portion transmits an ACK signal using the portion <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> so as to indicate a successful receipt of the data portion. In order to find out, whether the entire data portion has been received correctly, it continuously decodes the sub portions <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>2</b>, <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>3</b> and <b>10</b><i>r</i><b>4</b> and sends the ACK signal after determining, a successfully/completely/sufficiently receipt. For example, when a receiver receives the portion completely to a previous point of time it can send the ACK signal or the time frame marked by <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> within the same resource portion. According to embodiments, the control portions <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>, <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>2</b> to <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>3</b> can be used. The usage of predetermined positions is advantageous, since this improves the detection of the ACK signal within the same resource portion, especially for the transmitter.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, the receiver, here a UE transmits the ACK in a PUCCH <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> using only its own downlink resource (fully or partially). This does not disturb any other UE since the HARQ transmission only interferes with the UEs own downlink transmission which is anyway decoded correctly or predicted to be decoded correctly at the time of the PUCCH transmission <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">As indicated above, only a part of the entire downlink resources <b>10</b><i>r </i>are used for transmitting the control signal/ACK signal. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, the partitioning is performed in the time domain, wherein predetermined positions (here periodically arranged control portions <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b>) may be used.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">According to a further embodiment, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, just a frequency portion within <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> is used for transmitting the ACK. Beside this frequency portion marked by <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b>* one or two guard bands <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> <i>t</i><b>1</b>* and tc<b>4</b><i>g</i><b>2</b>* are arranged. Of course, these guard bands <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>* and <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b><i>g</i><b>2</b>* can also be arranged, when another control portion, like <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>* or <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>* or <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>3</b>* are used. This PUCCH guard band has the following advantages: when transmitting the HARQ-ACK in the PUCCH, the UE causes interference for UE receiving data on neighboring frequency resources. Hence, the UE may be configured with guard bands around the actual PUCCH transmission such that the signal power stays in the spectrum of the PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">According to embodiments, a correlation-based HARQ-ACK transmission can be used. In order to reduce the complexity of the gNB, it is proposed only to transmit an ACK signal in the PUCCH <b>10</b><i>r</i>. The ACK is transmitted using a (known) signal sequence which is easily detectable at the gNB side by using a correlation. For example, the Zadoff-Chu sequence which has the property that the cross-correlation with other Zadoff-Chu sequences with another cyclic shift results to zero. This is important in case other UEs of the same or neighboring cells also perform a similar ACK transmission on the same resource. In this scenario, the interference by these is minimized if the gNB(s) configure the different UEs with different cyclic shifts.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the misdetection probability of CP-DSSS (cyclical preference-direct sequence spread spectrum) which are constructed based on ZC sequences. As clearly visible, a robust detection of these sequences is possible even at very low SNRs, such as &#x2212;10 dB, with high interference from other sources, e.g. self-interference in the full-duplex scenario. Hence, the gNB does not have to fully compensate its own interference to enable a robust detection of the HARQ-ACK.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">According to further embodiments, some transmission slots <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> to <b>10</b><i>c</i><b>4</b> are predetermined/preconfigured, as already discussed above. It should be mentioned that the usage of the transmission slots is optional. To reduce power consumption at the gNB side, the gNB may configure the UE with specific PUCCH resources with a periodicity. In this case, the UE would be allowed to transmit HARQ-ACK only in one of these PUCCH resources such that the gNB has to perform the scanning only for these configured resources.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0086">Dynamic Starting Point&#x2014;Embodiments</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087">Below, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the principle of using a dynamic starting point (dynamic starting point grants/scheduling assignments) will be discussed.

The duration of the scanning procedure is up to detection of the preconfigured signal and/or a configured or preconfigured duration.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">According to a second option, the ACK signal (cf. embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) can be used. This HARQ-ACK detection may be performed as follows: the UE performs the same scanning procedure as described above. However, the starting signal is not transmitted by the gNB but by the UE receiving data using a rate-less HARQ procedure. This may be the HARQ-ACK signal that this UE transmits anyways to the gNB to indicate successful reception of the data.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0096">According to a third option, a so-called LBT (listening before transmitting) procedure can be performed. The UE performs an LBT procedure. For example, it starts measuring the received signal power on the frequency resource specified in the grant/scheduling assignment. Once, the received power drops below a preconfigured threshold for a certain duration the UE considers the previous transmission to be finished and starts its own reception/transmission.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0097">Although some aspects have been described in the context of an apparatus, it is clear that these aspects also represent a description of the corresponding method, where a block or device corresponds to a method step or a feature of a method step.
