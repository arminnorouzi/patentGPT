As communication technology develops, high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) and wide bandwidths for signals are required. Without remedial measures, high PAPRs and wide bandwidths tend to reduce efficiency of a transmit side power amplifier, which is typically powered by a battery. The reduction in efficiency may lead to undesirable battery drain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers at high PAPRs and at wide bandwidths, techniques such as Average Power Tracking (APT) or Envelope Tracking (ET) may be used.
