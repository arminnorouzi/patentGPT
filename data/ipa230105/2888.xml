To obtain uniform layer thickness across the substrates of a batch of wafers in a wafer boat, each of the wafers thereof may preferably be heated substantially uniformly to a carefully tuned temperature by heating means disposed proximate a side wall of the process chamber and proximate a top wall of the process chamber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been found that by tuning the temperature over the boat the layer thickness uniformity over the boat may be improved but that the quality of the deposited layers over the boat may start to show variations.
