Using the lead and electrode, a medical device may deliver or sense electrical signals to provide therapy to a patient to treat a patient condition. Medical leads may be fully implantable, percutaneously implantable, or external, and may include a distal conductive electrodes electrically and mechanically connected to one or more respective proximal electrodes, i.e., electrically conductive contacts, via one or more conductive lead wires (which also may be referred to as &#x201c;conductors&#x201d;) extending through the lead body. Electrical stimulation from a medical device may be conducted along the lead wires to be delivered across the electrode surface. Likewise, signals sensed by the distal electrodes may be conducted along the lead wires to the proximal electrodes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to some techniques of the disclosure, distal electrodes and/or proximal electrodes (i.e., contacts) of a medical lead may be re-configured from a first electrode configuration to a second electrode configuration using a flexible member placed over the first electrode configuration. The flexible member may have a first inner side with a first set of electrodes configured to electrically contact corresponding lead electrodes of the first electrode configuration. The flexible member may have a second outer side and a second set of member electrodes in a second segmented electrode configuration which is different than the first segmented electrode configuration, and at least some of the second set of member electrodes may be electrically coupled to corresponding member electrodes of the first set of member electrodes. In some examples, the flexible member reconfigures the number of electrodes at each level. In some examples, the flexible member reconfigures spacing of the electrodes along the longitudinal axis of the lead. In some examples, the flexible member reconfigures the size of one or more electrodes. In some examples, the flexible member reconfigures the position of the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an exemplary therapy system <b>10</b> including lead <b>50</b> implanted in the brain <b>49</b> of patient <b>40</b>. For ease of illustration, examples of the disclosure will primarily be described with regard to implantable electrical stimulation leads and implantable medical devices that apply neurostimulation therapy to brain <b>49</b> of patient <b>40</b> in the form of deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, the features and techniques described herein may be useful in other types of medical device systems which employ medical leads to deliver electrical stimulation to a patient and/or sense electrical signals via one or more electrodes of the lead, including other fully implantable leads, percutaneously implantable leads, or external leads. For example, the features and techniques described herein may be used in systems with medical devices that deliver stimulation therapy to a patient's heart, e.g., pacemakers, and pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillators. As other examples, the features and techniques described herein may be embodied in systems that deliver other types of neurostimulation therapy (e.g., spinal cord stimulation, sacral nerve stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, or vagus nerve stimulation), stimulation of at least one muscle or muscle groups, stimulation of at least one organ such as gastric system stimulation, stimulation concomitant to gene therapy, and, in general, stimulation of any tissue of a patient.

Lead <b>50</b> may be implanted to position electrodes <b>60</b> at desired locations of brain <b>49</b> through respective holes in cranium <b>48</b>. Lead <b>50</b> may be placed at any location within brain <b>49</b> such that electrodes <b>60</b> are capable of providing electrical stimulation to target tissue sites within brain <b>49</b> during treatment. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates system <b>10</b> as including a single lead <b>50</b> coupled to IMD <b>20</b>, in some examples, system <b>10</b> may include more than one lead, including leads positioned in different regions of the body, such as in different hemispheres of the brain or at different positions within the epidural space of the spinal cord.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Lead <b>50</b> may deliver electrical stimulation via electrodes <b>60</b> to treat any number of neurological disorders or diseases in addition to movement disorders, such as seizure disorders or psychiatric disorders. Lead <b>50</b> may be implanted within a desired location of brain <b>49</b> via any suitable technique, such as through respective burr holes in a skull of patient <b>40</b> or through a common burr hole in the cranium <b>48</b>. Lead <b>50</b> may be placed at any location within brain <b>49</b> such that electrodes <b>60</b> of lead <b>50</b> are capable of providing electrical stimulation to targeted tissue during treatment. In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, electrodes <b>60</b> of lead <b>50</b> are shown as segmented electrodes and ring electrodes. In some examples, at least one electrode of electrodes <b>60</b> is a ring electrode. In some examples, electrodes <b>60</b> are each ring electrodes. In some examples, at least one electrode of electrodes <b>60</b> is a segmented electrode. In some examples, electrodes <b>60</b> are each segmented electrodes. In some examples, lead <b>50</b> includes one or more ring electrodes and a plurality of segmented electrodes. Electrodes <b>60</b> of lead <b>50</b> may have a complex electrode array geometry that is capable of producing shaped electrical fields. In this manner, electrical stimulation may be directed to a specific direction from lead <b>50</b> to enhance therapy efficacy and reduce possible adverse side effects from stimulating a large volume of tissue.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">IMD <b>20</b> may deliver electrical stimulation therapy to brain <b>49</b> of patient <b>40</b> according to one or more stimulation therapy programs. A therapy program may define one or more electrical stimulation parameter values for therapy generated and delivered from IMD <b>20</b> to brain <b>49</b> of patient <b>40</b>. Where IMD <b>20</b> delivers electrical stimulation in the form of electrical pulses, for example, the stimulation therapy may be characterized by selected pulse parameters, such as pulse amplitude, pulse rate, and pulse width. In addition, if different electrodes are available for delivery of stimulation, the therapy may be further characterized by different electrode combinations, which can include selected electrodes and their respective polarities. The exact therapy parameter values of the stimulation therapy that helps manage or treat a patient disorder may be specific for the particular target stimulation site (e.g., the region of the brain) involved as well as the particular patient and patient condition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to delivering therapy to manage a disorder of patient <b>40</b>, therapy system <b>10</b> monitors electrical signals, such as, e.g., one or more bioelectrical brain signals of patient <b>40</b>. For example, IMD <b>20</b> may include a sensing module that senses bioelectrical brain signals within one or more regions of brain <b>49</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the signals generated by electrodes <b>60</b> are conducted to the sensing module within IMD <b>20</b> via conductors within lead <b>50</b>, including one or more conductors within lead <b>50</b> extending between distal electrodes <b>60</b> at distal end <b>54</b> and proximal electrodes (i.e., contacts) at proximal end <b>52</b> of lead <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Programmer <b>30</b> wirelessly communicates with IMD <b>20</b> as needed to provide or retrieve therapy information. Programmer <b>30</b> is an external computing device that the user, e.g., the clinician and/or patient <b>40</b>, may use to communicate with <b>1</b>MB <b>20</b>. For example, programmer <b>30</b> may be a clinician programmer that the clinician uses to communicate with <b>1</b>MB <b>20</b> and program one or more therapy programs for IMD <b>20</b>. Alternatively, programmer <b>30</b> may be a patient programmer that allows patient <b>40</b> to select programs and/or view and modify therapy parameters. The clinician programmer may include more programming features than the patient programmer. In other words, more complex or sensitive tasks may only be allowed by the clinician programmer to prevent an untrained patient from making undesired changes to IMD <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Programmer <b>30</b> may be a hand-held computing device with a display viewable by the user and an interface for providing input to programmer <b>30</b> (i.e., a user input mechanism). In other examples, programmer <b>30</b> may be a larger workstation or a separate application within another multi-function device, rather than a dedicated computing device. For example, the multi-function device may be a notebook computer, tablet computer, workstation, cellular phone, personal digital assistant, or another computing device that may run an application that enables the computing device to operate as a secure medical device programmer <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Again, while lead <b>50</b> is described here for use in DBS applications, lead <b>50</b> or other leads may be implanted at any other location within patient <b>40</b>. For example, lead <b>50</b> may be implanted near the spinal cord, pudendal nerve, sacral nerve, or any other nervous or muscle tissue that may be stimulated. The user interface described herein may be used to program the stimulation parameters of any type of stimulation therapy. In the case of pelvic nerves, defining a stimulation field may allow the clinician to stimulate multiple desired nerves without placing multiple leads deep into patient <b>40</b> and adjacent to sensitive nerve tissue. Therapy may also be changed if leads migrate to new locations within the tissue or patient <b>40</b> no longer perceives therapeutic effects of the stimulation. The features or techniques of this disclosure may be useful in other types of medical applications.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating components of IMD <b>20</b>.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, IMD <b>20</b> includes processor circuitry <b>24</b> (also referred to as &#x201c;processor&#x201d;), memory <b>26</b>, stimulation generator <b>21</b>, sensing module <b>22</b>, telemetry module <b>23</b>, sensor <b>25</b>, and power source <b>29</b>. Each of these components (also referred to as &#x201c;modules&#x201d; may be or include electrical circuitry configured to perform the functions attributed to each respective module). For example, processor <b>24</b> may include processing circuitry, stimulation generator <b>21</b> may include switch circuitry, sensing module <b>22</b> may include sensing circuitry, and telemetry module <b>23</b> may include telemetry circuitry. Memory <b>26</b> may include any volatile or non-volatile media, such as a random-access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), non-volatile RAM (NVRAM), electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), flash memory, and the like. Memory <b>26</b> may store computer-readable instructions that, when executed by processor <b>24</b>, cause IMD <b>20</b> to perform various functions. Memory <b>26</b> may be a storage device or other non-transitory medium.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Processor <b>24</b> may include any one or more of a microprocessor, a controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), discrete logic circuitry, or any other processing circuitry configured to provide the functions attributed to processor <b>24</b> herein may be embodied as firmware, hardware, software or any combination thereof. Processor <b>24</b> controls stimulation generator <b>21</b> to apply particular stimulation parameter values, such as amplitude, pulse width, and pulse rate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, lead <b>50</b> includes electrodes <b>60</b> located at distal end <b>54</b>. Processor <b>24</b> also controls stimulation generator <b>21</b> to generate and apply the stimulation signals to selected combinations of electrodes of the electrode module. In some examples, stimulation generator <b>21</b> includes a switch module that couples stimulation signals to selected conductors within lead <b>50</b>, which, in turn, delivers the stimulation signals across selected electrodes. Such a switch module may be a switch array, switch matrix, multiplexer, or any other type of switching module configured to selectively couple stimulation energy to selected electrodes and to selectively sense bioelectrical neural signals of the spine with selected electrodes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other examples, however, stimulation generator <b>21</b> does not include a switch module. In these examples, stimulation generator <b>21</b> comprises a plurality of pairs of voltage sources, current sources, voltage sinks, or current sinks connected to each of electrodes such that each pair of electrodes has a unique signal generator. In other words, in these examples, each of electrodes <b>60</b> is independently controlled via its own signal generator (e.g., via a combination of a regulated voltage source and sink or regulated current source and sink), as opposed to switching signals between electrodes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Stimulation generator <b>21</b> may be a single channel or multi-channel stimulation generator. In particular, stimulation generator <b>21</b> may be capable of delivering a single stimulation pulse or multiple stimulation pulses at a given time via a single electrode combination or multiple stimulation pulses at a given time via multiple electrode combinations. In some examples, however, stimulation generator <b>21</b> may be configured to deliver multiple channels on a time-interleaved basis. For example, a switch module of stimulation generator <b>21</b> may serve to time divide the output of stimulation generator <b>21</b> across different electrode combinations at different times to deliver multiple programs or channels of stimulation energy to patient <b>40</b>. In another example, the stimulation generator <b>21</b> may control the independent sources or sinks on a time-interleaved bases.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Lead <b>50</b> may include distal end <b>54</b> including a complex electrode array geometry, but may also include one or more single ring electrodes along the longitudinal axis in other examples.

In this manner, electrodes may be selected along the longitudinal axis of lead <b>50</b> and along the circumference of the lead. Selectively activating electrodes <b>60</b> of lead <b>50</b> can produce customizable stimulation fields that may be directed to a particular side of lead <b>50</b> in order to isolate the stimulation field around the target anatomical region of brain <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although sensing module <b>22</b> is incorporated into a common housing with stimulation generator <b>21</b> and processor <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in other examples, sensing module <b>22</b> may be in a separate housing from IMD <b>20</b> and may communicate with processor <b>24</b> via wired or wireless communication techniques. Example bioelectrical signals include, but are not limited to, local field potentials (LFPs), evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs), or other signals within one or more regions of the spine or brain, for example.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Sensor <b>25</b> may include one or more sensing elements that sense values of a respective patient parameter.

IMD <b>20</b> may include additional sensors within the housing of IMD <b>20</b> and/or coupled as a separate module via one of lead <b>50</b> or other leads. In addition, IMD <b>20</b> may receive sensor signals wirelessly from remote sensors via telemetry module <b>23</b>, for example. In some examples, one or more of these remote sensors may be external to patient (e.g., carried on the external surface of the skin, attached to clothing, or otherwise positioned external to the patient).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Telemetry module <b>23</b> supports wireless communication between IMD <b>20</b> and an external programmer (e.g., such as programmer <b>30</b>) or another computing device under the control of processor <b>24</b>.

The updates to the therapy programs may be stored within therapy programs <b>27</b> portion of memory <b>26</b>. Telemetry module <b>23</b> in IMD <b>20</b>, as well as telemetry modules in other devices and systems described herein, such as programmer <b>30</b>, may accomplish communication by radiofrequency (RF) communication techniques. In addition, telemetry module <b>23</b> may communicate with external medical device programmer <b>30</b> via proximal inductive interaction of IMD <b>20</b> with programmer <b>30</b>.
