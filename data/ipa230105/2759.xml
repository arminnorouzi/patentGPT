Upon exposure to a virus, short segments of viral DNA are integrated into the CRISPR locus. RNA is transcribed from a portion of the CRISPR locus that includes the viral sequence. That RNA, which contains sequence complementary to the viral genome, mediates targeting of a Cas protein (e.g., Cas9 protein) to the sequence in the viral genome. The Cas protein cleaves and thereby silences the viral target.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted for genome editing in eukaryotic cells. The introduction of site-specific double strand breaks (DSBs) enables target sequence alteration through one of two endogenous DNA repair mechanisms-either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). The CRISPR/Cas system has also been used for gene regulation including transcription repression and activation without altering the target sequence. Targeted gene regulation based on the CRISPR/Cas system can, for example, use an enzymatically inactive Cas9 (also known as a catalytically dead Cas9).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, methods and compositions discussed herein provide for efficient gene editing of eukaryotic cells. In particular, we have found that the guide RNA (gRNA) component of the CRISPR/Cas system is more efficient at editing genes in certain cell types ex vivo when it has been modified at or near its 5&#x2032; end (e.g., when the 5&#x2032; end of a gRNA is modified by the inclusion of a eukaryotic mRNA cap structure or cap analog) and/or when it has been modified to include a 3&#x2032; polyA tail. gRNA is not an mRNA and it was therefore unexpected that these mRNA structures should lead to such an improvement. We have also demonstrated that the presence of a 3&#x2032; polyA tails with defined lengths can also lead to improved gene editing and that the combination of a 5&#x2032; end modification and a 3&#x2032; polyA tail can lead to even further improvements. While not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that these and other modified gRNAs described herein exhibit enhanced stability with certain cell types (e.g., circulating cells such as T cells) and that this might be responsible for the observed improvements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention also encompasses the realization that the improvements observed with a gRNA with 5&#x2032; caps and/or 3&#x2032; polyA tails can be extended to gRNAs that have been modified in other ways to achieve the same type of structural or functional result (e.g., by the inclusion of modified nucleosides or nucleotides, or when an in vitro transcribed gRNA is modified by treatment with a phosphatase to remove the 5&#x2032; triphosphate group).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a gRNA molecule comprising a targeting domain which is complementary with a target domain from a gene expressed in a eukaryotic cell, wherein the gRNA molecule is modified at its 5&#x2032; end and comprises a 3&#x2032; polyA tail. The gRNA molecule may, for example, lack a 5&#x2032; triphosphate group (e.g., the 5&#x2032; end of the targeting domain lacks a 5&#x2032; triphosphate group). The gRNA molecule may alternatively include a 5&#x2032; cap (e.g., the 5&#x2032; end of the targeting domain includes a 5&#x2032; cap). In some embodiments, the 5&#x2032; cap comprises a modified guanine nucleotide that is linked to the remainder of the gRNA molecule via a 5&#x2032;-5&#x2032; triphosphate linkage. In some embodiments, the 5&#x2032; cap comprises two optionally modified guanine nucleotides that are linked via an optionally modified 5&#x2032;-5&#x2032; triphosphate linkage.

ALT-HDR is distinct from canonical HDR in that the process utilizes different pathways from canonical HDR, and can be inhibited by the canonical HDR mediators, RAD51 and BRCA2. Also, ALT-HDR uses a single-stranded or nicked homologous nucleic acid for repair of the break.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0161">&#x201c;Canonical HDR&#x201d;, or canonical homology-directed repair, as used herein, refers to the process of repairing DNA damage using a homologous nucleic acid (e.g., an endogenous homologous sequence, e.g., a sister chromatid, or an exogenous nucleic acid, e.g., a template nucleic acid). Canonical HDR typically acts when there has been significant resection at the double strand break, forming at least one single stranded portion of DNA. In a normal cell, HDR typically involves a series of steps such as recognition of the break, stabilization of the break, resection, stabilization of single stranded DNA, formation of a DNA crossover intermediate, resolution of the crossover intermediate, and ligation. The process requires RAD51 and BRCA2, and the homologous nucleic acid is typically double-stranded.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0162">Unless indicated otherwise, the term &#x201c;HDR&#x201d; as used herein encompasses canonical HDR and alt-HDR.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0163">&#x201c;Domain&#x201d;, as used herein, is used to describe segments of a protein or nucleic acid. Unless otherwise indicated, a domain is not required to have any specific functional property.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0164">Calculations of homology or sequence identity between two sequences (the terms are used interchangeably herein) are performed as follows. The sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The optimal alignment is determined as the best score using the GAP program in the GCG software package with a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frame shift gap penalty of 5. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0165">&#x201c;Governing gRNA molecule&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a gRNA molecule that comprises a targeting domain that is complementary to a target domain on a nucleic acid that comprises a sequence that encodes a component of the CRISPR/Cas system that is introduced into a cell. A governing gRNA does not target an endogenous cell. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule comprises a targeting domain that is complementary with a target sequence on: (a) a nucleic acid that encodes a Cas (e.g., Cas9) molecule; (b) a nucleic acid that encodes a gRNA which comprises a targeting domain for a gene (a target gene gRNA); or on more than one nucleic acid that encodes a CRISPR/Cas component, e.g., both (a) and (b). In an embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a CRISPR/Cas component, e.g., that encodes a Cas9 molecule or a target gene gRNA, comprises more than one target domain that is complementary with a governing gRNA targeting domain. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in such embodiments a governing gRNA molecule complexes with a Cas9 molecule and results in Cas9 mediated inactivation of the targeted nucleic acid, e.g., by cleavage or by binding to the nucleic acid, and results in cessation or reduction of the production of a CRISPR/Cas system component. In an embodiment, the Cas9 molecule forms two complexes: a complex comprising a Cas9 molecule with a target gene gRNA, which complex will alter the gene; and a complex comprising a Cas9 molecule with a governing gRNA molecule, which complex will act to prevent further production of a CRISPR/Cas system component, e.g., a Cas9 molecule or a target gene gRNA molecule. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule/Cas molecule (e.g., gRNA molecule/Cas9 molecule) complex binds to or promotes cleavage of a control region sequence, e.g., a promoter, operably linked to a sequence that encodes a Cas9 molecule, a sequence that encodes a transcribed region, an exon, or an intron, for the Cas9 molecule. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule/Cas molecule (e.g., gRNA molecule/Cas9 molecule) complex binds to or promotes cleavage of a control region sequence, e.g., a promoter, operably linked to a gRNA molecule, or a sequence that encodes the gRNA molecule. In an embodiment, the governing gRNA, e.g., a Cas9-targeting governing gRNA molecule, or a target gene gRNA-targeting governing gRNA molecule, limits the effect of the Cas9 molecule/target gene gRNA molecule complex-mediated gene targeting. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA places temporal, level of expression, or other limits, on activity of the Cas9 molecule/target gene gRNA molecule complex. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA reduces off-target or other unwanted activity. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule inhibits, e.g., entirely or substantially entirely inhibits, the production of a component of the Cas9 system and thereby limits, or governs, its activity.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0166">&#x201c;Modulator&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an entity, e.g., a drug, which can alter the activity (e.g., enzymatic activity, transcriptional activity, or translational activity), amount, distribution, or structure of a subject molecule or genetic sequence. In an embodiment, modulation comprises cleavage, e.g., breaking of a covalent or non-covalent bond, or the forming of a covalent or non-covalent bond, e.g., the attachment of a moiety, to the subject molecule. In an embodiment, a modulator alters the, three dimensional, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure, of a subject molecule.

For example, a Cas9 molecule can be characterized as having no more than 10% of the nuclease activity of a reference Cas9 molecule. Examples of reference Cas9 molecules include naturally occurring unmodified Cas9 molecules, e.g., a naturally occurring Cas9 molecule such as a Cas9 molecule of <i>S. pyogenes, S. aureus</i>, or <i>S. thermophilus</i>. In an embodiment, the reference Cas9 molecule is the naturally occurring Cas9 molecule having the closest sequence identity or homology with the Cas9 molecule to which it is being compared.

In an embodiment, a 5&#x2032; cap is not used and the gRNA (e.g., an in vitro transcribed gRNA) is instead modified by treatment with a phosphatase (e.g., calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) to remove the 5&#x2032; triphosphate group.</p><p id="p-0567" num="0599">Methods and compositions discussed herein also provide methods and compositions for gene editing by using gRNAs which comprise a 3&#x2032; polyA tail (also called a polyA tract herein). Such gRNAs may, for example, be prepared by adding a polyA tail to a gRNA molecule precursor using a polyadenosine polymerase following in vitro transcription of the gRNA molecule precursor. For example, in one embodiment, a polyA tail may be added enzymatically using a polymerase such as <i>E. coli </i>polyA polymerase (E-PAP). gRNAs including a polyA tail may also be prepared by in vitro transcription from a DNA template. In one embodiment, a polyA tail of defined length is encoded on a DNA template and transcribed with the gRNA via an RNA polymerase (such as T7 RNA polymerase). gRNAs with a polyA tail may also be prepared by ligating a polyA oligonucleotide to a gRNA molecule precursor following in vitro transcription using an RNA ligase or a DNA ligase with or without a splinted DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the gRNA molecule precursor and the polyA oligonucleotide. For example, in one embodiment, a polyA tail of defined length is synthesized as a synthetic oligonucleotide and ligated on the 3&#x2032; end of the gRNA with either an RNA ligase or a DNA ligase with or without a splinted DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the guide RNA and the polyA oligonucleotide. gRNAs including the polyA tail may also be prepared synthetically, in one or several pieces that are ligated together by either an RNA ligase or a DNA ligase with or without one or more splinted DNA oligonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0568" num="0600">In some embodiments, the polyA tail is comprised of fewer than 50 adenine nucleotides, for example, fewer than 45 adenine nucleotides, fewer than 40 adenine nucleotides, fewer than 35 adenine nucleotides, fewer than 30 adenine nucleotides, fewer than 25 adenine nucleotides or fewer than 20 adenine nucleotides. In some embodiments the polyA tail is comprised of between 5 and 50 adenine nucleotides, for example between 5 and 40 adenine nucleotides, between 5 and 30 adenine nucleotides, between 10 and 50 adenine nucleotides, or between 15 and 25 adenine nucleotides.

Off target activity may be other than cleavage. For example, for each possible gRNA choice using <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9, software tools can identify all potential off-target sequences (preceding either NAG or NGG PAMs) across the genome that contain up to a certain number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) of mismatched base-pairs. The cleavage efficiency at each off-target sequence can be predicted, e.g., using an experimentally-derived weighting scheme. Each possible gRNA can then be ranked according to its total predicted off-target cleavage; the top-ranked gRNAs represent those that are likely to have the greatest on-target and the least off-target cleavage. Other functions, e.g., automated reagent design for gRNA vector construction, primer design for the on-target Surveyor assay, and primer design for high-throughput detection and quantification of off-target cleavage via next-generation sequencing, can also be included in the tool. Candidate gRNA molecules can be evaluated by art-known methods or as described in Section IV herein.</p><p id="p-0587" num="0614">In some embodiments, gRNAs for use with <i>S. pyogenes, S. aureus</i>, and <i>N. meningitidis </i>Cas9s are identified using a DNA sequence searching algorithm, e.g., using a custom gRNA design software based on the public tool cas-offinder (Bae et al. Bioinformatics. 2014; 30(10): 1473-1475). Said custom gRNA design software scores guides after calculating their genomewide off-target propensity. Typically matches ranging from perfect matches to 7 mismatches are considered for guides ranging in length from 17 to 24. Once the off-target sites are computationally determined, an aggregate score is calculated for each guide and summarized in a tabular output using a web-interface. In addition to identifying potential gRNA sites adjacent to PAM sequences, the software also identifies all PAM adjacent sequences that differ by 1, 2, 3 or more nucleotides from the selected gRNA sites. Genomic DNA sequence for each gene are obtained from the UCSC Genome browser and sequences are screened for repeat elements using the publicly available RepeatMasker program.

The REC lobe does not share structural similarity with other known proteins, indicating that it is a Cas9-specific functional domain. The BH domain is a long a-helix and arginine rich region and comprises amino acids 60-93 of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9. The REC1 domain is important for recognition of the repeat:anti-repeat duplex, e.g., of a gRNA or a tracrRNA, and is therefore critical for Cas9 activity by recognizing the target sequence. The REC1 domain comprises two REC1 motifs at amino acids 94 to 179 and 308 to 717 of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9. These two REC1 domains, though separated by the REC2 domain in the linear primary structure, assemble in the tertiary structure to form the REC1 domain. The REC2 domain, or parts thereof, may also play a role in the recognition of the repeat:anti-repeat duplex. The REC2 domain comprises amino acids 180-307 of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0642">The NUC lobe comprises the RuvC domain (also referred to herein as RuvC-like domain), the HNH domain (also referred to herein as HNH-like domain), and the PAM-interacting (PI) domain. The RuvC domain shares structural similarity to retroviral integrase superfamily members and cleaves a single strand, e.g., the non-complementary strand of the target nucleic acid molecule. The RuvC domain is assembled from the three split RuvC motifs (RuvC I, RuvCII, and RuvCIII, which are often commonly referred to in the art as RuvCI domain, or N-terminal RuvC domain, RuvCII domain, and RuvCIII domain) at amino acids 1-59, 718-769, and 909-1098, respectively, of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9. Similar to the REC1 domain, the three RuvC motifs are linearly separated by other domains in the primary structure, however in the tertiary structure, the three RuvC motifs assemble and form the RuvC domain. The HNH domain shares structural similarity with HNH endonucleases, and cleaves a single strand, e.g., the complementary strand of the target nucleic acid molecule. The HNH domain lies between the RuvC II-III motifs and comprises amino acids 775-908 of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9. The PI domain interacts with the PAM of the target nucleic acid molecule, and comprises amino acids 1099-1368 of the sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0643">A RuvC-Like Domain and an HNH-Like Domain</p><p id="p-0613" num="0644">In an embodiment, a Cas9 molecule or Cas9 polypeptide comprises an HNH-like domain and a RuvC-like domain.

For example, the synthetic nucleic acid molecule can be chemically modified, e.g., as described in Section VIII. In an embodiment, the Cas9 mRNA has one or more (e.g., all of the following properties: it is capped, polyadenylated, substituted with 5-methylcytidine and/or pseudouridine.</p><p id="p-0832" num="0955">In addition, or alternatively, the synthetic nucleic acid sequence can be codon optimized, e.g., at least one non-common codon or less-common codon has been replaced by a common codon. For example, the synthetic nucleic acid can direct the synthesis of an optimized messenger mRNA, e.g., optimized for expression in a mammalian expression system, e.g., described herein. In addition, or alternatively, a nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 molecule or Cas9 polypeptide may comprise a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Nuclear localization sequences are known in the art. An exemplary codon optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding a Cas9 molecule of <i>S. pyogenes </i>is provided as SEQ ID NO:22 with the corresponding amino acid sequence as SEQ ID NO:23. An exemplary codon optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding a Cas9 molecule of <i>N. meningitidis </i>is provided as SEQ ID NO:24 with the corresponding amino acid sequence as SEQ ID NO:25. Exemplary codon optimized nucleic acid sequences encoding a Cas9 molecule of <i>S. aureus </i>are provided as SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:415, and SEQ ID NO:416 with the corresponding amino acid sequence as SEQ ID NO:26. An exemplary codon optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding a Cas9 molecule of <i>S. aureus </i>Cas9 nickase D10A is provided as SEQ ID NO:417. An exemplary codon optimized nucleic acid sequence encoding a Cas9 molecule of <i>S. aureus </i>Cas9 nickase N580A is provided as SEQ ID NO:418.

In this assay, synthetic or in vitro-transcribed gRNA molecule is pre-annealed prior to the reaction by heating to 95&#xb0; C. and slowly cooling down to room temperature. Native or restriction digest-linearized plasmid DNA (300 ng (&#x2dc;8 nM)) is incubated for 60 min at 37&#xb0; C. with purified Cas9 protein molecule (50-500 nM) and gRNA (50-500 nM, 1:1) in a Cas9 plasmid cleavage buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA) with or without 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The reactions are stopped with 5&#xd7;DNA loading buffer (30% glycerol, 1.2% SDS, 250 mM EDTA), resolved by a 0.8 or 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The resulting cleavage products indicate whether the Cas9 molecule cleaves both DNA strands, or only one of the two strands. For example, linear DNA products indicate the cleavage of both DNA strands. Nicked open circular products indicate that only one of the two strands is cleaved.</p><p id="p-0839" num="0961">Alternatively, the ability of a Cas9 molecule/gRNA molecule complex to bind to and cleave a target nucleic acid can be evaluated in an oligonucleotide DNA cleavage assay.

After heat inactivation (65&#xb0; C. for 20 min), reactions are purified through a column to remove unincorporated label. Duplex substrates (100 nM) are generated by annealing labeled oligonucleotides with equimolar amounts of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide at 95&#xb0; C. for 3 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. For cleavage assays, gRNA molecules are annealed by heating to 95&#xb0; C. for 30 s, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Cas9 (500 nM final concentration) is pre-incubated with the annealed gRNA molecules (500 nM) in cleavage assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol) in a total volume of 9 &#x3bc;l.

Genome Editing Approaches</heading><p id="p-0849" num="0971">Described herein are methods for targeted knockout of one or both alleles of a gene using NHEJ (see Section V.1). In another embodiment, methods are provided for targeted knockdown of a gene (see Section V.2). It is further contemplated that the disclosed methods may target two or more genes for knockdown or knockout or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0850" num="0972">Mutations in a target gene (e.g., the HBB gene) may be corrected using one of the approaches discussed herein. In an embodiment, a mutation is corrected by homology directed repair (HDR) using an exogenously provided template nucleic acid (see Section V.3). In another embodiment, a mutation is corrected by homology directed repair without using an exogenously provided template nucleic acid (see Section V.4).</p><p id="p-0851" num="0973">In general, it is to be understood that the alteration of any gene according to the methods described herein can be mediated by any mechanism and that any methods are not limited to a particular mechanism. Exemplary mechanisms that can be associated with the alteration of a gene include, but are not limited to, non-homologous end joining (e.g., classical or alternative), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), homology-directed repair (e.g., endogenous donor template mediated), SDSA (synthesis dependent strand annealing), single strand annealing or single strand invasion&#x2014;(e.g., see exemplary mechanisms in Section V.5 and Section V.6).</p><p id="p-0852" num="0974">V.1 NHEJ Approaches for Gene Targeting</p><p id="p-0853" num="0975">As described herein, nuclease-induced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can be used to target gene-specific knockouts. Nuclease-induced NHEJ can also be used to remove (e.g., delete) sequence insertions in a genge.</p><p id="p-0854" num="0976">While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that, in an embodiment, the genomic alterations associated with the methods described herein rely on nuclease-induced NHEJ and the error-prone nature of the NHEJ repair pathway. NHEJ repairs a double-strand break in the DNA by joining together the two ends; however, generally, the original sequence is restored only if two compatible ends, exactly as they were formed by the double-strand break, are perfectly ligated. The DNA ends of the double-strand break are frequently the subject of enzymatic processing, resulting in the addition or removal of nucleotides, at one or both strands, prior to rejoining of the ends. This results in the presence of insertion and/or deletion (indel) mutations in the DNA sequence at the site of the NHEJ repair. Two-thirds of these mutations typically alter the reading frame and, therefore, produce a non-functional protein. Additionally, mutations that maintain the reading frame, but which insert or delete a significant amount of sequence, can destroy functionality of the protein. This is locus dependent as mutations in critical functional domains are likely less tolerable than mutations in non-critical regions of the protein.</p><p id="p-0855" num="0977">The indel mutations generated by NHEJ are unpredictable in nature; however, at a given break site certain indel sequences are favored and are over represented in the population, likely due to small regions of microhomology. The lengths of deletions can vary widely; most commonly in the 1-50 bp range, but they can easily reach greater than 100-200 bp. Insertions tend to be shorter and often include short duplications of the sequence immediately surrounding the break site. However, it is possible to obtain large insertions, and in these cases, the inserted sequence has often been traced to other regions of the genome or to plasmid DNA present in the cells.</p><p id="p-0856" num="0978">Because NHEJ is a mutagenic process, it can also be used to delete small sequence motifs as long as the generation of a specific final sequence is not required. If a double-strand break is targeted near to a short target sequence, the deletion mutations caused by the NHEJ repair often span, and therefore remove, the unwanted nucleotides. For the deletion of larger DNA segments, introducing two double-strand breaks, one on each side of the sequence, can result in NHEJ between the ends with removal of the entire intervening sequence. Both of these approaches can be used to delete specific DNA sequences; however, the error-prone nature of NHEJ may still produce indel mutations at the site of repair.</p><p id="p-0857" num="0979">Both double strand cleaving eaCas9 molecules and single strand, or nickase, eaCas9 molecules can be used in the methods and compositions described herein to generate NHEJ-mediated indels. NHEJ-mediated indels targeted to the gene, e.g., a coding region, e.g., an early coding region of a gene can be used to knockout (i.e., eliminate expression of) a gene. For example, early coding region of a gene includes sequence immediately following a transcription start site, within a first exon of the coding sequence, or within 500 bp of the transcription start site (e.g., less than 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100 or 50 bp).</p><p id="p-0858" num="0980">Placement of Double Strand or Single Strand Breaks Relative to the Target Position</p><p id="p-0859" num="0981">In an embodiment, in which a gRNA and Cas9 nuclease generate a double strand break for the purpose of inducing NHEJ-mediated indels, a gRNA, e.g., a unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA molecule, is configured to position one double-strand break in close proximity to a nucleotide of the target position. In an embodiment, the cleavage site is between 0-30 bp away from the target position (e.g., less than 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 bp from the target position).</p><p id="p-0860" num="0982">In an embodiment, in which two gRNAs complexing with Cas9 nickases induce two single strand breaks for the purpose of inducing NHEJ-mediated indels, two gRNAs, e.g., independently, unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA, are configured to position two single-strand breaks to provide for NHEJ repair a nucleotide of the target position. In an embodiment, the gRNAs are configured to position cuts at the same position, or within a few nucleotides of one another, on different strands, essentially mimicking a double strand break. In an embodiment, the closer nick is between 0-30 bp away from the target position (e.g., less than 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 bp from the target position), and the two nicks are within 25-55 bp of each other (e.g., between 25 to 50, 25 to 45, 25 to 40, 25 to 35, 25 to 30, 50 to 55, 45 to 55, 40 to 55, 35 to 55, 30 to 55, 30 to 50, 35 to 50, 40 to 50, 45 to 50, 35 to 45, or 40 to 45 bp) and no more than 100 by away from each other (e.g., no more than 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 bp). In an embodiment, the gRNAs are configured to place a single strand break on either side of a nucleotide of the target position.</p><p id="p-0861" num="0983">Both double strand cleaving eaCas9 molecules and single strand, or nickase, eaCas9 molecules can be used in the methods and compositions described herein to generate breaks both sides of a target position. Double strand or paired single strand breaks may be generated on both sides of a target position to remove the nucleic acid sequence between the two cuts (e.g., the region between the two breaks in deleted). In an embodiment, two gRNAs, e.g., independently, unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA, are configured to position a double-strand break on both sides of a target position. In an alternate embodiment, three gRNAs, e.g., independently, unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA, are configured to position a double strand break (i.e., one gRNA complexes with a cas9 nuclease) and two single strand breaks or paired single stranded breaks (i.e., two gRNAs complex with Cas9 nickases) on either side of the target position. In another embodiment, four gRNAs, e.g., independently, unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA, are configured to generate two pairs of single stranded breaks (i.e., two pairs of two gRNAs complex with Cas9 nickases) on either side of the target position. The double strand break(s) or the closer of the two single strand nicks in a pair will ideally be within 0-500 bp of the target position (e.g., no more than 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 50 or 25 bp from the target position). When nickases are used, the two nicks in a pair are within 25-55 bp of each other (e.g., between 25 to 50, 25 to 45, 25 to 40, 25 to 35, 25 to 30, 50 to 55, 45 to 55, 40 to 55, 35 to 55, 30 to 55, 30 to 50, 35 to 50, 40 to 50, 45 to 50, 35 to 45, or 40 to 45 bp) and no more than 100 by away from each other (e.g., no more than 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 bp).</p><p id="p-0862" num="0984">V.2 Targeted Knockdown</p><p id="p-0863" num="0985">Unlike CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene knockout, which permanently eliminates or reduces expression by mutating the gene at the DNA level, CRISPR/Cas knockdown allows for temporary reduction of gene expression through the use of artificial transcription factors. Mutating key residues in both DNA cleavage domains of the Cas9 protein (e.g., the D10A and H840A or N863A mutations) results in the generation of a catalytically inactive Cas9 (eiCas9 which is also known as dead Cas9 or dCas9). A catalytically inactive Cas9 complexes with a gRNA and localizes to the DNA sequence specified by that gRNA's targeting domain, however, it does not cleave the target DNA. Fusion of the dCas9 to an effector domain, e.g., a transcription repression domain, enables recruitment of the effector to any DNA site specified by the gRNA. While it has been shown that the eiCas9 itself can block transcription when recruited to early regions in the coding sequence, more robust repression can be achieved by fusing a transcriptional repression domain (for example KRAB, SID or ERD) to the Cas9 and recruiting it to the promoter region of a gene. It is likely that targeting DNAseI hypersensitive regions of the promoter may yield more efficient gene repression or activation because these regions are more likely to be accessible to the Cas9 protein and are also more likely to harbor sites for endogenous transcription factors. Especially for gene repression, it is contemplated herein that blocking the binding site of an endogenous transcription factor would aid in downregulating gene expression. In an embodiment, one or more eiCas9s may be used to block binding of one or more endogenous transcription factors. In another embodiment, an eiCas9 can be fused to a chromatin modifying protein. Altering chromatin status can result in decreased expression of the target gene. One or more eiCas9s fused to one or more chromatin modifying proteins may be used to alter chromatin status.</p><p id="p-0864" num="0986">In an embodiment, a gRNA molecule can be targeted to a known transcription response elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers, etc.), a known upstream activating sequences (UAS), and/or sequences of unknown or known function that are suspected of being able to control expression of the target DNA.</p><p id="p-0865" num="0987">CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene knockdown can be used to reduce expression of an unwanted allele or transcript. Contemplated herein are scenarios wherein permanent destruction of the gene is not ideal. In these scenarios, site-specific repression may be used to temporarily reduce or eliminate expression. It is also contemplated herein that the off-target effects of a Cas-repressor may be less severe than those of a Cas-nuclease as a nuclease can cleave any DNA sequence and cause mutations whereas a Cas-repressor may only have an effect if it targets the promoter region of an actively transcribed gene. However, while nuclease-mediated knockout is permanent, repression may only persist as long as the Cas-repressor is present in the cells. Once the repressor is no longer present, it is likely that endogenous transcription factors and gene regulatory elements would restore expression to its natural state.</p><p id="p-0866" num="0988">V.3 HDR Repair, HDR Mediated Knockin, and Template Nucleic Acids</p><p id="p-0867" num="0989">As described herein, nuclease-induced homology directed repair (HDR) can be used to alter a target sequence and correct (e.g., repair or edit) a mutation in the genome. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that alteration of the target sequence occurs by homology-directed repair (HDR) with an exogenously provided donor template or template nucleic acid. For example, the donor template or the template nucleic acid provides for alteration of the target sequence. It is contemplated that a plasmid donor can be used as a template for homologous recombination. It is further contemplated that a single stranded donor template can be used as a template for alteration of the target sequence by alternate methods of homology directed repair (e.g., single strand annealing) between the target sequence and the donor template. Donor template-effected alteration of a target sequence depends on cleavage by a Cas9 molecule. Cleavage by Cas9 can comprise a double strand break or two single strand breaks. As described herein, nuclease-induced homology directed repair (HDR) can be used to alter a target sequence and correct (e.g., repair or edit) a mutation in the genome without the use of an exogenously provided donor template or template nucleic acid. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that alteration of the target sequence occurs by homology-directed repair (HDR) with endogenous genomic donor sequence. For example, the endogenous genomic donor sequence provides for alteration of the target sequence. It is contemplated that in an embodiment the endogenous genomic donor sequence is located on the same chromosome as the target sequence. It is further contemplated that in another embodiment the endogenous genomic donor sequence is located on a different chromosome from the target sequence. In an embodiment, the endogenous genomic donor sequence comprises one or more nucleotides derived from the HBB gene. Alteration of a target sequence by endogenous genomic donor sequence depends on cleavage by a Cas9 molecule. Cleavage by Cas9 can comprise a double strand break or two single strand breaks.</p><p id="p-0868" num="0990">Mutations that can be corrected by HDR using a template nucleic acid, or using endogenous genomic donor sequence, include point mutations. In an embodiment, a point mutation can be corrected by either a single double-strand break or two single strand breaks. In an embodiment, a point mutation can be corrected by (1) a single double-strand break, (2) two single strand breaks, (3) two double stranded breaks with a break occurring on each side of the target position, (4) one double stranded break and two single strand breaks with the double strand break and two single strand breaks occurring on each side of the target position (5) four single stranded breaks with a pair of single stranded breaks occurring on each side of the target position, or (6) one single stranded break.</p><p id="p-0869" num="0991">In an embodiment where a single-stranded template nucleic acid is used, the target position can be altered by alternative HDR.</p><p id="p-0870" num="0992">Donor template-effected alteration of a target position depends on cleavage by a Cas9 molecule. Cleavage by Cas9 can comprise a nick, a double strand break, or two single strand breaks, e.g., one on each strand of the target nucleic acid. After introduction of the breaks on the target nucleic acid, resection occurs at the break ends resulting in single stranded overhanging DNA regions.</p><p id="p-0871" num="0993">In canonical HDR, a double-stranded donor template is introduced, comprising homologous sequence to the target nucleic acid that will either be directly incorporated into the target nucleic acid or used as a template to correct the sequence of the target nucleic acid. After resection at the break, repair can progress by different pathways, e.g., by the double Holliday junction model (or double strand break repair, DSBR, pathway) or the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. In the double Holliday junction model, strand invasion by the two single stranded overhangs of the target nucleic acid to the homologous sequences in the donor template occurs, resulting in the formation of an intermediate with two Holliday junctions. The junctions migrate as new DNA is synthesized from the ends of the invading strand to fill the gap resulting from the resection. The end of the newly synthesized DNA is ligated to the resected end, and the junctions are resolved, resulting in the correction of the target nucleic acid, e.g., incorporation of the correct sequence of the donor template at the corresponding target position. Crossover with the donor template may occur upon resolution of the junctions. In the SDSA pathway, only one single stranded overhang invades the donor template and new DNA is synthesized from the end of the invading strand to fill the gap resulting from resection. The newly synthesized DNA then anneals to the remaining single stranded overhang, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap, and the strands are ligated to produce the corrected DNA duplex.</p><p id="p-0872" num="0994">In alternative HDR, a single strand donor template, e.g., template nucleic acid, is introduced. A nick, single strand break, or double strand break at the target nucleic acid, for altering a desired target position, is mediated by a Cas9 molecule, e.g., described herein, and resection at the break occurs to reveal single stranded overhangs. Incorporation of the sequence of the template nucleic acid to correct or alter the target position of the target nucleic acid typically occurs by the SDSA pathway, as described above.</p><p id="p-0873" num="0995">Methods of promoting HDR pathways, e.g., canonical HDR or alt-HDR, are described herein in Section VI.</p><p id="p-0874" num="0996">Additional details on template nucleic acids are provided in Section IV entitled &#x201c;Template nucleic acids&#x201d; in International Application PCT/US2014/057905.</p><p id="p-0875" num="0997">Mutations in the HBB gene that can be corrected (e.g., altered) by HDR with a template nucleic acid or with endogenous genomic donor sequence include, e.g., point mutation at E6, e.g., E6V.</p><p id="p-0876" num="0998">Double Strand Break Mediated Correction or Knockin</p><p id="p-0877" num="0999">In an embodiment, double strand cleavage is effected by a Cas9 molecule having cleavage activity associated with an HNH-like domain and cleavage activity associated with a RuvC-like domain, e.g., an N-terminal RuvC-like domain, e.g., a wild type Cas9. Such embodiments require only a single gRNA.</p><p id="p-0878" num="1000">Single Strand Break Mediated Correction or Knockin</p><p id="p-0879" num="1001">In some embodiments, one single strand break, or nick, is effected by a Cas9 molecule having nickase activity, e.g., a Cas9 nickase as described herein. A nicked target nucleic acid can be a substrate for alt-HDR.</p><p id="p-0880" num="1002">In other embodiments, two single strand breaks, or nicks, are effected by a Cas9 molecule having nickase activity, e.g., cleavage activity associated with an HNH-like domain or cleavage activity associated with an N-terminal RuvC-like domain. Such embodiments usually require two gRNAs, one for placement of each single strand break. In an embodiment, the Cas9 molecule having nickase activity cleaves the strand to which the gRNA hybridizes, but not the strand that is complementary to the strand to which the gRNA hybridizes. In an embodiment, the Cas9 molecule having nickase activity does not cleave the strand to which the gRNA hybridizes, but rather cleaves the strand that is complementary to the strand to which the gRNA hybridizes.</p><p id="p-0881" num="1003">In an embodiment, the nickase has HNH activity, e.g., a Cas9 molecule having the RuvC activity inactivated, e.g., a Cas9 molecule having a mutation at D10, e.g., the D10A mutation. D10A inactivates RuvC; therefore, the Cas9 nickase has (only) HNH activity and will cut on the strand to which the gRNA hybridizes (e.g., the complementary strand, which does not have the NGG PAM on it). In other embodiments, a Cas9 molecule having an H840, e.g., an H840A, mutation can be used as a nickase. H840A inactivates HNH; therefore, the Cas9 nickase has (only) RuvC activity and cuts on the non-complementary strand (e.g., the strand that has the NGG PAM and whose sequence is identical to the gRNA). In an embodiment, the Cas9 molecule is an N-terminal RuvC-like domain nickase, e.g., the Cas9 molecule comprises a mutation at N863, e.g., N863A.</p><p id="p-0882" num="1004">In an embodiment, in which a nickase and two gRNAs are used to position two single strand nicks, one nick is on the + strand and one nick is on the&#x2014;strand of the target nucleic acid. The PAMs are outwardly facing. The gRNAs can be selected such that the gRNAs are separated by, from about 0-50, 0-100, or 0-200 nucleotides. In an embodiment, there is no overlap between the target sequences that are complementary to the targeting domains of the two gRNAs. In an embodiment, the gRNAs do not overlap and are separated by as much as 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides. In an embodiment, the use of two gRNAs can increase specificity, e.g., by decreasing off-target binding (Ran et al., Cell 2013).</p><p id="p-0883" num="1005">In an embodiment, a single nick can be used to induce HDR, e.g., alt-HDR. It is contemplated herein that a single nick can be used to increase the ratio of HR to NHEJ at a given cleavage site. In an embodiment, a single strand break is formed in the strand of the target nucleic acid to which the targeting domain of said gRNA is complementary. In another embodiment, a single strand break is formed in the strand of the target nucleic acid other than the strand to which the targeting domain of said gRNA is complementary.</p><p id="p-0884" num="1006">Placement of the Double Strand Break or a Single Strand Break Relative to the Target Position</p><p id="p-0885" num="1007">The double strand break or single strand break in one of the strands should be sufficiently close to target position such that an alteration is produced in the desired region, e.g., correction of a mutation occurs. In an embodiment, the distance is not more than 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 350, 400 or 500 nucleotides. While not wishing to be bound by theory, in some embodiments, it is believed that the break should be sufficiently close to target position such that the target position is within the region that is subject to exonuclease-mediated removal during end resection. If the distance between the target position and a break is too great, the mutation or other sequence desired to be altered may not be included in the end resection and, therefore, may not be corrected, as donor sequence, either exogenously provided donor sequence or endogenous genomic donor sequence, in some embodiments is only used to correct sequence within the end resection region.</p><p id="p-0886" num="1008">In an embodiment, the targeting domain is configured such that a cleavage event, e.g., a double strand or single strand break, is positioned within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 350, 400 or 500 nucleotides of the region desired to be altered, e.g., a mutation. The break, e.g., a double strand or single strand break, can be positioned upstream or downstream of the region desired to be altered, e.g., a mutation. In some embodiments, a break is positioned within the region desired to be altered, e.g., within a region defined by at least two mutant nucleotides. In some embodiments, a break is positioned immediately adjacent to the region desired to be altered, e.g., immediately upstream or downstream of a mutation.</p><p id="p-0887" num="1009">In an embodiment, a single strand break is accompanied by an additional single strand break, positioned by a second gRNA molecule, as discussed below. For example, the targeting domains are configured such that a cleavage event, e.g., the two single strand breaks, are positioned within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 350, 400 or 500 nucleotides of a target position. In an embodiment, the first and second gRNA molecules are configured such, that when guiding a Cas9 nickase, a single strand break will be accompanied by an additional single strand break, positioned by a second gRNA, sufficiently close to one another to result in alteration of the desired region. In an embodiment, the first and second gRNA molecules are configured such that a single strand break positioned by said second gRNA is within 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 nucleotides of the break positioned by said first gRNA molecule, e.g., when the Cas9 is a nickase. In an embodiment, the two gRNA molecules are configured to position cuts at the same position, or within a few nucleotides of one another, on different strands, e.g., essentially mimicking a double strand break.</p><p id="p-0888" num="1010">In an embodiment, in which a gRNA (unimolecular (or chimeric) or modular gRNA) and Cas9 nuclease induce a double strand break for the purpose of inducing HDR-mediated correction, the cleavage site is between 0-200 bp (e.g., 0-175, 0 to 150, 0 to 125, 0 to 100, 0 to 75, 0 to 50, 0 to 25, 25 to 200, 25 to 175, 25 to 150, 25 to 125, 25 to 100, 25 to 75, 25 to 50, 50 to 200, 50 to 175, 50 to 150, 50 to 125, 50 to 100, 50 to 75, 75 to 200, 75 to 175, 75 to 150, 75 to 125, 75 to 100 bp) away from the target position. In an embodiment, the cleavage site is between 0-100 bp (e.g., 0 to 75, 0 to 50, 0 to 25, 25 to 100, 25 to 75, 25 to 50, 50 to 100, 50 to 75 or 75 to 100 bp) away from the target position.</p><p id="p-0889" num="1011">In embodiments, one can promote HDR by using nickases to generate a break with overhangs. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the single stranded nature of the overhangs can enhance the cell's likelihood of repairing the break by HDR as opposed to, e.g., NHEJ. Specifically, in some embodiments, HDR is promoted by selecting a first gRNA that targets a first nickase to a first target sequence, and a second gRNA that targets a second nickase to a second target sequence which is on the opposite DNA strand from the first target sequence and offset from the first nick.</p><p id="p-0890" num="1012">In an embodiment, the targeting domain of a gRNA molecule is configured to position a cleavage event sufficiently far from a preselected nucleotide, e.g., the nucleotide of a coding region, such that the nucleotide is not altered. In an embodiment, the targeting domain of a gRNA molecule is configured to position an intronic cleavage event sufficiently far from an intron/exon border, or naturally occurring splice signal, to avoid alteration of the exonic sequence or unwanted splicing events.

For example, when two gRNAs are used to position two double stranded breaks, a single Cas9 nuclease may be used to create both double stranded breaks. When two or more gRNAs are used to position two or more single stranded breaks (nicks), a single Cas9 nickase may be used to create the two or more nicks. When two or more gRNAs are used to position at least one double stranded break and at least one single stranded break, two Cas9 proteins may be used, e.g., one Cas9 nuclease and one Cas9 nickase. It is contemplated that when two or more Cas9 proteins are used that the two or more Cas9 proteins may be delivered sequentially to control specificity of a double stranded versus a single stranded break at the desired position in the target nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0896" num="1018">In some embodiments, the targeting domain of the first gRNA molecule and the targeting domain of the second gRNA molecules are complementary to opposite strands of the target nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, the gRNA molecule and the second gRNA molecule are configured such that the PAMs are oriented outward.</p><p id="p-0897" num="1019">In certain embodiments, two gRNA are selected to direct Cas9-mediated cleavage at two positions that are a preselected distance from each other. In embodiments, the two points of cleavage are on opposite strands of the target nucleic acid.

In some embodiments, each cleavage event is a nick. In embodiments, the nicks are close enough together that they form a break that is recognized by the double stranded break machinery (as opposed to being recognized by, e.g., the SSBr machinery). In embodiments, the nicks are far enough apart that they create an overhang that is a substrate for HDR, i.e., the placement of the breaks mimics a DNA substrate that has experienced some resection. For instance, in some embodiments the nicks are spaced to create an overhang that is a substrate for processive resection. In some embodiments, the two breaks are spaced within 25-65 nucleotides of each other. The two breaks may be, e.g., about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 or 65 nucleotides of each other. The two breaks may be, e.g., at least about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 or 65 nucleotides of each other.

When choosing a combination, one can take into account that there are nickases having one active RuvC-like domain, and nickases having one active HNH domain. In an embodiment, a RuvC-like domain cleaves the non-complementary strand of the target nucleic acid molecule. In an embodiment, an HNH-like domain cleaves a single stranded complementary domain, e.g., a complementary strand of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule. Generally, if both Cas9 molecules have the same active domain (e.g., both have an active RuvC domain or both have an active HNH domain), one will choose two gRNAs that bind to opposite strands of the target. In more detail, in some embodiments, a first gRNA is complementary with a first strand of the target nucleic acid and binds a nickase having an active RuvC-like domain and causes that nickase to cleave the strand that is non-complementary to that first gRNA, i.e., a second strand of the target nucleic acid; and a second gRNA is complementary with a second strand of the target nucleic acid and binds a nickase having an active RuvC-like domain and causes that nickase to cleave the strand that is non-complementary to that second gRNA, i.e., the first strand of the target nucleic acid. Conversely, in some embodiments, a first gRNA is complementary with a first strand of the target nucleic acid and binds a nickase having an active HNH domain and causes that nickase to cleave the strand that is complementary to that first gRNA, i.e., a first strand of the target nucleic acid; and a second gRNA is complementary with a second strand of the target nucleic acid and binds a nickase having an active HNH domain and causes that nickase to cleave the strand that is complementary to that second gRNA, i.e., the second strand of the target nucleic acid. In another arrangement, if one Cas9 molecule has an active RuvC-like domain and the other Cas9 molecule has an active HNH domain, the gRNAs for both Cas9 molecules can be complementary to the same strand of the target nucleic acid, so that the Cas9 molecule with the active RuvC-like domain will cleave the non-complementary strand and the Cas9 molecule with the HNH domain will cleave the complementary strand, resulting in a double stranded break.</p><p id="p-0903" num="1025">Length of the Homology Arms of the Donor Template</p><p id="p-0904" num="1026">The homology arm should extend at least as far as the region in which end resection may occur, e.g., in order to allow the resected single stranded overhang to find a complementary region within the donor template.

In an embodiment, a homology arm does not extend into repeated elements, e.g., ALU repeats or LINE repeats.</p><p id="p-0905" num="1027">Exemplary homology arm lengths include at least 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 nucleotides.

For example, the target position can be a modified Cas9 molecule cleavage of the target nucleic acid and template nucleic acid directed modification, e.g., correction, of the target position. In an embodiment, a target position can be a site between two nucleotides, e.g., adjacent nucleotides, on the target nucleic acid into which one or more nucleotides is added. The target position may comprise one or more nucleotides that are altered, e.g., corrected, by a template nucleic acid. In an embodiment, the target position is within a target sequence (e.g., the sequence to which the gRNA binds).

Longer homology arms are also contemplated for ssODNs as improvements in oligonucleotide synthesis continue to be made. In some embodiments, a longer homology arm is made by a method other than chemical synthesis, e.g., by denaturing a long double stranded nucleic acid and purifying one of the strands, e.g., by affinity for a strand-specific sequence anchored to a solid substrate.</p><p id="p-0921" num="1043">While not wishing to be bound by theory, in some embodiments alt-HDR proceeds more efficiently when the template nucleic acid has extended homology 5&#x2032; to the nick (i.e., in the 5&#x2032; direction of the nicked strand). Accordingly, in some embodiments, the template nucleic acid has a longer homology arm and a shorter homology arm, wherein the longer homology arm can anneal 5&#x2032; of the nick. In some embodiments, the arm that can anneal 5&#x2032; to the nick is at least 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 nucleotides from the nick or the 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; end of the replacement sequence.

Depending on whether a ssDNA template can anneal to the intact strand or the nicked strand, the homology arm that anneals 5&#x2032; to the nick may be at the 5&#x2032; end of the ssDNA template or the 3&#x2032; end of the ssDNA template, respectively.</p><p id="p-0922" num="1044">Similarly, in some embodiments, the template nucleic acid has a 5&#x2032; homology arm, a replacement sequence, and a 3&#x2032; homology arm, such that the template nucleic acid has extended homology to the 5&#x2032; of the nick. For example, the 5&#x2032; homology arm and 3&#x2032; homology arm may be substantially the same length, but the replacement sequence may extend farther 5&#x2032; of the nick than 3&#x2032; of the nick.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, in some embodiments alt-HDR proceeds more efficiently when the template nucleic acid is centered on the nick. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the template nucleic acid has two homology arms that are essentially the same size. For instance, the first homology arm of a template nucleic acid may have a length that is within 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% of the second homology arm of the template nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0923" num="1045">Similarly, in some embodiments, the template nucleic acid has a 5&#x2032; homology arm, a replacement sequence, and a 3&#x2032; homology arm, such that the template nucleic acid extends substantially the same distance on either side of the nick.

For example, the replacement sequence may extend further 5&#x2032; from the nick than it does 3&#x2032; of the nick, but the homology arm 5&#x2032; of the nick is shorter than the homology arm 3&#x2032; of the nick, to compensate. The converse is also possible, e.g., that the replacement sequence may extend further 3&#x2032; from the nick than it does 5&#x2032; of the nick, but the homology arm 3&#x2032; of the nick is shorter than the homology arm 5&#x2032; of the nick, to compensate.</p><p id="p-0924" num="1046">Exemplary Arrangements of Linear Nucleic Acid Template Systems</p><p id="p-0925" num="1047">In an embodiment, the nucleic acid template system is double stranded.

Repeat sequences utilized by the SSA pathway are generally greater than 30 nucleotides in length. Resection at the break ends occurs to reveal repeat sequences on both strands of the target nucleic acid. After resection, single strand overhangs containing the repeat sequences are coated with RPA protein to prevent the repeats sequences from inappropriate annealing, e.g., to themselves. RAD52 binds to and each of the repeat sequences on the overhangs and aligns the sequences to enable the annealing of the complementary repeat sequences. After annealing, the single-strand flaps of the overhangs are cleaved. New DNA synthesis fills in any gaps, and ligation restores the DNA duplex. As a result of the processing, the DNA sequence between the two repeats is deleted. The length of the deletion can depend on many factors including the location of the two repeats utilized, and the pathway or processivity of the resection.</p><p id="p-0961" num="1077">In contrast to HDR pathways, SSA does not require a template nucleic acid to alter or correct a target nucleic acid sequence. Instead, the complementary repeat sequence is utilized.</p><p id="p-0962" num="1078">V.5 Other DNA Repair Pathways</p><p id="p-0963" num="1079">SSBR (Single Strand Break Repair)</p><p id="p-0964" num="1080">Single-stranded breaks (SSB) in the genome are repaired by the SSBR pathway, which is a distinct mechanism from the DSB repair mechanisms discussed above. The SSBR pathway has four major stages: SSB detection, DNA end processing, DNA gap filling, and DNA ligation. A more detailed explanation is given in Caldecott, Nature Reviews Genetics 9, 619-631 (August 2008), and a summary is given here.</p><p id="p-0965" num="1081">In the first stage, when a SSB forms, PARP1 and/or PARP2 recognize the break and recruit repair machinery. The binding and activity of PARP1 at DNA breaks is transient and it seems to accelerate SSBr by promoting the focal accumulation or stability of SSBr protein complexes at the lesion. Arguably the most important of these SSBr proteins is XRCC1, which functions as a molecular scaffold that interacts with, stabilizes, and stimulates multiple enzymatic components of the SSBr process including the protein responsible for cleaning the DNA 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; ends. For instance, XRCC1 interacts with several proteins (DNA polymerase beta, PNK, and three nucleases, APE1, APTX, and APLF) that promote end processing. APE1 has endonuclease activity. APLF exhibits endonuclease and 3&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; exonuclease activities. APTX has endonuclease and 3&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; exonuclease activity.</p><p id="p-0966" num="1082">This end processing is an important stage of SSBR since the 3&#x2032;- and/or 5&#x2032;-termini of most, if not all, SSBs are &#x2018;damaged&#x2019;. End processing generally involves restoring a damaged 3&#x2032;-end to a hydroxylated state and and/or a damaged 5&#x2032; end to a phosphate moiety, so that the ends become ligation-competent. Enzymes that can process damaged 3&#x2032; termini include PNKP, APE1, and TDP1. Enzymes that can process damaged 5&#x2032; termini include PNKP, DNA polymerase beta, and APTX. LIG3 (DNA ligase III) can also participate in end processing. Once the ends are cleaned, gap filling can occur.</p><p id="p-0967" num="1083">At the DNA gap filling stage, the proteins typically present are PARP1, DNA polymerase beta, XRCC1, FEN1 (flap endonculease 1), DNA polymerase delta/epsilon, PCNA, and LIG1. There are two ways of gap filling, the short patch repair and the long patch repair. Short patch repair involves the insertion of a single nucleotide that is missing. At some SSBs, &#x201c;gap filling&#x201d; might continue displacing two or more nucleotides (displacement of up to 12 bases have been reported). FEN1 is an endonuclease that removes the displaced 5-&#x2032;-residues. Multiple DNA polymerases, including Pol &#x3b2;, are involved in the repair of SSBs, with the choice of DNA polymerase influenced by the source and type of SSB.</p><p id="p-0968" num="1084">In the fourth stage, a DNA ligase such as LIG1 (Ligase I) or LIG3 (Ligase III) catalyzes joining of the ends. Short patch repair uses Ligase III and long patch repair uses Ligase I.</p><p id="p-0969" num="1085">Sometimes, SSBR is replication-coupled. This pathway can involve one or more of CtIP, MRN, ERCC1, and FEN1. Additional factors that may promote SSBR include: aPARP, PARP1, PARP2, PARG, XRCC1, DNA polymerase b, DNA polymerase d, DNA polymerase e, PCNA, LIG1, PNK, PNKP, APE1, APTX, APLF, TDP1, LIG3, FEN1, CtIP, MRN, and ERCC1.</p><p id="p-0970" num="1086">MMR (Mismatch Repair)</p><p id="p-0971" num="1087">Cells contain three excision repair pathways: MMR, BER, and NER. The excision repair pathways hace a common feature in that they typically recognize a lesion on one strand of the DNA, then exo/endonucleaseases remove the lesion and leave a 1-30 nucleotide gap that is sub-sequentially filled in by DNA polymerase and finally sealed with ligase. A more complete picture is given in Li, Cell Research (2008) 18:85-98, and a summary is provided here.</p><p id="p-0972" num="1088">Mismatch repair (MMR) operates on mispaired DNA bases.</p><p id="p-0973" num="1089">The MSH2/6 or MSH2/3 complexes both have ATPases activity that plays an important role in mismatch recognition and the initiation of repair. MSH2/6 preferentially recognizes base-base mismatches and identifies mispairs of 1 or 2 nucleotides, while MSH2/3 preferentially recognizes larger ID mispairs.</p><p id="p-0974" num="1090">hMLH1 heterodimerizes with hPMS2 to form hMutLa which possesses an ATPase activity and is important for multiple steps of MMR. It possesses a PCNA/replication factor C (RFC)-dependent endonuclease activity which plays an important role in 3&#x2032; nick-directed MMR involving EXO1. (EXO1 is a participant in both HR and MMR.) It regulates termination of mismatch-provoked excision. Ligase I is the relevant ligase for this pathway. Additional factors that may promote MMR include: EXO1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, MLH3, DNA Pol d, RPA, HMGB 1, RFC, and DNA ligase I.</p><p id="p-0975" num="1091">Base Excision Repair (BER)</p><p id="p-0976" num="1092">The base excision repair (BER) pathway is active throughout the cell cycle; it is responsible primarily for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome. In contrast, the related Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway (discussed in the next section) repairs bulky helix-distorting lesions. A more detailed explanation is given in Caldecott, Nature Reviews Genetics 9, 619-631 (August 2008), and a summary is given here.</p><p id="p-0977" num="1093">Upon DNA base damage, base excision repair (BER) is initiated and the process can be simplified into five major steps: (a) removal of the damaged DNA base; (b) incision of the subsequent a basic site; (c) clean-up of the DNA ends; (d) insertion of the correct nucleotide into the repair gap; and (e) ligation of the remaining nick in the DNA backbone. These last steps are similar to the SSBR.</p><p id="p-0978" num="1094">In the first step, a damage-specific DNA glycosylase excises the damaged base through cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond linking the base to the sugar phosphate backbone. Then AP endonuclease-1 (APE1) or bifunctional DNA glycosylases with an associated lyase activity incised the phosphodiester backbone to create a DNA single strand break (SSB). The third step of BER involves cleaning-up of the DNA ends. The fourth step in BER is conducted by Pol &#x3b2; that adds a new complementary nucleotide into the repair gap and in the final step XRCC1/Ligase III seals the remaining nick in the DNA backbone. This completes the short-patch BER pathway in which the majority (&#x2dc;80%) of damaged DNA bases are repaired. However, if the 5&#x2032;-ends in step 3 are resistant to end processing activity, following one nucleotide insertion by Pol &#x3b2; there is then a polymerase switch to the replicative DNA polymerases, Pol &#x3b4;/&#x3b5;, which then add &#x2dc;2-8 more nucleotides into the DNA repair gap. This creates a 5&#x2032;-flap structure, which is recognized and excised by flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) in association with the processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). DNA ligase I then seals the remaining nick in the DNA backbone and completes long-patch BER. Additional factors that may promote the BER pathway include: DNA glycosylase, APE1, Polb, Pold, Pole, XRCC1, Ligase III, FEN-1, PCNA, RECQL4, WRN, MYH, PNKP, and APTX.</p><p id="p-0979" num="1095">Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)</p><p id="p-0980" num="1096">Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important excision mechanism that removes bulky helix-distorting lesions from DNA. Additional details about NER are given in Marteijn et al., Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 15, 465-481 (2014), and a summary is given here. NER a broad pathway encompassing two smaller pathways: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled repair NER (TC-NER). GG-NER and TC-NER use different factors for recognizing DNA damage. However, they utilize the same machinery for lesion incision, repair, and ligation.</p><p id="p-0981" num="1097">Once damage is recognized, the cell removes a short single-stranded DNA segment that contains the lesion. Endonucleases XPF/ERCC1 and XPG (encoded by ERCC5) remove the lesion by cutting the damaged strand on either side of the lesion, resulting in a single-strand gap of 22-30 nucleotides. Next, the cell performs DNA gap filling synthesis and ligation. Involved in this process are: PCNA, RFC, DNA Pol S, DNA Pol c or DNA Pol x, and DNA ligase I or XRCC1/Ligase III. Replicating cells tend to use DNA pol c and DNA ligase I, while non-replicating cells tend to use DNA Pol S, DNA Pol x, and the XRCC1/Ligase III complex to perform the ligation step.</p><p id="p-0982" num="1098">NER can involve the following factors: XPA-G, POLH, XPF, ERCC1, XPA-G, and LIG1. Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) can involve the following factors: CSA, CSB, XPB, XPD, XPG, ERCC1, and TTDA. Additional factors that may promote the NER repair pathway include XPA-G, POLH, XPF, ERCC1, XPA-G, LIG1, CSA, CSB, XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG, TTDA, UVSSA, USP7, CETN2, RAD23B, UV-DDB, CAK subcomplex, RPA, and PCNA.</p><p id="p-0983" num="1099">Interstrand Crosslink (ICL)</p><p id="p-0984" num="1100">A dedicated pathway called the ICL repair pathway repairs interstrand crosslinks. Interstrand crosslinks, or covalent crosslinks between bases in different DNA strand, can occur during replication or transcription. ICL repair involves the coordination of multiple repair processes, in particular, nucleolytic activity, translesion synthesis (TLS), and HDR. Nucleases are recruited to excise the ICL on either side of the crosslinked bases, while TLS and HDR are coordinated to repair the cut strands. ICL repair can involve the following factors: endonucleases, e.g., XPF and RAD51C, endonucleases such as RAD51, translesion polymerases, e.g., DNA polymerase zeta and Rev1), and the Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins, e.g., FancJ.</p><p id="p-0985" num="1101">Other Pathways</p><p id="p-0986" num="1102">Several other DNA repair pathways exist in mammals.</p><p id="p-0987" num="1103">Translesion

Typically, the approach consists of the following steps: 1) obtaining leukocytes from the subject by apheresis; 2) selecting/enriching for T cells; 3) activating the T cells by cytokine treatment; 4) introducing cloned T cell receptor (TCR) genes or a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene by retroviral transduction, lentiviral transduction or electroporation; 5) expanding the T cells by cytokine treatment; 6) conditioning the subject, usually by lymphodepletion; and 7) infusion of the engineered T cells into the subject.</p><p id="p-1158" num="1289">Sources of cloned TCR genes (TRAC and TRBC) include rare T cell populations isolated from individuals with particular malignancies and T cell clones isolated from T cell receptor-humanized mice immunized with specific tumor antigens or tumor cells. Following adoptive transfer, TCR-engineered T cells recognize their cognate antigen peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (WIC) proteins on the tumor cell surface. Antigen engagement stimulates signal transduction pathways leading to T cell activation and proliferation. Stimulated T cells then mount a cytotoxic anti-tumor cell response, typically involving a secreted complex comprising Granzyme B, perforin and granulysin, inducing tumor cell apoptosis.</p><p id="p-1159" num="1290">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genes encode artificial T cell receptors comprising an extra-cellular tumor antigen binding domain, typically derived from the single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) domain of a monoclonal antibody, fused via hinge and transmembrane domains to a cytoplasmic effector domain. The effector domain is typically derived from the CD3-zeta chain of the T cell co-receptor complex, and can also include domains derived from CD28 and/or CD137 receptor proteins. The CAR extra-cellular domain binds the tumor antigen in an WIC-independent manner leading to T cell activation and proliferation, culminating in cytotoxic anti-tumor activity as described for TCR engineered T cells.</p><p id="p-1160" num="1291">To date, at least 15 different tumor antigens have been targeted in clinical trials of engineered T cells. In several trials, anti-tumor activity has been reported. The greatest success has been achieved in hematologic malignancies. For example, adoptive transfer of CAR-T cells engineered to target the B cell antigen, CD19, led to multiple partial and complete responses in subjects with lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. In contrast, trials targeting other tumor types, especially solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, sarcoma and prostate cancer, have been less successful. In many of these trials, very few patients experienced objective responses. Thus, there is a need to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of adoptively transferred engineered T cells.</p><p id="p-1161" num="1292">In order for engineered T cells to mount an effective anti-tumor response they need to: 1) proliferate adequately following transfer to the subject to provide a sufficient number of specific tumor-targeting T cells; 2) survive in the subject for a length of time sufficient to maintain the required anti-tumor activity; and 3) evade the influence of suppressive factors produced by immune cells, tumor cells and other cells in the tumor environment so that the engineered T cells maintain a functional anti-tumor phenotype. Insufficient proliferation and/or survival, as well as susceptibility to inhibitory factors, can contribute to lack of efficacy of engineered T cells in subjects suffering from cancer. The methods and compositions disclosed herein address these issues in order to improve efficacy of engineered T cells as a cancer therapeutic modality.</p><p id="p-1162" num="1293">In an embodiment, compositions and methods described herein can be used to affect proliferation of engineered T cells by altering the CBLB gene. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is considered that reduced or absent expression of Casitas B-lineage lymphoma b protein (encoded by CBLB) reduces the requirement for exogenous interleukin signaling to promote proliferation of engineered T cells following transfer to the subject (Stromnes, I.

This approach, therefore, could be used to generate &#x201c;off the shelf&#x201d; T cells (Torikai et al., 2012 Blood 119, 5697-5705). Also, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is considered that reduced or absent expression of the TRAC and/or TRBC gene will reduce or eliminate mis-pairing of endogenous T cell receptors with exogenously introduced engineered T cell receptors, thus improving therapeutic efficacy (Provasi et al., 2012, Nature Medicine 18, 807-815).</p><p id="p-1169" num="1300">In an embodiment, compositions and methods described herein can be used to decrease one or more of FAS, BID, CTLA4, PDCD1, CBLB, PTPN6, TRAC and TRBC genes to improve treatment of cancer immunotherapy using engineered T cells.</p><p id="p-1170" num="1301">Disclosed herein are approaches to treat cancer via immunotherapy, using the compositions and methods described herein.</p><p id="p-1171" num="1302">In one approach, one or more of the FAS, BID, CTLA4, PDCD1, CBLB, PTPN6, TRAC and TRBC genes are targeted as a targeted knockout or knockdown, e.g., to affect T cell proliferation, survival and/or function.

In another embodiment, one or more genes in a cell may be altered by cleavage with a Cas9 nuclease and one or more genes in the same cell may be altered by cleavage with a Cas9 nickase. When two or more Cas9 proteins are used to cut a target nucleic acid, e.g., different genes in a cell, the Cas9 proteins may be from different bacterial species. For example, one or more genes in a cell may be altered by cleavage with a Cas9 protein from one bacterial species, and one or more genes in the same cell may be altered by cleavage with a Cas9 protein from a different bacterial species.

In the United States, more than 1 million people are infected with the virus. Worldwide, approximately 30-40 million people are infected.</p><p id="p-1303" num="1434">HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that preferentially infects CD4 cells. The virus binds to receptors on the surface of CD4+ cells to enter and infect these cells. This binding and infection step is vital to the pathogenesis of HIV. The virus attaches to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface via its own surface glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41. These proteins are made from the cleavage product of gp160. Gp120 binds to a CD4 receptor and must also bind to another coreceptor in order for the virus to enter the host cell. In macrophage-(M-tropic) viruses, the coreceptor is CCR5 occassionaly referred to as the CCR5 receptor. In thymic-(T-tropic) viruses, the coreceptor is CXCR4. M-tropic virus is found most commonly in the early stages of HIV infection.</p><p id="p-1304" num="1435">There are two types of HIV-HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the predominant global form and is a more virulent strain of the virus. HIV-2 has lower rates of infection and, at present, predominantly affects populations in West Africa. HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual exposure, although the sharing of needles in intravenous drug use is another mode of transmission.</p><p id="p-1305" num="1436">As HIV progresses, the virus infects CD4 cells and a subject's CD4 counts fall. With declining CD4 counts, a subject is subject to increasing risk of opportunistic infections (OI). Severely declining CD4 counts are associated with a very high likelihood of OIs, specific cancers (such as Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma) and wasting syndrome. Normal CD4 counts are between 600-1200 cells/microliter.</p><p id="p-1306" num="1437">Untreated HIV is a chronic, progressive disease that leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death in the vast majority of subjects. Diagnosis of AIDS is made based on infection with a variety of opportunistic pathogens, presence of certain cancers and/or CD4 counts below 200 cells/&#x3bc;L.</p><p id="p-1307" num="1438">HIV was untreatable and invariably led to death until the late 1980's. Since then, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically slowed the course of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the use of three or more agents in combination to slow HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is indicated in a subject whose CD4 counts has dropped below 500 cells/&#x3bc;L. Viral load is the most common measurement of the efficacy of HIV treatment and disease progression. Viral load measures the amount of HIV RNA present in the blood.</p><p id="p-1308" num="1439">Treatment with HAART has significantly altered the life expectancy of those infected with HIV. A subject in the developed world who maintains their HAART regimen can expect to live into their 60's and possibly 70's. However, HAART regimens are associated with significant, long term side effects. First, the dosing regimens are complex and associated with strict food requirements. Compliance rates with dosing can be lower than 50% in some populations in the United States. In addition, there are significant toxicities associated with HAART treatment, including diabetes, nausea, malaise, sleep disturbances. A subject who does not adhere to dosing requirements of HAART therapy may have return of viral load in their blood and are at risk for progression to disease and its associated complications.</p><p id="p-1309" num="1440">Methods and compositions described herein provide for a therapy, e.g., a one-time therapy, or a multi-dose therapy, that prevents or treats HIV infection and/or AIDS. In an embodiment, a disclosed therapy prevents the entry of HIV into CD4 cells of a subject who is already infected. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that knocking out CCR5 on CD4 cells, renders the HIV virus unable to enter CD4 cells. Viral entry into CD4 cells requires interaction of the viral glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 with both the CD4 receptor and the CCR5 coreceptor. Once a functional CCR5 viral receptor has been eliminated from the surface of the CD4 cells, the virus is prevented from binding and entering the host CD4 cells. In an embodiment, the disease does not progress.</p><p id="p-1310" num="1441">While not wishing to be bound by theory, subjects with naturally occurring CCR5 receptor mutations who have delayed HIV progression may confer protection by the mechanism of action described herein. Subjects with a specific deletion in the CCR5 gene (e.g., the delta 32 deletion) have been shown to have much higher likelihood of being long-term non-progressors (meaning they did not require HAART and their HIV infection did not progress). (See, e.g., Stewart G J et al., 1997 The Australian Long-Term Non-Progressor Study Group. Aids.11:1833-1838.) In addition, a subject who was CCR5+(had a wild type CCR5 receptor) and infected with HIV underwent a bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid lymphoma. (See, e.g., Hutter G et al., 2009N E<smallcaps>NGL </smallcaps>J M<smallcaps>ED</smallcaps>.360:692-698.) The bone marrow transplant (BMT) was from a subject homozygous for a CCR5 delta 32 deletion. Following BMT, the subject did not have progression of HIV and did not require treatment with ART. These subjects offer evidence for the fact that induction of a protective mutation of the CCR5 gene or a knockout of the CCR5 gene prevents, delays or diminishes the ability of HIV to infect the subject. Mutation or deletion of the CCR5 gene should therefore reduce the progression, virulence and pathology of HIV.

In an embodiment, methods and compositions discussed can prevent HIV infection and/or prevent the ability for HIV to enter CD4 cells of subjects who are already infected. While not wishing to be bound by theory, by knocking out CCR5 in CD4 cells or inducing a protective mutation (such as a CCR5 delta 32 mutation), entry of the HIV virus into CD4 cells is prevented. Viral entry into CD4 cells requires interaction of the viral glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 with both the CD4 receptor and CCR5, which acts as a co-receptor. If CCR5 is not present on the surface of the CD4 cells, the virus cannot bind and enter the host CD4 cells.

One approach to treat or prevent SCD is to repair (i.e., correct) one or more mutations in the HBB gene by HDR. In this approach, mutant HBB allele(s) are corrected and restored to wild type state. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that correction of the glutamic acid to valine substitution at amino acid 6 in the beta-globin gene restores wild type beta-globin production within erythroid cells. The methods described herein can be performed in all cell types. Beta-globin is expressed in cells of erythroid cell lineage. In an embodiment, an erythroid cell is targeted.</p><p id="p-1401" num="1532">In an embodiment, one HBB allele is repaired in the subject. In another embodiment, both HBB alleles are repaired in the subject. In either situation, the subjects can be cured of disease. As the disease only displays a phenotype when both alleles are mutated, repair of a single allele is adequate for a cure.</p><p id="p-1402" num="1533">In one approach, the BCL11A gene is targeted as a targeted knockout or knockdown, e.g., to increase expression of fetal hemoglobin.</p><p id="p-1403" num="1534">While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is considered that increasing levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in subjects with SCD may ameliorate disease. Fetal hemoglobin can replace beta hemoglobin in the hemoglobin complex, form adequate tetramers with alpha hemoglobin, and effectively carry oxygen to tissues. Subjects with SCD who express higher levels of fetal hemoglobin have been found to have a less severe phenotype. Hydroxyurea, often used in the treatment of SCD, may exert its mechanism of action via increasing levels of HbF production.</p><p id="p-1404" num="1535">In an embodiment, knockout or knockdown of the BCL11A gene increases fetal hemoglobin levels in SCD subjects and improves phenotype and/or reduces or prevents disease progression. BCL11A is a zinc-finger repressor that is involved in the regulation of fetal hemoglobin and acts to repress the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin. Knockout of the BCL11A gene in erythroid cells induces increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis and increased HbF can result in more effective oxygen carrying capacity in subjects with SCD (HbF will form tetramers with hemoglobin alpha).</p><p id="p-1405" num="1536">In an embodiment, the BCL11A knockout or knockdown is targeted specifically to cells of the erythroid lineage. BCL11A knockout in erythroid cells has been found in in vitro studies to have no effect on erythroid growth, maturation and function. In an embodiment, erythroid cells are preferentially targeted, e.g., at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the targeted cells are erythroid cells. For example, if cells are treated ex vivo and returned to the subject, erythroid cells are preferentially modified.</p><p id="p-1406" num="1537">In an embodiment, the methods described herein result in increased fetal hemoglobin synthesis in SCD subjects, thereby improving disease phenotype in subjects with SCD. For example, subjects with SCD will suffer from less severe anemia and will need fewer blood transfusions. They will therefore have fewer complications arising from transfusions and chelation therapy. In an embodiment, the method described herein increases fetal hemoglobin synthesis and improves the oxygen carrying capacity of erythroid cells. For example, subjects are expected to demonstrate decreased rates of extramedullary erythropoiesis and decreased erythroid hypertrophy within the bone marrow. In an embodiment, the method described herein results in reduction of bone fractures, bone abnormalities, splenomegaly, and thrombosis.</p><p id="p-1407" num="1538">Knockdown or knockout of one or both BCL11A alleles may be performed prior to disease onset or after disease onset, but preferably early in the disease course.</p><p id="p-1408" num="1539">In an embodiment, the method comprises initiating treatment of a subject prior to disease onset.

One such gene is BCL11A. It plays a role in the regulation of &#x3b3; globin expression. It was first identified because of its role in lymphocyte development. BCL11A encodes a zinc finger protein that is thought to be involved in the stage specific regulation of &#x3b3; globin expression. BCL11A is expressed in adult erythroid precursor cells and down-regulation of its expression leads to an increase in &#x3b3; globin expression. In addition, it appears that the splicing of the BCL11A mRNA is developmentally regulated. In embryonic cells, it appears that the shorter BCL11A mRNA variants, known as BCL11A-S and BCL11A-XS are primary expressed, while in adult cells, the longer BCL11A-L and BCL11A-XL mRNA variants are predominantly expressed. See, Sankaran et al (2008) Science 322 p. 1839. The BCL11A protein appears to interact with the &#x3b2; globin locus to alter its conformation and thus its expression at different developmental stages. Thus, if BCL11A expression is altered e.g., disrupted (e.g., reduced or eliminated), it results in the elevation of &#x3b3; globin and HbF production.</p><p id="p-1431" num="1562">Disclosed herein are methods for altering the SCD target position in the BCL11A gene.</p><p id="p-1432" num="1563">Altering the SCD target position is achieved, e.g., by:</p><p id="p-1433" num="1564">(1) knocking out the BCL11A gene:<ul id="ul0068" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0068-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0069" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0069-0001" num="1565">(a) insertion or deletion (e.g., NHEJ-mediated insertion or deletion) of one or more nucleotides in close proximity to or within the early coding region of the BCL11A gene, or</li>        <li id="ul0069-0002" num="1566">(b) deletion (e.g., NHEJ-mediated deletion) of a genomic sequence including the erythroid enhancer of the BCL11A gene, or</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-1434" num="1567">(2) knocking down the BCL11A gene mediated by enzymatically inactive Cas9 (eiCas9) or an eiCas9-fusion protein by targeting the promoter region of the gene.</p><p id="p-1435" num="1568">All approaches give rise to alteration of the BCL11A gene.</p><p id="p-1436" num="1569">In one embodiment, methods described herein introduce one or more breaks near the early coding region in at least one allele of the BCL11A gene.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that NHEJ-mediated repair of the break(s) allows for the NHEJ-mediated introduction of an indel in close proximity to within the early coding region of the SCD target knockout position.</p><p id="p-1439" num="1572">In an embodiment, the targeting domain of the gRNA molecule is configured to provide a cleavage event, e.g., a double strand break or a single strand break, sufficiently close to the early coding region in the BCL11A gene to allow alteration, e.g., alteration associated with NHEJ in the BCL11A gene.

In an embodiment, the first and second gRNA molecules are configured such, that when guiding a Cas9 nickase, a single strand break will be accompanied by an additional single strand break, positioned by a second gRNA, sufficiently close to one another to result in alteration of the early coding region in the BCL11A gene in the BCL11A gene.

SCD is an inherited hematologic disease.</p><p id="p-1649" num="1791">In healthy individuals, two beta-globin molecules pair with two alpha-globin molecules to form normal hemoglobin (Hb). In SCD, mutations in the beta-globin (HBB) gene, e.g., a point mutation (GAG&#x2192;GTG) that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at amino acid position 6 of the beta-globin molecule, cause production of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). HbS is more likely to polymerize and leads to the characteristic sickle shaped red blood cells (RBCs). Sickle shaped RBCs give rise to multiple manifestations of disease, such as, anemia, sickle cell crises, vaso-occlusive crises, aplastic crises and acute chest syndrome. Alpha-globin can also pair with fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which significantly moderates the severe anemia and other symptoms of SCD.

Methods and compositions discussed herein can be used to treat or prevent SCD by altering the BCL11A gene (also known as B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11A, BCL11A-L, BCL11A-S, BCL11A XL, CTIP1, HBFQTL5 and ZNF). BCL11A encodes a zinc-finger protein that is involved in the regulation of globin gene expression. By altering the BCL11A gene (e.g., one or both alleles of the BCL11A gene), the levels of gamma globin can be increased. Gamma globin can replace beta globin in the hemoglobin complex and effectively carry oxygen to tissues, thereby ameliorating SCD disease phenotypes.</p><p id="p-1651" num="1793">In one aspect, methods and compositions discussed herein, provide for the correction of the underlying genetic cause of SCD, e.g., the correction of a mutation at a target position in the HBB gene, e.g., correction of a mutation at amino acid position 6, e.g., an E6V substitution in the HBB gene.</p><p id="p-1652" num="1794">Mutations in the HBB gene (also known as beta globin, CD113t-C and HBD) have been shown to cause SCD.

Fetal hemoglobin can replace beta hemoglobin in the hemoglobin complex, form adequate tetramers with alpha hemoglobin, and effectively carry oxygen to tissues. Subjects with beta-thalassemia who express higher levels of fetal hemoglobin have been found to have a less severe phenotype. Hydroxyurea, often used in the treatment of beta-thalassemia, may exert its mechanism of action via increasing levels of HbF production.</p><p id="p-1763" num="1905">In an embodiment, knockout or knockdown of the BCL11A gene increases fetal hemoglobin levels in beta-thalassemia subjects and improves phenotype and/or reduces or prevents disease progression. BCL11A is a zinc-finger repressor that is involved in the regulation of fetal hemoglobin and acts to repress the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin. Knockout of the BCL11A gene in erythroid cells induces increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis and increased HbF can result in more effective oxygen carrying capacity in subjects with beta-thalassemia (HbF will form tetramers with hemoglobin alpha).</p><p id="p-1764" num="1906">In an embodiment, the BCL11A knockout or knockdown is targeted specifically to cells of the erythroid lineage. BCL11A knockout in erythroid cells has been found in in vitro studies to have no effect on erythroid growth, maturation and function. In an embodiment, erythroid cells are preferentially targeted, e.g., at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% of the targeted cells are erythroid cells. For example, if cells are treated ex vivo and returned to the subject, erythroid cells are preferentially modified.</p><p id="p-1765" num="1907">In an embodiment, the methods described herein result in increased fetal hemoglobin synthesis in beta thalassemia subjects, thereby improving disease phenotype in subjects with BT. For example, subjects with beta thalassemia major will suffer from less severe anemia and will need fewer blood transfusions. They will therefore have fewer complications arising from transfusions and chelation therapy. In an embodiment, the method described herein increases fetal hemoglobin synthesis and improves the oxygen carrying capacity of erythroid cells. For example, subjects are expected to demonstrate decreased rates of extramedullary erythropoiesis and decreased erythroid hypertrophy within the bone marrow. In an embodiment, the method described herein results in reduction of bone fractures, bone abnormalities, splenomegaly, and thrombosis.</p><p id="p-1766" num="1908">Knockdown or knockout of one or both BCL11A alleles may be performed prior to disease onset or after disease onset, but preferably early in the disease course.</p><p id="p-1767" num="1909">In an embodiment, the method comprises initiating treatment of a subject prior to disease onset.

One such gene is BCL11A. It plays a role in the regulation of &#x3b3; globin expression. It was first identified because of its role in lymphocyte development. BCL11A encodes a zinc finger protein that is thought to be involved in the stage specific regulation of &#x3b3; globin expression. BCL11A is expressed in adult erythroid precursor cells and down-regulation of its expression leads to an increase in &#x3b3; globin expression. In addition, it appears that the splicing of the BCL11A mRNA is developmentally regulated. In embryonic cells, it appears that the shorter BCL11A mRNA variants, known as BCL11A-S and BCL11A-XS are primary expressed, while in adult cells, the longer BCL11A-L and BCL11A-XL mRNA variants are predominantly expressed. See, Sankaran et al (2008) Science 322 p. 1839. The BCL11A protein appears to interact with the &#x3b2; globin locus to alter its conformation and thus its expression at different developmental stages. Thus, if BCL11A expression is altered e.g., disrupted (e.g., reduced or eliminated), it results in the elevation of &#x3b3; globin and HbF production.</p><p id="p-1780" num="1922">Disclosed herein are methods for altering the BT target position in the BCL11A gene.

BCL11A encodes a zinc-finger protein that is involved in the regulation of globin gene expression. By altering the BCL11A gene (e.g., one or both alleles of the BCL11A gene), the levels of gamma globin can be increased. Gamma globin can replace beta globin in the hemoglobin complex and effectively carry oxygen to tissues, thereby ameliorating BT disease phenotypes.</p><p id="p-1997" num="2150">In one aspect, methods and compositions discussed herein may be used to alter the BCL11A gene to treat or prevent BT, by targeting the BCL11A gene, e.g., coding or non-coding regions of the BCL11A gene.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it's believed that deleting the enhancer region (e.g., TSS+52 kb to TSS+64.4 kb) may reduce or eliminate BCL11A expression in erythroid precursors which leads to gamma globin depression while sparing BCL11A expression in nonerythroid lineages. In an embodiment, the method provides an alteration that comprises a deletion of the enhancer region (e.g., a tissue-specific enhancer, e.g., a myleloid enhancer, e.g., an erythroid enhancer) or a protion of the region resulting in disruption of one or more DNase 1-hypersensitivie sites (DHS).

In the United States, more than 1 million people are infected with the virus. Worldwide, approximately 30-40 million people are infected.</p><p id="p-2090" num="2243">HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that preferentially infects CD4 cells. The virus binds to receptors on the surface of CD4+ cells to enter and infect these cells. This binding and infection step is vital to the pathogenesis of HIV. The virus attaches to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface via its own surface glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41. These proteins are made from the cleavage product of gp160. Gp120 binds to a CD4 receptor and must also bind to another coreceptor in order for the virus to enter the host cell. In macrophage-(M-tropic) viruses, the coreceptor is CCR5 occassionaly referred to as the CCR5 receptor. M-tropic virus is found most commonly in the early stages of HIV infection.</p><p id="p-2091" num="2244">There are two types of HIV&#x2014;HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the predominant global form and is a more virulent strain of the virus. HIV-2 has lower rates of infection and, at present, predominantly affects populations in West Africa. HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual exposure, although the sharing of needles in intravenous drug use is another mode of transmission.</p><p id="p-2092" num="2245">As HIV infection progresses, the virus infects CD4 cells and a subject's CD4 counts fall. With declining CD4 counts, a subject is subject to increasing risk of opportunistic infections (01). Severely declining CD4 counts are associated with a very high likelihood of OIs, specific cancers (such as Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma) and wasting syndrome. Normal CD4 counts are between 600-1200 cells/microliter.</p><p id="p-2093" num="2246">Untreated HIV infection is a chronic, progressive disease that leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death in the vast majority of subjects. Diagnosis of AIDS is made based on infection with a variety of opportunistic pathogens, presence of certain cancers and/or CD4 counts below 200 cells/&#x3bc;L.</p><p id="p-2094" num="2247">HIV was untreatable and invariably led to death until the late 1980's. Since then, antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically slowed the course of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the use of three or more agents in combination to slow HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is indicated in a subject whose CD4 counts has dropped below 500 cells/&#x3bc;L. Viral load is the most common measurement of the efficacy of HIV treatment and disease progression. Viral load measures the amount of HIV RNA present in the blood.</p><p id="p-2095" num="2248">Treatment with HAART has significantly altered the life expectancy of those infected with HIV. A subject in the developed world who maintains their HAART regimen can expect to live into their 60's and possibly 70's. However, HAART regimens are associated with significant, long term side effects. First, the dosing regimens are complex and associated with strict food requirements. Compliance rates with dosing can be lower than 50% in some populations in the United States. In addition, there are significant toxicities associated with HAART treatment, including diabetes, nausea, malaise, sleep disturbances. A subject who does not adhere to dosing requirements of HAART therapy may have return of viral load in their blood and are at risk for progression to disease and its associated complications.</p><p id="p-2096" num="2249">In thymic-(T-tropic) viruses, the coreceptor is CXCR4. CXCR4 receptors are expressed by CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, neutrophils and eosinophils. In the later stages of infection, 50-60% of subjects have T-tropic viruses that infect T cells through CXCR4 receptors. Subjects may be infected with M-tropic viruses, T-tropic viruses, and/or M- and T-tropic viruses.</p><p id="p-2097" num="2250">Most initial HIV infections and early stage HIV is due to entry and propogation of M-tropic virus. CCR5-&#x394;32 mutation (also referred to as CCR5 delta 32 mutation) results in a non-functional CCR5 receptor that does not allow M-tropic HIV-1 virus entry. Individuals carrying two copies of the CCR5-&#x394;32 allele are resistant to HIV infection and CCR5-&#x394;32 heterozyous carriers have slow progression of the disease.</p><p id="p-2098" num="2251">CCR5 antagonists (e.g. maraviroc) exist and are used in the treatment of HIV. However, current CCR5 antagonists decrease HIV progression but cannot cure the disease. In addition, there are considerable risks of side effects of these CCR5 antagonists, including severe liver toxicity.</p><p id="p-2099" num="2252">As HIV progresses to later stage, the virus often becomes predominantly T-tropic. In later stage HIV infections, a slight majority of subjects have T-tropic viruses, which infect T cells via CXCR4 coreceptors. CXCR4 receptor tropism is associated with lower CD4 counts, and, often, later stage, more severe disease. There is no known protective mutation in the CXCR4 gene that is equivalent to the CCR5-&#x394;32 mutation.</p><p id="p-2100" num="2253">In spite of considerable advances in the treatment of HIV, there remain considerable needs for agents that could prevent, treat, and eliminate HIV infection or AIDS. Therapies that are free from significant toxicities and involve a single or multi-dose regimen (versus current daily dose regimen for the lifetime of a patient) would be superior to current HIV treatment. A reduction or complete elimination of CCR5, CXCR4, or both CCR5 and CXCR4 gene expression in myeloid and lymphoid cells would prevent HIV infection and progression, and even cure the disease.</p><p id="p-2101" num="2254">Other Embodiments Involving CXCR4 Genes</p><p id="p-2102" num="2255">In an embodiment, methods and compositions discussed herein, allow for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection and AIDS, by gene editing, e.g., using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated methods to alter a CXCR4 gene. Altering the CXCR4 gene herein refers to reducing or eliminating (1) CXCR4 gene expression, (2) CXCR4 protein function, or (3) the level of CXCR4 protein. In an embodiment, altering the CXCR4 gene can be achieved by (1) knocking out the CXCR4 gene or (2) knocking down the CXCR4 gene. The CXCR4 gene is also known as CD184, D2S201E, FB22, HM89, HSY3RR, LAP-3, LAP3, LCR1, LESTR, NPY3R, NPYR, NPYRL, NPYY3R, WHIM, or WHIMS.</p><p id="p-2103" num="2256">In an embodiment, methods and compositions discussed herein, allow for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection and AIDS, by gene editing, e.g., using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated methods to alter each of two genes: the gene for C&#x2014;C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and the gene for chemokine (C&#x2014;X&#x2014;C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4). The alteration, of two or more genes (e.g., CCR5 and CRCX4) in the same cell or cells is referred to herein as &#x201c;multiplexing&#x201d;. Multiplexing constitutes the modification of at least two genes (e.g., CCR5 and CRCX4) in the same cell or cells.</p><p id="p-2104" num="2257">Methods and compositions discussed herein, provide for prevention or reduction of HIV infection and/or prevention or reduction of the ability for HIV to enter host cells, e.g., in subjects who are already infected. Exemplary host cells for HIV include, but are not limited to, CD4 cells, CD8 cells, T cells, B cells, gut associated lymphatic tissue (GALT), macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid progenitor cells, lymphoid progenitor cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, and microglia. Viral entry into the host cells requires interaction of the viral glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 with both the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor, e.g., CCR5, e.g., CXCR4. If a co-receptor, e.g., CCR5, e.g., CXCR4, is not present on the surface of the host cells, the virus cannot bind and enter the host cells. The progress of the disease is thus impeded. In an embodiment, by altering the CCR5 gene, e.g., introducing one or more mutations in the gene for C&#x2014;C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), e.g., by introducing a protective mutation (such as a CCR5 delta 32 mutation), knocking out the CCR5 gene or knocking down the CCR5 gene, entry of the HIV virus into the host cells is reduced or prevented. In an embodiment, by altering the CXCR4 gene, e.g., knocking out the CXCR4 gene or knocking down the CXCR4 gene, entry of the HIV virus into the host cells is reduced or prevented. In an embodiment, by multiplexing the alteration of both CCR5 and CXCR4, entry of the HIV virus into the host cells is reduced or prevented.

Once a functional coreceptor such as CCR5 and/or CXCR4 has been eliminated from the surface of the CD4 cells, CD8 cells, T cells, B cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, GALT, dendritic cells, microglia cells, myeloid progenitor cells, and/or lymphoid progenitor cells, the virus is prevented from binding and entering the host cells.

Subjects with a specific deletion in the CCR5 gene (e.g., the delta 32 deletion) have been shown to have much higher likelihood of being long-term non-progressors (meaning they did not require HAART and their HIV infection did not progress). See, e.g., Stewart G J et al., 1997 The Australian Long-Term Non-Progressor Study Group. Aids. 11:1833-1838. In addition, a subject who was CCR5+(had a wild type CCR5 receptor) and infected with HIV underwent a bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid lymphoma. See, e.g., Hutter G et al., 2009N E<smallcaps>NGL </smallcaps>J M<smallcaps>ED. </smallcaps>360:692-698. The bone marrow transplant (BMT) was from a subject homozygous for a CCR5 delta 32 deletion. Following BMT, the subject did not have progression of HIV and did not require treatment with ART. These subjects offer evidence for the fact that introduction of a protective mutation of the CCR5 gene, or knockout or knockdown of the CCR5 gene prevents, delays or diminishes the ability of HIV to infect the subject.

For example, Cas9-encoding DNA, as well as donor template nucleic acids, can be delivered, e.g., by vectors (e.g., viral or non-viral vectors), non-vector based methods (e.g., using naked DNA or DNA complexes), or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-2271" num="2424">DNA encoding Cas9 molecules (e.g., eaCas9 molecules) can be conjugated to molecules (e.g., N-acetylgalactosamine) promoting uptake by the target cells (e.g., the target cells described 10 herein).</p><p id="p-2272" num="2425">Donor template molecules can be conjugated to molecules to promote uptake by the target cells (e.g., the target cells described herein). In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a vector (e.g., viral vector/virus or plasmid).</p><p id="p-2273" num="2426">A vector can comprise a sequence that encodes a Cas9 molecule. A vector can also comprise a sequence encoding a signal peptide (e.g., for nuclear localization, nucleolar localization, mitochondrial localization), fused, e.g., to a Cas9 molecule sequence. For example, a vector can comprise a nuclear localization sequence (e.g., from SV40) fused to the sequence encoding the Cas9 molecule.</p><p id="p-2274" num="2427">One or more regulatory/control elements, e.g., a promoter, an enhancer, an intron, a polyadenylation signal, a Kozak consensus sequence, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), a 2A sequence, and splice acceptor or donor can be included in the vectors. In some embodiments, the promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase II (e.g., a CMV promoter). In other embodiments, the promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase III (e.g., a U6 promoter).

In some embodiments, the virus is a DNA virus (e.g., dsDNA or ssDNA virus). In other embodiments, the virus is an RNA virus (e.g., an ssRNA virus). Exemplary viral vectors/viruses include, e.g., retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vaccinia viruses, poxviruses, and herpes simplex viruses.</p><p id="p-2276" num="2429">In some embodiments, the virus infects dividing cells. In other embodiments, the virus infects non-dividing cells. In some embodiments, the virus infects both dividing and non-dividing cells. In some embodiments, the virus can integrate into the host genome. In some embodiments, the virus is replication-competent. In other embodiments, the virus is replication-defective, e.g., having one or more coding regions for the genes necessary for additional rounds of virion replication and/or packaging replaced with other genes or deleted. In some embodiments, the virus causes transient expression of the Cas9 molecule or molecules. In other embodiments, the virus causes long-lasting, e.g., at least 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years, or permanent expression, of the Cas9 molecule or molecules. The packaging capacity of the viruses may vary, e.g., from at least about 4 kb to at least about 30 kb, e.g., at least about 5 kb, 10 kb, 15 kb, 20 kb, 25 kb, 30 kb, 35 kb, 40 kb, 45 kb, or 50 kb.</p><p id="p-2277" num="2430">In an embodiment, the viral vector recognizes a specific cell type. For example, the viral vector can be pseudotyped with a different/alternative viral envelope glycoprotein; engineered with a cell type-specific receptor (e.g., genetic modification(s) of one or more viral envelope glycoproteins to incorporate a targeting ligand such as a peptide ligand, a single chain antibody, or a growth factor); and/or engineered to have a molecular bridge with dual specificities with one end recognizing a viral glycoprotein and the other end recognizing a moiety of the target cell surface (e.g., a ligand-receptor, monoclonal antibody, avidin-biotin and chemical conjugation).</p><p id="p-2278" num="2431">Exemplary viral vectors/viruses include, e.g., retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vaccinia viruses, poxviruses, and herpes simplex viruses.</p><p id="p-2279" num="2432">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a recombinant retrovirus. In some embodiments, the donor template nucleic acid is delivered by a recombinant retrovirus. In some embodiments, the retrovirus (e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus) comprises a reverse transcriptase, e.g., that allows integration into the host genome. In some embodiments, the retrovirus is replication-competent. In other embodiments, the retrovirus is replication-defective, e.g., having one of more coding regions for the genes necessary for additional rounds of virion replication and packaging replaced with other genes, or deleted.</p><p id="p-2280" num="2433">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a recombinant lentivirus.

In some embodiments, the donor template nucleic acid is delivered by a recombinant adenovirus.</p><p id="p-2282" num="2435">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a recombinant AAV. In some embodiments, the donor template nucleic acid is delivered by a recombinant AAV. In some embodiments, the AAV does not incorporate its geneome into that of a host cell, e.g., a target cell as describe herein. In some embodiments, the AAV can incorporate at least part of its genome into that of a host cell, e.g., a target cell as described herein. In some embodiments, the AAV is a self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV), e.g., a scAAV that packages both strands which anneal together to form double stranded DNA. AAV serotypes that may be used in the disclosed methods, include AAV1, AAV2, modified AAV2 (e.g., modifications at Y444F, Y500F, Y730F and/or S662V), AAV3, modified AAV3 (e.g., modifications at Y705F, Y731F and/or T492V), AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, modified AAV6 (e.g., modifications at S663V and/or T492V), AAV8, AAV 8.2, AAV9, AAV rh 10, and pseudotyped AAV, such as AAV2/8, AAV2/5 and AAV2/6 can also be used in the disclosed methods. In an embodiment, an AAV capsid that can be used in the methods described herein is a capsid sequence from serotype AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV.rh8, AAV.rh10, AAV.rh32/33, AAV.rh43, AAV.rh64R1, or AAV7m8.</p><p id="p-2283" num="2436">In an embodiment, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered in a re-engineered AAV capsid, e.g., with 50% or greater, e.g., 60% or greater, 70% or greater, 80% or greater, 90% or greater, or 95% or greater, sequence homology with a capsid sequence from serotypes AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV.rh8, AAV.rh10, AAV.rh32/33, AAV.rh43, or AAV.rh64R1.</p><p id="p-2284" num="2437">In an embodiment, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a chimeric AAV capsid. In some embodiments, the donor template nucleic acid is delivered by a chimeric AAV capsid. Exemplary chimeric AAV capsids include, but are not limited to, AAV9i1, AAV2i8, AAV-DJ, AAV2G9, AAV2i8G9, or AAV8G9.</p><p id="p-2285" num="2438">In an embodiment, the AAV is a self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV), e.g., a scAAV that packages both strands which anneal together to form double stranded DNA.</p><p id="p-2286" num="2439">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a hybrid virus, e.g., a hybrid of one or more of the viruses described herein. In an embodiment, the hybrid virus is hybrid of an AAV (e.g., of any AAV serotype), with a Bocavirus, B19 virus, porcine AAV, goose AAV, feline AAV, canine AAV, or MVM.</p><p id="p-2287" num="2440">A packaging cell is used to form a virus particle that is capable of infecting a target cell. Such a cell includes a 293 cell, which can package adenovirus, and a &#x3c8;2 cell or a PA317 cell, which can package retrovirus. A viral vector used in gene therapy is usually generated by a producer cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a viral particle. The vector typically contains the minimal viral sequences required for packaging and subsequent integration into a host or target cell (if applicable), with other viral sequences being replaced by an expression cassette encoding the protein to be expressed, e.g., components for a Cas9 molecule, e.g., two Cas9 components. For example, an AAV vector used in gene therapy typically only possesses inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and gene expression in the host or target cell. The missing viral functions can be supplied in trans by the packaging cell line and/or plasmid containing E2A, E4, and VA genes from adenovirus, and plasmid encoding Rep and Cap genes from AAV, as described in &#x201c;Triple Transfection Protocol.&#x201d; Henceforth, the viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but lacking ITR sequences. In embodiment, the viral DNA is packaged in a producer cell line, which contains E1A and/or E1B genes from adenovirus. The cell line is also infected with adenovirus as a helper. The helper virus (e.g., adenovirus or HSV) or helper plasmid promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes from the helper plasmid with ITRs. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by, e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV.</p><p id="p-2288" num="2441">In an embodiment, the viral vector has the ability of cell type recognition. For example, the viral vector can be pseudotyped with a different/alternative viral envelope glycoprotein; engineered with a cell type-specific receptor (e.g., genetic modification of the viral envelope glycoproteins to incorporate targeting ligands such as a peptide ligand, a single chain antibody, a growth factor); and/or engineered to have a molecular bridge with dual specificities with one end recognizing a viral glycoprotein and the other end recognizing a moiety of the target cell surface (e.g., ligand-receptor, monoclonal antibody, avidin-biotin and chemical conjugation).</p><p id="p-2289" num="2442">In an embodiment, the viral vector achieves cell type specific expression. For example, a promoter can be constructed to restrict expression of the transgene (Cas 9) in only a specific target cell. The specificity of the vector can also be mediated by microRNA-dependent control of transgene expression. In an embodiment, the viral vector has increased efficiency of fusion of the viral vector and a target cell membrane. For example, a fusion protein such as fusion-competent hemagglutinin (HA) can be incorporated to increase viral uptake into cells. In an embodiment, the viral vector has the ability of nuclear localization. For example, a virus that requires the breakdown of the cell wall (during cell division) and therefore will not infect a non-diving cell can be altered to incorporate a nuclear localization peptide in the matrix protein of the virus thereby enabling the transduction of non-proliferating cells.</p><p id="p-2290" num="2443">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a non-vector based method (e.g., using naked DNA or DNA complexes). For example, the DNA can be delivered, e.g., by organically modified silica or silicate (Ormosil), electroporation, transient cell compression or squeezing (e.g., as described in Lee, et al, 2012, Nano Lett 12: 6322-27), gene gun, sonoporation, magnetofection, lipid-mediated transfection, dendrimers, inorganic nanoparticles, calcium phosphates, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-2291" num="2444">In an embodiment, delivery via electroporation comprises mixing the cells with the Cas9-encoding DNA in a cartridge, chamber or cuvette and applying one or more electrical impulses of defined duration and amplitude. In an embodiment, delivery via electroporation is performed using a system in which cells are mixed with the Cas9-encoding DNA in a vessel connected to a device (e.g., a pump) which feeds the mixture into a cartridge, chamber or cuvette wherein one or more electrical impulses of defined duration and amplitude are applied, after which the cells are delivered to a second vessel.</p><p id="p-2292" num="2445">In some embodiments, the Cas9-encoding DNA is delivered by a combination of a vector and a non-vector based method. In some embodiments, the donor template nucleic acid is delivered by a combination of a vector and a non-vector based method. For example, a virosome comprises a liposome combined with an inactivated virus (e.g., HIV or influenza virus), which can result in more efficient gene transfer, e.g., in a respiratory epithelial cell than either a viral or a liposomal method alone.</p><p id="p-2293" num="2446">In an embodiment, the delivery vehicle is a non-viral vector. In an embodiment, the non-viral vector is an inorganic nanoparticle. Exemplary inorganic nanoparticles include, e.g., magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., Fe<sub>3</sub>MnO<sub>2</sub>) and silica. The outer surface of the nanoparticle can be conjugated with a positively charged polymer (e.g., polyethylenimine, polylysine, polyserine) which allows for attachment (e.g., conjugation or entrapment) of payload. In an embodiment, the non-viral vector is an organic nanoparticle (e.g., entrapment of the payload inside the nanoparticle). Exemplary organic nanoparticles include, e.g., SNALP liposomes that contain cationic lipids together with neutral helper lipids which are coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and protamine and nucleic acid complex coated with lipid coating.</p><p id="p-2294" num="2447">Exemplary lipids for gene transfer are shown below in Table 900.</p><p id="p-2295" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00035"

target cell update of nanoparticles and liposomes, e.g., cell specific antigens, monoclonal antibodies, single chain antibodies, aptamers, polymers, sugars, and cell penetrating peptides. In an embodiment, the vehicle uses fusogenic and endosome-destabilizing peptides/polymers. In an embodiment, the vehicle undergoes acid-triggered conformational changes (e.g., to accelerate endosomal escape of the cargo). In an embodiment, a stimuli-cleavable polymer is used, e.g., for release in a cellular compartment. For example, disulfide-based cationic polymers that are cleaved in the reducing cellular environment can be used.</p><p id="p-2299" num="2450">In an embodiment, the delivery vehicle is a biological non-viral delivery vehicle. In an embodiment, the vehicle is an attenuated bacterium (e.g., naturally or artificially engineered to be invasive but attenuated to prevent pathogenesis and expressing the transgene, e.g., <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, certain <i>Salmonella </i>strains, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, and modified <i>Escherichia coli</i>). In an embodiment, the vehicle is a genetically modified bacteriophage (e.g., engineered phages having large packaging capacity, less immunogenic, containing mammalian plasmid maintenance sequences and having incorporated targeting ligands). In an embodiment, the vehicle is a mammalian virus-like particle. For example, modified viral particles can be generated (e.g., by purification of the &#x201c;empty&#x201d; particles followed by ex vivo assembly of the virus with the desired cargo). The vehicle can also be engineered to incorporate targeting ligands to alter cell type specificity. In an embodiment, the vehicle is a biological liposome.

In an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is delivered at the same time as one or more of the components of the Cas system are delivered. In an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is delivered before or after (e.g., less than about 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks) one or more of the components of the Cas system are delivered. In an embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is delivered by a different means than one or more of the components of the Cas system, e.g., the Cas9 molecule component, are delivered.

Further, the modified nucleotide, e.g., modified nucleotide present in a modified nucleic acid, can include the wholesale replacement of an unmodified phosphate moiety with a modified phosphate as described herein. In some embodiments, the modification of the phosphate backbone can include alterations that result in either an uncharged linker or a charged linker with unsymmetrical charge distribution.</p><p id="p-2332" num="2483">Examples of modified phosphate groups include, phosphorothioate, phosphoroselenates, borano phosphates, borano phosphate esters, hydrogen phosphonates, phosphoroamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates and phosphotriesters. In some embodiments, one of the non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms in the phosphate backbone moiety can be replaced by any of the following groups: sulfur (S), selenium (Se), BR<sub>3 </sub>(wherein R can be, e.g., hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl), C (e.g., an alkyl group, an aryl group, and the like), H, NR<sub>2 </sub>(wherein R can be, e.g., hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl), or OR (wherein R can be, e.g., alkyl or aryl). The phosphorous atom in an unmodified phosphate group is achiral. However, replacement of one of the non-bridging oxygens with one of the above atoms or groups of atoms can render the phosphorous atom chiral; that is to say that a phosphorous atom in a phosphate group modified in this way is a stereogenic center. The stereogenic phosphorous atom can possess either the &#x201c;R&#x201d; configuration (herein Rp) or the &#x201c;S&#x201d; configuration (herein Sp).</p><p id="p-2333" num="2484">Phosphorodithioates have both non-bridging oxygens replaced by sulfur. The phosphorus center in the phosphorodithioates is achiral which precludes the formation of oligoribonucleotide diastereomers. In some embodiments, modifications to one or both non-bridging oxygens can also include the replacement of the non-bridging oxygens with a group independently selected from S, Se, B, C, H, N, and OR (R can be, e.g., alkyl or aryl).</p><p id="p-2334" num="2485">The phosphate linker can also be modified by replacement of a bridging oxygen, (i.e., the oxygen that links the phosphate to the nucleoside), with nitrogen (bridged phosphoroamidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates) and carbon (bridged methylenephosphonates). The replacement can occur at either linking oxygen or at both of the linking oxygens.</p><p id="p-2335" num="2486">Replacement of the Phosphate Group</p><p id="p-2336" num="2487">The phosphate group can be replaced by non-phosphorus containing connectors.

Governing gRNA Molecules and the Use Thereof to Limit the Activity of a Cas9 System</p><p id="p-2359" num="2509">Methods and compositions that use, or include, a nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, that encodes a Cas9 molecule or a gRNA molecule, can, in addition, use or include a &#x201c;governing gRNA molecule.&#x201d; The governing gRNA can limit the activity of the other CRISPR/Cas components introduced into a cell. In an embodiment, a gRNA molecule comprises a targeting domain that is complementary to a target domain on a nucleic acid that comprises a sequence that encodes a component of the CRISPR/Cas system that is introduced into a cell. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule comprises a targeting domain that is complementary with a target sequence on: (a) a nucleic acid that encodes a Cas9 molecule; (b) a nucleic acid that encodes a gRNA which comprises a targeting domain that targets the gene (a target gene gRNA); or on more than one nucleic acid that encodes a CRISPR/Cas component, e.g., both (a) and (b). The governing gRNA molecule can complex with the Cas9 molecule to inactivate a component of the system. In an embodiment, a Cas9 molecule/governing gRNA molecule complex inactivates a nucleic acid that comprises the sequence encoding the Cas9 molecule. In an embodiment, a Cas9 molecule/governing gRNA molecule complex inactivates the nucleic acid that comprises the sequence encoding a target gene gRNA molecule. In an embodiment, a Cas9 molecule/governing gRNA molecule complex places temporal, level of expression, or other limits, on activity of the Cas9 molecule/target gene gRNA molecule complex. In an embodiment, a Cas9 molecule/governing gRNA molecule complex reduces off-target or other unwanted activity. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule targets the coding sequence, or a control region, e.g., a promoter, for the CRISPR/Cas system component to be negatively regulated. For example, a governing gRNA can target the coding sequence for a Cas9 molecule, or a control region, e.g., a promoter, that regulates the expression of the Cas9 molecule coding sequence, or a sequence disposed between the two. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA molecule targets the coding sequence, or a control region, e.g., a promoter, for a target gene gRNA. In an embodiment, a governing gRNA, e.g., a Cas9-targeting or target gene gRNA-targeting, governing gRNA molecule, or a nucleic acid that encodes it, is introduced separately, e.g., later, than is the Cas9 molecule or a nucleic acid that encodes it. For example, a first vector, e.g., a viral vector, e.g., an AAV vector, can introduce nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 molecule, and a second vector, e.g., a viral vector, e.g., an AAV vector, can introduce nucleic acid encoding a governing gRNA molecule, e.g., a Cas9-targeting or target gene gRNA targeting, gRNA molecule. In an embodiment, the second vector can be introduced after the first. In other embodiments, a governing gRNA molecule, e.g., a Cas9-targeting or target gene gRNA targeting, governing gRNA molecule, or a nucleic acid that encodes it, can be introduced together, e.g., at the same time or in the same vector, with the Cas9 molecule or a nucleic acid that encodes it, but, e.g., under transcriptional control elements, e.g., a promoter or an enhancer, that are activated at a later time, e.g., such that after a period of time the transcription of Cas9 is reduced. In an embodiment, the transcriptional control element is activated intrinsically. In an embodiment, the transcriptional element is activated via the introduction of an external trigger.</p><p id="p-2360" num="2510">Typically a nucleic acid sequence encoding a governing gRNA molecule, e.g., a Cas9-targeting gRNA molecule, is under the control of a different control region, e.g., promoter, than is the component it negatively modulates, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 molecule. In an embodiment, &#x201c;different control region&#x201d; refers to simply not being under the control of one control region, e.g., promoter, that is functionally coupled to both controlled sequences. In an embodiment, different refers to &#x201c;different control region&#x201d; in kind or type of control region. For example, the sequence encoding a governing gRNA molecule, e.g., a Cas9-targeting gRNA molecule, is under the control of a control region, e.g., a promoter, that has a lower level of expression, or is expressed later than the sequence which encodes is the component it negatively modulates, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 molecule.</p><p id="p-2361" num="2511">By way of example, a sequence that encodes a governing gRNA molecule, e.g., a Cas9-targeting governing gRNA molecule, can be under the control of a control region (e.g., a promoter) described herein, e.g., human U6 small nuclear promoter, or human H1 promoter. In an embodiment, a sequence that encodes the component it negatively regulates, e.g., a nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 molecule, can be under the control of a control region (e.g., a promoter) described herein, e.g., CMV, EF-1a, EFS, MSCV, PGK, CAG control promoters.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-2362" num="2512">The following Examples are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope or content of the invention in any way.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 1: Cloning and Initial Screening of gRNAs for Cas9 Molecules</heading><p id="p-2363" num="2513">The suitability of candidate gRNAs can be evaluated as described in this example.

These preliminary transfections can comprise different gRNAs and different targeting approaches (17-mers, 20-mers, nuclease, dual-nickase, etc.) to determine which gRNAs/combinations of gRNAs give the greatest activity.</p><p id="p-2371" num="2521">Efficiency of cleavage with each gRNA may be assessed by measuring NHEJ-induced indel formation at the target locus by a T7E1-type assay or by sequencing. Alternatively, other mismatch-sensitive enzymes, such as Cell/Surveyor nuclease, may also be used.</p><p id="p-2372" num="2522">For the T7E1 assay, PCR amplicons are approximately 500-700 bp with the intended cut site placed asymmetrically in the amplicon. Following amplification, purification and size-verification of PCR products, DNA is denatured and re-hybridized by heating to 95&#xb0; C. and then slowly cooling. Hybridized PCR products are then digested with T7 Endonuclease I (or other mismatch-sensitive enzyme) which recognizes and cleaves non-perfectly matched DNA. If indels are present in the original template DNA, when the amplicons are denatured and re-annealed, this results in the hybridization of DNA strands harboring different indels and therefore lead to double-stranded DNA that is not perfectly matched. Digestion products may be visualized by gel electrophoresis or by capillary electrophoresis. The fraction of DNA that is cleaved (density of cleavage products divided by the density of cleaved and uncleaved) may be used to estimate a percent NHEJ using the following equation: % NHEJ=(1-(1-fraction cleaved)<sup>1/2</sup>). The T7E1 assay is sensitive down to about 2-5% NHEJ.</p><p id="p-2373" num="2523">Sequencing may be used instead of, or in addition to, the T7E1 assay. For Sanger sequencing, purified PCR amplicons are cloned into a plasmid backbone, transformed, miniprepped and sequenced with a single primer. Sanger sequencing may be used for determining the exact nature of indels after determining the NHEJ rate by T7E1.</p><p id="p-2374" num="2524">Sequencing may also be performed using next generation sequencing techniques. When using next generation sequencing, amplicons may be 300-500 bp with the intended cut site placed asymmetrically. Following PCR, next generation sequencing adapters and barcodes (for example Illumina multiplex adapters and indexes) may be added to the ends of the amplicon, e.g., for use in high throughput sequencing (for example on an Illumina MiSeq).

Following PCR, gene targeting efficiency to generate the desired mutations (either knockout of a target gene or removal of a target sequence motif) may be determined by sequencing. For Sanger sequencing, PCR amplicons may be 500-700 bp long. For next generation sequencing, PCR amplicons may be 300-500 bp long. If the goal is to knockout gene function, sequencing may be used to assess what percent of alleles have undergone NHEJ-induced indels that result in a frameshift or large deletion or insertion that would be expected to destroy gene function. If the goal is to remove a specific sequence motif, sequencing may be used to assess what percent of alleles have undergone NHEJ-induced deletions that span this sequence.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 3: Assessing Effect of gRNA Modifications on T Cell Viability</heading><p id="p-2377" num="2527">In order to assess how gRNA modifications affect T cell viability, <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 mRNA was delivered to Jurkat T cells in combination with an AAVS1 gRNA with or without modification.

In order to generate all of four of the aforemention versions of modified gRNAs, a DNA template comprising a T7 promoter, AAVS1 gRNA target sequence (GUCCCCUCCACCCCACAGUG) (SEQ ID NO:387), and <i>S. pyogenes </i>tracr sequence. For all gRNAs, T7 polymerase was used to generate the gRNA in the presence of 7.5 mM UTP, 7.5 mM GTP, 7.5 mM CTP and 7.5 mM ATP. In order to modify the gRNAs with a 5&#x2032; ARCA cap, 6.0 mM of ARCA analog was added to the NTP pool. Consequently, only 1.5 mM of GTP was added while the rest of the NTP pool remained at the same concentration: 7.5 mM UTP, 7.5 mM CTP and 7.5 mM ATP. In order to add a polyA tail to the gRNAs a recombinant polyA polymerase that was purified from <i>E. coli </i>was used to add a series of As to the end of the transcribed gRNA after the in vitro polymerase reaction was terminated. Termination was achieved by eliminating the DNA template with DNase I. The polyA tail reaction was performed for approximately 40 minutes. Regardless of the gRNA modification, all gRNA preparations were purified by phenol:choroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation. Once the gRNAs were generated, Jurkat T cells were electroporated with <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 mRNA (modified with a 5&#x2032; ARCA cap and polyA tail) and one of the 4 different modified AA VS1-specific gRNAs. Following electroporation cell viability was determined by performing an Annexin-V and propidium iodide double stain. The fraction of live cells, which do not stain for Annexin-V and PI was determined by flow cytometry. The results are quantified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.

A gRNA targeting the AAVS1 genomic site was used as an experimental control. Prior to electroporation, the T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and recombinant IL-2. The cells were activated using CD3/CD28 beads and expanded for at least 3 days. Subsequent to introduction of the mRNA to the activated T cells, CD3 expression on the cells was monitored at 24, 48 and 72 hours post electroporation by flow cytometry using a fluorescein (APC) conjugated antibody specific for CD3.

Following PCR, gene targeting efficiency can be determined by several methods.</p><p id="p-2388" num="2536">Determination of gene targeting frequency involves measuring the percentage of alleles that have undergone homologous directed repair (HDR) with the exogenously provided donor template or endogenous genomic donor sequence and which therefore have incorporated the desired correction. If the desired HDR event creates or destroys a restriction enzyme site, the frequency of gene targeting may be determined by a RFLP assay. If no restriction site is created or destroyed, sequencing may be used to determine gene targeting frequency. If a RFLP assay is used, sequencing may still be used to verify the desired HDR event and ensure that no other mutations are present. If an exogenously provided donor template is employed, at least one of the primers is placed in the endogenous gene sequence outside of the region included in the homology arms, which prevents amplification of donor template still present in the cells. Therefore, the length of the homology arms present in the donor template may affect the length of the PCR amplicon. PCR amplicons can either span the entire donor region (both primers placed outside the homology arms) or they can span only part of the donor region and a single junction between donor and endogenous DNA (one internal and one external primer). If the amplicons span less than the entire donor region, two different PCRs should be used to amplify and sequence both the 5&#x2032; and the 3&#x2032; junction.</p><p id="p-2389" num="2537">If the PCR amplicon is short (less than 600 bp) it is possible to use next generation sequencing. Following PCR, next generation sequencing adapters and barcodes (for example Illumina multiplex adapters and indexes) may be added to the ends of the amplicon, e.g., for use in high throughput sequencing (for example on an Illumina MiSeq). This method allows for detection of very low gene targeting rates.</p><p id="p-2390" num="2538">If the PCR amplicon is too long for next generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing can be performed.

The frequency of these various repair outcomes under different conditions offer insight into the mechanisms of DNA repair and how it is impacted by the nature of the DNA break.

Given the lack of &#x3b2;-hemoglobin by CB eyrthroblasts, disruption of the HBB locus in this model system will not impact expression of hemoglobin protein.

After in vitro transcription of the ARCA capped gRNA (mMessage Machine&#x2122; T7 Ultra Transcription Kit, Ambion), the gRNA was incubated with <i>E. coli </i>PolyA Polymerase (E-PAP), and the capped/tailed gRNA was then cleaned up using the MegaClear&#x2122; Kit (Ambion).

The gRNAs were complexed with purified <i>S. pyogenes </i>protein to generate a RNP that targets PDCD1 (PDCD1-108 (SEQ ID NO:399)) or TRBC (TRBC-210 (SEQ ID NO:388)). Briefly, the templated polyA gRNAs were complexed with <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 at a 2:1 molar ratio (gRNA:protein) for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to electroporation. The RNP complexes were delivered to primary T cells using electroporation. The primary T cells were activated prior to treatment using anti-CD3/CD28 conjugated activation beads. Post-electroporation, cells were allowed to recover for 72 hrs before taking a subset of the PDCD1-targeted cells for reactivation and subsequent PD1 FACS analysis.

The purpose of the current example was to determine whether an optimal, minimal, and specific 3&#x2032; end modification could be defined (e.g., poly-adenylation was the only 3&#x2032; end modification). The criteria for selecting a 3&#x2032; end modification is that the 3&#x2032; end modification does not reduce HSC viability and functionality (e.g., hematopoietic activity, e.g., colony forming potential) when complexed to Cas9 protein and electroporated into human HSCs and also is able to support efficient gene editing (e.g., high percentage of indel formation at targeted locus). In this example, several different modifications were engineered into the PCR DNA template for in vitro transcription of the gRNAs. For all gRNAs differentially modified at the 3&#x2032; end, each gRNA was in vitro transcribed and was modified at the 5&#x2032; end with an ARCA cap which was added during the in vitro transcription process. The HBB genetic locus was targeted for gene modification in which the sgRNA HBB-8 was modified to have the following 3&#x2032; end modifications: polyA tail of varying lengths (e.g., 2A, 5A, 10A, 15A, 20A, and 25A), poly(T) tail (e.g., 10T, 20T), and poly(G) tail (e.g., 10G, 20G). These modifications were assessed in the DNA IVT template by gel electrophoresis and in the gRNA product with the Bioanalyzer. After validation, the gRNAs were subjected to QC analysis in DSF shift assays, in which wild-type Cas9 protein was complexed with different molar ratios of gRNA to determine the optimal molar ratio of Cas9 protein:gRNA (e.g., 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, etc) at which the Cas9 protein was fully occupied or complexed with gRNA. Human CB CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were then electroporated (e.g., Amaxa Nucleofector) with Cas9 RNP in which the gRNAs complexed to Cas9 protein were differentially modified on the 3&#x2032; end. Three days after electroporation, the CB CD34+ cells were analyzed for fold expansion (e.g., viability), HSC functionality (e.g., plated into CFC assays to test differentiation potential), and gDNA extracted from samples for assessment of gene editing at the target locus by T7E1 assay and DNA sequencing analysis of the human HBB locus specific PCR products. In this experiment, gRNAs with polyA tail modifications supported the highest frequency of gene editing, as determined both by T7E1 assay analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>A</figref>) and DNA sequencing analysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b>B</figref>). DNA sequencing analysis indicated that the optimal polyA tail length was 20As. CFC analysis of colony forming potential of the RNP treated cells indicated that gene edited CD34<sup>+</sup> cells treated with RNP containing a gRNA with the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; end maintained colony forming potential in comparison to untreated (negative) control cells from the same HSC donor.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 17: Combination of 5&#x2032; End and 3&#x2032; End Modifications to gRNAs Increase Gene Editing in HSCs that Maintain their Viability and Hematopoietic Activity Ex Vivo Using a CRISPR/Cas9 D10A Dual Nickase Approach</heading><p id="p-2464" num="2608">The purpose of this example was to determine whether both 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; end modifications are required to achieve both high gene editing and maintain HSC viability and functionality.

To expand the T lymphocyte fraction from bulk MNCs, MNCs were thawed into T cell culture media (X-VIVO 15 supplemented with human AB serum, N-acetylcysteine, Glutamax (L-glutamine), and human cytokines (IL2, IL7, IL15). The T lymphocyte fraction was activated with CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads. By day 3 of MNC culture in T cell media, the cell population was 72% CD3<sup>+</sup>. After 7 days a population of &#x3e;98% CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes was obtained, most of which were also CD4<sup>+</sup> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>A</figref>). Genomic (g) DNA was extracted from patient CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and sequenced to confirm the presence of the SCD mutation.</p><p id="p-2481" num="2621">After confirmation of the sickle mutation in the patient T lymphocytes, sgRNA was designed to target the SCD mutation (HBB-8-sickle gRNA targeting sequence: GUAACGGCAGACUUCUCC<u style="single">A</u>C (SEQ ID NO:414), underline indicates SCD mutation). The gRNA was in vitro transcribed from DNA PCR product template. The HBB-8-sickle was modified to contain a 5&#x2032; ARCA cap and a 3&#x2032; polyA tail. Another gRNA HBB-15 (SEQ ID NO:397) was also in vitro transcribed and was modified to contain a 5&#x2032; ARCA cap and a 3&#x2032; polyA tail. The gRNAs were complexed to <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 protein for RNP production.</p><p id="p-2482" num="2622">To evaluate Cas RNP editing in SCD patient cells, 2 million cells were electroporated with D10A Cas9 RNP in which the protein was complex to 2 different gRNA pairs to target the sequence specific to the HBB gDNA of SCD patients (HBB-8-sickle (SEQ ID NO:414) and HBB-15 (SEQ ID NO:397)). Dual D10A nickase RNP (10 &#x3bc;g per million cells) was co-electroporated with a single strand oligonucleotide donor (SSODN, 250 pmoles per million cells). After electroporation, cells were plated into T cell media with or without CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads to determine whether restimulation of T cells after electroporation would improve survival and viability of gene edited cells. Re-plating the edited cells into culture with CD3/CD28 beads for cell reactivation improved the total viability of the electroporated cells in comparison to cells plated in T cell media without CD3/CD28 beads (% viability determined by flow cytometry analysis after staining with apoptosis stains 7-AAD and Annexin V; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>B</figref>). Gene editing was evaluated by DNA sequencing. The gRNA combination HBB-8-sickle (SEQ ID NO:414) and HBB-15 (SEQ ID NO:397) (each complexed to D10A Cas9 protein) supported 48% total editing, as detected by T7E1 endonuclease assay analysis of the HBB PCR product (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>C</figref>). Ten percent higher editing was detected in gDNA from the T lymphocytes that were reactivated with CD3/CD28 beads after electroporation, compared to cells cultured in T cell medial alone.
