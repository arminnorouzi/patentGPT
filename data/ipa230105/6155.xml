A total thickness of the backplate and the substrate in an electronic element area where a plurality of electronic elements are disposed is less than a total thickness of the backplate and the substrate in other areas. In the present disclosure, at least one of the substrate or the backplate in the electronic element area has a reduced thickness, thereby increasing light transmittance of the electronic element area. Furthermore, it is not necessary to define a hole to realize an under-display camera lens, so that an area where the camera lens is disposed can display normally, and a screen-to-body ratio is increased. As a result, a technical problem is solved: in conventional OLED display panels, a hole needs to be defined on an area where a camera lens is disposed, leading to a display effect being affected.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> only shows a display area in other areas, but does not show a non-display area in other areas.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a buffer layer <b>13</b> is disposed between the substrate <b>12</b> and the driving circuit layer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the driving circuit layer <b>14</b> includes an active layer <b>141</b>, a first gate insulating layer <b>142</b>, a first metal layer <b>143</b>, a second gate insulating layer <b>144</b>, a second metal layer <b>145</b>, an interlayer insulating layer <b>146</b>, a source/drain layer <b>147</b>, and a planarization layer <b>148</b>. A mass fraction of phosphorus in the active layer <b>141</b> in the electronic element area <b>211</b> is greater than a mass fraction of phosphorus in the active layer <b>141</b> in other areas <b>212</b>. By doping phosphorus into a channel area <b>311</b> of the active layer in the electronic element area when forming the active layer, a threshold voltage of a transistor of the driving circuit layer falls to a negative bias voltage which offsets a positive bias voltage of a transistor of the driving circuit layer caused by a following process of removing the substrate and/or the backplate in the electronic element area. Therefore, a thickness of the substrate and/or the backplate in the electronic element area is reduced without causing threshold voltage of the transistor to be positively biased, so that a display effect will not be affected. As a result, a technical problem is solved: threshold voltage of a transistor is positively biased when a thickness of a substrate and a backplate is reduced.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the active layer <b>141</b> includes the channel area <b>311</b> and a doped area <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the transistor of the driving circuit layer includes a P-type transistor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the OLED display panel includes a plurality of pixel units. A density of the pixel units in the electronic element area is less than a density of the pixel units in other areas. That is, considering a problem of light being blocked by metal layers in the driving circuit layer, an amount of the pixel units is reduced, so that a density of the pixels in the electronic element area is reduced. Therefore, a light transmittance of the electronic element area is increased, and an under-display camera can be realized without defining a hole.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, a thickness of the backplate in the electronic element area is less than a thickness of the backplate in other areas, and a thickness of substrate in the electronic element area is equal to a thickness of the substrate in other areas. Because the backplate has a relatively strong effect on blocking light, the thickness of the backplate in the electronic element area is changed, and the thickness of the substrate remains unchanged. Therefore, light transmittance is increased, light can be transmitted into the electronic elements, and an under-display camera can be realized and can work normally.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, a thickness of the substrate in the electronic element area is less than a thickness of the substrate in other areas, and a thickness of the backplate in the electronic element area is equal to a thickness of the backplate in other areas. When the thickness of the backplate remains unchanged, because the substrate, especially a substrate with high temperature resistance, has a relatively strong effect on blocking light, the substrate is made of yellow polyimide, which causes light to be further blocked by the substrate. Therefore, light cannot effectively reach the electronic elements. In the present embodiment, the thickness of the substrate in the electronic element area is reduced, thereby increasing light transmittance of the electronic element area.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a thickness of the backplate <b>11</b> in the electronic element area <b>211</b> is less than a thickness of the backplate <b>11</b> in other areas <b>212</b>, and a thickness of the substrate <b>12</b> in the electronic element area <b>211</b> is less than a thickness of the substrate <b>12</b> in other areas <b>212</b>. To increase light transmittance of the electronic element area, a thickness of the backplate and a thickness of the substrate are reduced at the same time. Therefore, light can effectively pass through the OLED display panel and reach the electronic elements, and light transmittance of the electronic element area is increased. The electronic elements may receive a similar amount of light compared with electronic elements in an OLED display panel with a hole.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, a material of the backplate includes polyethylene terephthalate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the substrate <b>12</b> includes a first flexible layer <b>121</b>, a barrier layer <b>122</b>, and a second flexible layer <b>123</b>.

A thickness of the first flexible layer in the electronic element area is reduced. However, because the OLED display panel needs to block moisture and oxygen, thicknesses of the barrier layer and the second flexible layer remain unchanged. Therefore, they can prevent moisture and oxygen from entering the OLED display panel. Furthermore, since the thickness of the first flexible layer is reduced, light transmittance of the electronic element area is increased.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, a material of the first flexible layer is polyimide.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, a material of the second flexible layer is polyimide.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an adhesive layer <b>22</b> is disposed between the first flexible layer <b>121</b> and the backplate <b>11</b>.

When using the adhesive layer to attach the backplate to the substrate, because light transmittance is also be affected by the adhesive layer, the thickness of the adhesive layer in the electronic element area is reduced. Therefore, light transmittance of the electronic element area is increased.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, a material of the adhesive layer includes an optically clear adhesive.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the light-emitting functional layer <b>15</b> includes a pixel electrode layer <b>151</b>, a pixel defining layer <b>152</b>, a luminescent layer <b>153</b>, and a common electrode layer <b>154</b>. A material of the pixel electrode layer and a material of the common electrode layer includes indium tin oxide (ITO). By using ITO to form the pixel electrode layer and the common electrode layer, they may have better light transmittance, and light transmittance of the electronic element area may be increased.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, a thickness of the backplate in the electronic element area is 0. To increase light transmittance of the electronic element area, the backplate in the electronic element area may be removed.

To increase light transmittance of the electronic element area.

The OLED display panel includes a backplate, a substrate, a driving circuit layer, a light-emitting functional layer, and an encapsulation layer. The substrate is disposed on the backplate, the driving circuit layer is disposed on the substrate, the light-emitting functional layer is disposed on the driving circuit layer, and the encapsulation layer is disposed on the light-emitting functional layer. A total thickness of the backplate and the substrate in an electronic element area where the plurality of electronic elements are disposed is less than a total thickness of the backplate and the substrate in other areas. When manufacturing the OLED display panel, phosphorus is doped in a channel area of the active layer, so that threshold voltage of a transistor in the electronic element area is negatively biased. When removing the backplate and the first flexible layer in the electronic element area, threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element is positively biased. Therefore, light transmittance of the electronic element area is increased, threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element area is not positively biased, and the OLED display panel can display normally.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, phosphorus, such as phosphine, can be doped into the channel area of the active layer, so that threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element area is negatively biased.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, a step of removing the backplate and the first flexible layer includes: removing the backplate and the first flexible layer in the electronic element layer by using a laser.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the abscissa indicates threshold voltage Vgs of the transistor in the electronic element layer, and the ordinate indicates a leakage current of the transistor in the electronic element layer. After doping phosphorus into the channel area of the active layer in the electronic element area, the threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element area will be negatively biased (from curved line <b>42</b> to curved line <b>41</b>). After using a laser to remove the backplate and the first flexible layer, threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element area will be positively biased (from curved line <b>41</b> to curved line <b>42</b>). Therefore, light transmittance of the electronic element area can be increased without biasing threshold voltage of the transistor, and the display panel can display normally. Furthermore, a negative bias voltage of the transistor caused by doping the phosphorus and a positive bias voltage of the transistor caused by removing the backplate and the first flexible layer may be equal. For example, after using a laser to remove the backplate and the first flexible layer, a positive shift in threshold voltage of the transistor in the electronic element area is &#x394;Vth. We can control an amount of doped phosphorus to make the threshold voltage of the transistor be based at a negative voltage, that is, the threshold voltage of the transistor is changed from Vth<b>1</b> to Vth<b>2</b>, and |Vth<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth<b>2</b>|=&#x394;Vth. As a result, after being processed, the OLED display panel may have the electronic element area with increased light transmittance.
