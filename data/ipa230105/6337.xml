Compared with the antenna in the form of flexible circuit board, the antenna <b>115</b> with the above structure does not increase the overall thickness of the electronic device <b>100</b>, so it is beneficial to the thin and light design of the electronic device <b>100</b>, and further beneficial to the thin and light design of the wearable device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With respect to the electronic device <b>100</b>, the antenna <b>115</b> is exposed to the mating surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the middle frame <b>110</b>, and the display module <b>130</b> is stacked on the mating surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>and covers the antenna <b>115</b> and the mounting cavity <b>101</b>, as such, compared with the antenna in the form of the flexible circuit board, the above antenna <b>115</b> can reduce the overall thickness of the electronic device <b>100</b>. For example, the thickness of the antenna <b>115</b> in the form of the flexible circuit board is usually about 0.25 millimeters (mm). Compared with the antenna in the form of flexible circuit board, the overall thickness of the electronic device <b>100</b> of the present disclosure can be reduced by 0.25 mm, which is beneficial to the thin and light design of the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the antenna <b>115</b> is formed on the support <b>113</b>, a distance between the antenna <b>115</b> and an outer surface of the display module <b>130</b> is relatively small after the mating surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>is connected to the display module <b>130</b>.

Further, in other embodiments, the antenna <b>115</b> can be another typed antenna, such as an antenna for transmitting and receiving cellular signals, and the antenna <b>115</b> with the above structure can also improve the communication performance of the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the support <b>113</b> is defined with a groove opening <b>113</b><i>c </i>of the mounting cavity <b>101</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention, a cross section of the groove opening <b>113</b><i>c </i>is substantially a rounded rectangle, that is, four corners of the rectangle are formed by arc transition. The support <b>113</b> is enclosed in a circumferential direction of the groove opening <b>113</b><i>c</i>, and the mating surface <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the antenna receiving slot <b>113</b><i>b </i>extend in the circumferential direction of the groove opening <b>113</b><i>c</i>.

The arrangement of the limiting portion <b>1133</b> facilitates the assembly and positioning of the display module <b>130</b> on the support <b>113</b>.
