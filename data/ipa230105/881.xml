Two examples of psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorders (MDDs) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), are common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illnesses. More than 20% of the adult population suffers from these conditions at some time during their life. Suicide is estimated to be a cause of death in up to approximately 15% of individuals with MDDs. In addition, MDDs represent a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and death after myocardial infarction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Treatments for anxiety, depression and the like include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine HRI (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft); selective serotonin &#x26; norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs), such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla), desvenlafaxine succinate (Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), and venlafaxine (Effexor); tetracyclic antidepressants of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSAs), such as Remeron; tricyclic antidepressants, such as Elavil, imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and Sinequan; monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (EMSAM), and tranylcypromine (Parnate); and benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), buspirone (Buspar), and lorazepam (Ativan). These drugs do carry a risk of addiction, tolerance, loss of effectiveness, inciting violent or self-destructive actions, fatigue, and drowsiness along with nausea, increased appetite and weight gain, loss of sexual desire and other sexual problems, insomnia, dry mouth, blurred vision, and so on.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Clinically, new treatments are highly and urgently needed that have tremendous improvement and significant impact to the management of patients with psychiatric disorders, such as treatments being highly effective and with much less adverse effects.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Treatments of psychiatric disorders based on pharmacological mechanisms of action of SSRI, SNRI, NaSSA and MAOI have shown their limitations. Increasing evidence indicates that inflammatory processes can cause and contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Inflammation can be defined as one of the immune responses for protecting living organisms from damage. The immune system can be triggered by various factors such as pathogens, damage to cells and stress that may induce acute or chronic inflammatory responses in organs including the brain, potentially leading to tissue damage or disease. The latest advancements in neurobiological research provides increasing evidence that inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways play a relevant role in depression and anxiety. Preclinical and clinical studies on depression and anxiety highlighted an increased production of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b1; and interferon (INF)-&#x3b1; and &#x3b3;, and overactivated inflammatory signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B). Other studies show that acute and chronic administration of cytokines or cytokine inducers were found to trigger depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. According to the cytokine hypothesis, depression and anxiety would be due to a stress-related increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in turn, would lead to increased oxidative and nitrosative brain damage and consequent reduced availability of tryptophan and serotonin (5-HT). Cytokines would also play a role in the onset of the glucocorticoid resistance, underlying the overdrive of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, activation of the inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways would lead to the brain damage observed in depression and/or anxiety through both reduced neurogenesis and increased neurodegeneration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Azelastine is classified pharmacologically as a second-generation antihistamine and is a relatively selective, non-sedative, competitive antagonist at H<sub>1 </sub>receptors for treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma. But, more uniquely, its inhibition of inflammatory mediators and its mast cell stabilizing effects, in addition to its antihistaminic activity, place it among the new generation of dual-acting anti-inflammatory drugs. Its ability to modify several other mediators of inflammation, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1; and INF-&#x3b1;, and to reduce overactivation of NF-&#x3ba;B inflammatory signaling pathway might contribute to its mechanism of action of potential treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, agitation, bipolar disorder (BD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD). In vitro and in vivo studies, as well as clinical trials support the dual effects of direct inhibition and stabilization of inflammatory cells. In vitro data indicate that azelastine's affinity for inhibition of mast cell degranulation may also decrease the release of other inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes and interleukin-1&#x3b2;, among others. Preclinical studies show that azelastine also directly antagonizes other mediators of inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;, leukotrienes, endothelin-1, and platelet-activating factor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alprazolam, the 19th most prescribed drug with 27 million prescriptions in the United States in 2019, is a benzodiazepine derivative that is currently used in the treatment of generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. Alprazolam binds non-selectively to the gamma-amino butyric acid A (GABAA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex. At the receptor complex, alprazolam facilitates the binding of GABA and increases the influx of chloride ions. The presence of GABA, in turn, inhibits the action of several connected brain structures, resulting in a general slowing of brain activity. Further, the activated GABA system interacts with other neurotransmitter systems, including noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and opioidergic systems. Alprazolam's interactions with the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways to the limbic system and brain stem structures (e.g., locus coeruleus) contribute to its clinical effectiveness in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Alprazolam has a fast onset of symptom relief and is significantly superior to placebo. But its adverse effects, such as cognitive and psychomotor effects, drowsiness, sedation, withdrawal and rebound effects limit its therapeutic applications. One of the most critical adverse effects of alprazolam is to impair performance in a variety of skills in patients due to its effect on psychomotor and memory functioning.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a unique combination of azelastine (antihistamine agent with anti-inflammatory activities) with alprazolam (GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex agonist) would potentially be, in terms of working through multi-mechanisms of actions, effective treatments for psychiatric disorders.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention includes a pharmaceutical composition that comprises two active pharmaceutical ingredients.

If soft capsules are desired, a slurry of the pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable vegetable, light petroleum or other inert oil can be encapsulated by forming into a gelatin capsule.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Suspensions, syrups and elixirs may be used for oral administration or fluid unit dosage forms. A fluid preparation including oil may be used for oil soluble forms. A vegetable oil such as corn oil, peanut oil or a flower oil, for example, together with flavoring agents, sweeteners and any preservatives produces an acceptable fluid preparation. A surfactant may be added to water to form a syrup for fluid unit dosages. Hydro-alcoholic pharmaceutical preparations may be used having an acceptable sweetener, such as sugar, saccharin or other non-nutritive sweetener, and/or a biological sweetener and/or a flavoring agent, such as in the form of an elixir.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The solid oral dosage formulation of this disclosure means a form of tablets, caplets, bi-layer tablets, film-coated tablets, pills, capsules, or the like. Tablets in accordance with this disclosure can be prepared by any mixing and tableting techniques that are well known in the pharmaceutical formulation industry. In some examples, the dosage formulation is fabricated by direct compressing the respectively prepared sustained-release portion and the immediate-release portion by punches and dies fitted to a rotary tableting press, ejection or compression molding or granulation followed by compression.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pharmaceutical compositions provided in accordance with the present disclosure can be typically administered orally. This disclosure therefore provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a solid dispersion comprising azelastine and alprazolam as described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers including but not limited to, inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers, disintegrants, lubricants, binders, glidants, adjuvants, and combinations thereof. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical arts (see, e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Tenth (by Loyd Allen, 2013) and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Formulations (Volumes 1-6 by Sarfaraz K. Niazi)).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pharmaceutical compositions may further comprise pharmaceutical excipients such as diluents, binders, fillers, glidants, disintegrants, lubricants, solubilizers, and combinations thereof. Some examples of suitable excipients are described herein. When the pharmaceutical compositions are formulated into tablets, tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions can comprise a) about 1 mg-8 mg of azelastine HCl (or other salt thereof) and b) about 0.2 mg to 4 mg of alprazolam or a) about 2 mg-6 mg of azelastine HCl (or other salt thereof) and b) about 0.2 mg to 1 mg of alprazolam or a) about 2 mg-4 mg of azelastine HCl (or other salt thereof) and b) about 0.2 mg to 0.4 mg of alprazolam, or any amount of azelastine or alprazolam within these ranges. Additional embodiments include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a) about up to and including any of 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg or 8 mg azelastine, such as azelastine HCl, or any amount within any of these ranges and b) about up to and including any of 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, 0.5 mg 0.6 mg, 0.7 mg, 0.8 mg, 0.9 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 3 mg, 3.5 mg, or 4 mg alprazolam, or any salt thereof, or any amount within any of these ranges. For example, the compositions can comprise a) about 2 mg of azelastine HCl and b) about 0.4 mg of alprazolam HCl. Further, for example, compositions of the invention can comprise azelastine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of azelastine present in an amount in the range of about 1 mg to about 8 mg and alprazolam in an amount in the range of about 0.2 mg to about 4 mg. In embodiments, the amount of azelastine HCl (or other salt thereof) present in the composition can be equal to, more than, or less than the amount of alprazolam present in the composition. In embodiments, the amount of azelastine HCl (and/or other salt thereof) present in the composition can be 2 times as much, or 3 times as much, or 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 times as much as the amount of alprazolam present in the composition, or vice versa. Any one or more of the compositions of the invention can be used with any one or more the methods of the invention disclosed herein, or other methods of using the compositions.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It will be understood, that the amount of the pharmaceutical composition containing azelastine HCl and alprazolam actually administered usually will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pharmaceutical compositions, pharmaceutical dosage forms, and tablets containing azelastine, such as azelastine HCl, and alprazolam as described herein are administered to a patient suffering from one or more psychiatric disorders such as MDD, GAD, panic disorder, agitation, SAD, MCD, OCD, PDD, SAD, dysthymia, childhood enuresis, bipolar disorder, PSD or SDRA, by administration (such as oral administration) once daily, twice daily, up to four times a day, once every other day, once a week, two times a week, three times a week, four times a week, or five times a week, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments, patients are administered the pharmaceutical composition(s) with a therapeutic effective daily dosage of azelastine (such as azelastine HCl) in the range of about 1 mg to about 8 mg and alprazolam or salt thereof in an amount in the range of about 0.2 mg to about 4 mg.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage forms and tablets of pharmaceutical compositions containing azelastine, such as azelastine HCl, and alprazolam as described herein are effective in reversing, reducing, alleviating, and/or treating one or more symptoms in patients with one or more psychiatric disorders such as MDD, GAD, panic disorder, agitation, SAD, MCD, OCD, PDD, SAD, dysthymia, childhood enuresis, bipolar disorder, PSD, or SDRA in about 1-8 weeks, such as within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 weeks, or any range in between.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The following Examples are illustrative and should not be interpreted to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A 50 year old male patient had generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agitation. He was treated with different doses of fluoxetine alone for 4 months, sertraline of SSRIs alone for 6 months, and alprazolam (2.0 mg/daily) of benzodiazepines alone for 4 months but had no significant clinical improvement with any of these treatments. When all of his symptoms worsened, he was given a composition of alprazolam of 0.4 mg and azelastine of 2 mg once daily for 2 weeks, his symptoms started having a dramatic improvement. By 6 weeks of the treatment, he showed no symptoms of agitation and panic disorder and his anxiety disorder was reduced by more than 80%. Because azelastine is approved for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma and has never been used to treat patients with depression or anxiety, this dramatic clinical outcome from this composition is unexpected. Although the inventors do not intend to be bound by this theory, it is believed that azelastine's anti-inflammatory action by suppressing release of cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x3b1; and INF-&#x3b1;, in the CNS system may help alprazolam effectively bind to GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex which creates an effective presence of GABA to inhibit the action of several connected brain structures and further results in slowing of brain activity. This way of activating the GABA system may interact more effectively with other neurotransmitter systems, including noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and opioidergic systems. Further, azelastine's anti-inflammatory action may help alprazolam interact in more effective ways with the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways to the limbic system and brain stem structures. This composition of two mechanisms of action for two different classes of diseases provided a new solution for treating psychiatric diseases which are incurable by other options, such traditional SSRIs, NSRIs, benzodiazepines, and the like alone.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A 52 year old female patient had generalized anxiety disorder, agitation and insomnia for 8 months and no treatment had been effective, including SSRIs or benzodiazepines (such as 2.0 mg/daily alprazolam) alone, before she was treated with a composition of alprazolam of 0.4 mg and azelastine of 2 mg once daily. After 2 weeks, she exhibited dramatic clinical improvement and showed no symptoms of agitation and her anxiety disorder was reduced by more than 50%. The inventors believe the hypothesis as explained in example 1 above is applicable here as well. In this case, the composition of two mechanisms of action for two different classes of diseases provided a new solution for treating her generalized anxiety diseases and agitation along with insomnia which could not be treated with other options, such traditional SSRIs, NSRIs, benzodiazepines, and the like alone.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A 78 year old male patient had major depressive disorder and agitation for about 2 years and no treatment, including fluoxetine alone from SSRIs or alprazolam (2.0 mg/daily) alone from benzodiazepines, had been effective before he was treated with a composition of alprazolam of 0.4 mg and azelastine of 2 mg twice daily. After 4 weeks of treatment, he exhibited dramatic clinical improvement, showed no symptoms of agitation, and his major depressive disorder was reduced by more than 50%. The inventors believe the hypothesis as explained in example 1 above is applicable here as well. In this case, the composition of two mechanisms of action for two different classes of diseases provided a new solution for treating his major depressive disorder and agitation which could not be treated with other options, such traditional SSRIs, NSRIs, benzodiazepines, and the like alone.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0060">U.S. Pat.
