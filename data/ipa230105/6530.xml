num="0127">Disclosed embodiments may involve an optical system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;optical system&#x201d; broadly includes any system that is used for the generation, detection and/or manipulation of light. By way of example only, an optical system may include one or more optical components for generating, detecting and/or manipulating light. For example, light sources, lenses, mirrors, prisms, beam splitters, collimators, polarizing optics, optical modulators, optical switches, optical amplifiers, optical detectors, optical sensors, fiber optics, semiconductor optic components, while each not necessarily required, may each be part of an optical system. In addition to the one or more optical components, an optical system may also include other non-optical components such as electrical components, mechanical components, chemical reaction components, and semiconductor components. The non-optical components may cooperate with optical components of the optical system. For example, the optical system may include at least one processor for analyzing detected light.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Consistent with the present disclosure, the optical system may be a LIDAR system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;LIDAR system&#x201d; broadly includes any system which can determine values of parameters indicative of a distance between a pair of tangible objects based on reflected light. In one embodiment, the LIDAR system may determine a distance between a pair of tangible objects based on reflections of light emitted by the LIDAR system. As used herein, the term &#x201c;determine distances&#x201d; broadly includes generating outputs which are indicative of distances between pairs of tangible objects. The determined distance may represent the physical dimension between a pair of tangible objects. By way of example only, the determined distance may include a line of flight distance between the LIDAR system and another tangible object in a field of view of the LIDAR system. In another embodiment, the LIDAR system may determine the relative velocity between a pair of tangible objects based on reflections of light emitted by the LIDAR system. Examples of outputs indicative of the distance between a pair of tangible objects include: a number of standard length units between the tangible objects (e.g. number of meters, number of inches, number of kilometers, number of millimeters), a number of arbitrary length units (e.g. number of LIDAR system lengths), a ratio between the distance to another length (e.g. a ratio to a length of an object detected in a field of view of the LIDAR system), an amount of time (e.g. given as standard unit, arbitrary units or ratio, for example, the time it takes light to travel between the tangible objects), one or more locations (e.g. specified using an agreed coordinate system, specified in relation to a known location), and more.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The LIDAR system may determine the distance between a pair of tangible objects based on reflected light. In one embodiment, the LIDAR system may process detection results of a sensor which creates temporal information indicative of a period of time between the emission of a light signal and the time of its detection by the sensor. The period of time is occasionally referred to as &#x201c;time of flight&#x201d; of the light signal. In one example, the light signal may be a short pulse, whose rise and/or fall time may be detected in reception. Using known information about the speed of light in the relevant medium (usually air), the information regarding the time of flight of the light signal can be processed to provide the distance the light signal traveled between emission and detection. In another embodiment, the LIDAR system may determine the distance based on frequency phase-shift (or multiple frequency phase-shift). Specifically, the LIDAR system may process information indicative of one or more modulation phase shifts (e.g. by solving some simultaneous equations to give a final measure) of the light signal. For example, the emitted optical signal may be modulated with one or more constant frequencies. The at least one phase shift of the modulation between the emitted signal and the detected reflection may be indicative of the distance the light traveled between emission and detection. The modulation may be applied to a continuous wave light signal, to a quasi-continuous wave light signal, or to another type of emitted light signal. It is noted that additional information may be used by the LIDAR system for determining the distance, e.g. location information (e.g. relative positions) between the projection location, the detection location of the signal (especially if distanced from one another), and more.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the LIDAR<sub>system </sub>may be used for detecting a plurality of objects in an environment of the LIDAR system. The term &#x201c;detecting an object in an environment of the LIDAR system&#x201d; broadly includes generating information which is indicative of an object that reflected light toward a detector associated with the LIDAR system. If more than one object is detected by the LIDAR system, the generated information pertaining to different objects may be interconnected, for example a car is driving on a road, a bird is sitting on the tree, a man touches a bicycle, a van moves towards a building. The dimensions of the environment in which the LIDAR system detects objects may vary with respect to implementation. For example, the LIDAR system may be used for detecting a plurality of objects in an environment of a vehicle on which the LIDAR system is installed, up to a horizontal distance of 100 m (or 200 m, 300 m, etc.), and up to a vertical distance of 10 m (or 25 m, 50 m, etc.). In another example, the LIDAR system may be used for detecting a plurality of objects in an environment of a vehicle or within a predefined horizontal range (e.g., 25&#x3b8;, 50&#xb0;, 100&#xb0;, 180&#xb0;, etc.), and up to a predefined vertical elevation (e.g., &#xb1;10&#xb0;, &#xb1;20&#xb0;, +40&#xb0;-20&#xb0;, &#xb1;90&#xb0; or 0&#xb0;-90&#xb0;).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">As used herein, the term &#x201c;detecting an object&#x201d; may broadly refer to determining an existence of the object (e.g., an object may exist in a certain direction with respect to the LIDAR system and/or to another reference location, or an object may exist in a certain spatial volume). Additionally or alternatively, the term &#x201c;detecting an object&#x201d; may refer to determining a distance between the object and another location (e.g. a location of the LIDAR system, a location on earth, or a location of another object). Additionally or alternatively, the term &#x201c;detecting an object&#x201d; may refer to identifying the object (e.g. classifying a type of object such as car, plant, tree, road; recognizing a specific object (e.g., the Washington Monument); determining a license plate number; determining a composition of an object (e.g., solid, liquid, transparent, semitransparent); determining a kinematic parameter of an object (e.g., whether it is moving, its velocity, its movement direction, expansion of the object). Additionally or alternatively, the term &#x201c;detecting an object&#x201d; may refer to generating a point cloud map in which every point of one or more points of the point cloud map correspond to a location in the object or a location on a face thereof. In one embodiment, the data resolution associated with the point cloud map representation of the field of view may be associated with 0.1&#xb0;&#xd7;0.1&#xb0; or 0.3&#xb0;&#xd7;0.3&#xb0; of the field of view.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Consistent with the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;object&#x201d; broadly includes a finite composition of matter that may reflect light from at least a portion thereof. For example, an object may be at least partially solid (e.g. cars, trees); at least partially liquid (e.g. puddles on the road, rain); at least partly gaseous (e.g. fumes, clouds); made from a multitude of distinct particles (e.g. sand storm, fog, spray); and its size may be of one or more scales of magnitude, such as &#x2dc;1 millimeter (mm), &#x2dc;5 mm, &#x2dc;10 mm, &#x2dc;50 mm, &#x2dc;100 mm, &#x2dc;500 mm, &#x2dc;1 meter (m), &#x2dc;5 m, &#x2dc;10 m, &#x2dc;50 m, &#x2dc;100 m, and so on. Smaller or larger objects, as well as any size in between those examples, may also be detected. It is noted that for various reasons, the LIDAR system may detect only part of the object. For example, in some cases, light may be reflected from only some sides of the object (e.g., only the side facing the LIDAR system will be detected); in other cases, light may be projected on only part of the object (e.g. laser beam projected onto a road or a building); in other cases, the object may be partly blocked by another object between the LIDAR system and the detected object; in other cases, the LIDAR's sensor may only detect light reflected from a portion of the object, e.g., because ambient light or other interferences interfere with detection of some portions of the object.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Consistent with the present disclosure, a LIDAR system may be configured to detect objects by scanning the environment of the LIDAR system. The term &#x201c;scanning the environment of the LIDAR system&#x201d; broadly includes illuminating the field of view or a portion of the field of view of the LIDAR system. In one example, scanning the environment of the LIDAR system may be achieved by moving or pivoting a light deflector to deflect light in differing directions toward different parts of the field of view. In another example, scanning the environment of the LIDAR system may be achieved by changing a positioning (i.e. location and/or orientation) of a sensor with respect to the field of view. In another example, scanning the environment of the LIDAR system may be achieved by changing a positioning (i.e. location and/or orientation) of a light source with respect to the field of view. In yet another example, scanning the environment of the LIDAR system may be achieved by changing the positions of at least one light source and of at least one sensor to move rigidly with respect to the field of view (i.e. the relative distance and orientation of the at least one sensor and of the at least one light source remains).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As used herein the term &#x201c;field of view of the LIDAR system&#x201d; may broadly include an extent of the observable environment of LIDAR system in which objects may be detected. It is noted that the field of view (FOV) of the LIDAR system may be affected by various conditions such as but not limited to: an orientation of the LIDAR system (e.g. is the direction of an optical axis of the LIDAR system); a position of the LIDAR system with respect to the environment (e.g. distance above ground and adjacent topography and obstacles); operational parameters of the LIDAR system (e.g. emission power, computational settings, defined angles of operation), etc. The field of view of LIDAR system may be defined, for example, by a solid angle (e.g. defined using &#x3d5;, &#x3b8; angles, in which &#x3d5; and &#x3b8; are angles defined in perpendicular planes, e.g. with respect to symmetry axes of the LIDAR system and/or its FOV). In one example, the field of view may also be defined within a certain range (e.g. up to 200 m).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Similarly, the term &#x201c;instantaneous field of view&#x201d; may broadly include an extent of the observable environment in which objects may be detected by the LIDAR system at any given moment. For example, for a scanning the LIDAR system, the instantaneous field of view is narrower than the entire FOV of the LIDAR system, and it can be moved within the FOV of the LIDAR system in order to enable detection in other parts of the FOV of the LIDAR system. The movement of the instantaneous field of view within the FOV of the LIDAR system may be achieved by moving a light deflector of the LIDAR system (or external to the LIDAR system), so as to deflect beams of light to and/or from the LIDAR system in differing directions. In one embodiment, the LIDAR system may be configured to scan scene in the environment in which the LIDAR system is operating. As used herein the term &#x201c;scene&#x201d; may broadly include some or all of the objects within the field of view of the LIDAR system, in their relative positions and in their current states, within an operational duration of the LIDAR system. For example, the scene may include ground elements (e.g. earth, roads, grass, sidewalks, road surface marking), sky, man-made objects (e.g. vehicles, buildings, signs), vegetation, people, animals, light projecting elements (e.g. flashlights, sun, other LIDAR systems), and so on.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Disclosed embodiments may involve obtaining information for use in generating reconstructed three-dimensional models. Examples of types of reconstructed three-dimensional models which may be used include point cloud models, and Polygon Mesh (e.g. a triangle mesh). The terms &#x201c;point cloud&#x201d; and &#x201c;point cloud model&#x201d; are widely known in the art, and should be construed to include a set of data points located spatially in some coordinate system (i.e., having an identifiable location in a space described by a respective coordinate system). The term &#x201c;point cloud point&#x201d; refer to a point in space (which may be dimensionless, or a miniature cellular space, e.g. 1 cm<sup>3</sup>), and whose location may be described by the point cloud model using a set of coordinates (e.g. (X,Y,Z), (r,&#x3d5;,&#x3b8;)). By way of example only, the point cloud model may store additional information for some or all of its points (e.g. color information for points generated from camera images). Likewise, any other type of reconstructed three-dimensional model may store additional information for some or all of its objects. Similarly, the terms &#x201c;polygon mesh&#x201d; and &#x201c;triangle mesh&#x201d; are widely known in the art, and are to be construed to include, among other things, a set of vertices, edges and faces that define the shape of one or more 3D objects (such as a polyhedral object). The faces may include one or more of the following: triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals, or other simple convex polygons, since this may simplify rendering. The faces may also include more general concave polygons, or polygons with holes. Polygon meshes may be represented using differing techniques, such as: Vertex-vertex meshes, Face-vertex meshes, Winged-edge meshes and Render dynamic meshes. Different portions of the polygon mesh (e.g., vertex, face, edge) are located spatially in some coordinate system (i.e., having an identifiable location in a space described by the respective coordinate system), either directly and/or relative to one another. The generation of the reconstructed three-dimensional model may be implemented using any standard, dedicated and/or novel photogrammetry technique, many of which are known in the art. It is noted that other types of models of the environment may be generated by the LIDAR system.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the LIDAR<sub>system </sub>may include at least one projecting unit with a light source configured to project light. As used herein the term &#x201c;light source&#x201d; broadly refers to any device configured to emit light. In one embodiment, the light source may be a laser such as a solid-state laser, laser diode, a high power laser, or an alternative light source such as, a light emitting diode (LED)-based light source. In addition, light source <b>112</b> as illustrated throughout the figures, may emit light in differing formats, such as light pulses, continuous wave (CW), quasi-CW, and so on. For example, one type of light source that may be used is a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). Another type of light source that may be used is an external cavity diode laser (ECDL). In some examples, the light source may include a laser diode configured to emit light at a wavelength between about 650 nm and 1150 nm. Alternatively, the light source may include a laser diode configured to emit light at a wavelength between about 800 nm and about 1000 nm, between about 850 nm and about 950 nm, or between about 1300 nm and about 1600 nm. Unless indicated otherwise, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; with regards to a numeric value is defined as a variance of up to 5% with respect to the stated value. Additional details on the projecting unit and the at least one light source are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the LIDAR<sub>system </sub>may include at least one scanning unit with at least one light deflector configured to deflect light from the light source in order to scan the field of view. The term &#x201c;light deflector&#x201d; broadly includes any mechanism or module which is configured to make light deviate from its original path; for example, a mirror, a prism, controllable lens, a mechanical mirror, mechanical scanning polygons, active diffraction (e.g. controllable LCD), Risley prisms, non-mechanical-electro-optical beam steering (such as made by Vscent), polarization grating (such as offered by Boulder Non-Linear Systems), optical phased array (OPA), and more. In one embodiment, a light deflector may include a plurality of optical components, such as at least one reflecting element (e.g. a mirror), at least one refracting element (e.g. a prism, a lens), and so on. In one example, the light deflector may be movable, to cause light deviate to differing degrees (e.g. discrete degrees, or over a continuous span of degrees). The light deflector may optionally be controllable in different ways (e.g. deflect to a degree a, change deflection angle by &#x394;&#x3b1;, move a component of the light deflector by M millimeters, change speed in which the deflection angle changes). In addition, the light deflector may optionally be operable to change an angle of deflection within a single plane (e.g., &#x3b8; coordinate). The light deflector may optionally be operable to change an angle of deflection within two non-parallel planes (e.g., &#x3b8; and &#x3d5; coordinates). Alternatively or in addition, the light deflector may optionally be operable to change an angle of deflection between predetermined settings (e.g. along a predefined scanning route) or otherwise. With respect the use of light deflectors in LIDAR systems, it is noted that a light deflector may be used in the outbound direction (also referred to as transmission direction, or TX) to deflect light from the light source to at least a part of the field of view. However, a light deflector may also be used in the inbound direction (also referred to as reception direction, or RX) to deflect light from at least a part of the field of view to one or more light sensors. Additional details on the scanning unit and the at least one light deflector are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Disclosed embodiments may involve pivoting the light deflector in order to scan the field of view. As used herein the term &#x201c;pivoting&#x201d; broadly includes rotating of an object (especially a solid object) about one or more axis of rotation, while substantially maintaining a center of rotation fixed. In one embodiment, the pivoting of the light deflector may include rotation of the light deflector about a fixed axis (e.g., a shaft), but this is not necessarily so. For example, in some MEMS mirror implementation, the MEMS mirror may move by actuation of a plurality of benders connected to the mirror, the mirror may experience some spatial translation in addition to rotation. Nevertheless, such mirror may be designed to rotate about a substantially fixed axis, and therefore consistent with the present disclosure it considered to be pivoted. In other embodiments, some types of light deflectors (e.g. non-mechanical-electro-optical beam steering, OPA) do not require any moving components or internal movements in order to change the deflection angles of deflected light. It is noted that any discussion relating to moving or pivoting a light deflector is also mutatis mutandis applicable to controlling the light deflector such that it changes a deflection behavior of the light deflector. For example, controlling the light deflector may cause a change in a deflection angle of beams of light arriving from at least one direction.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Disclosed embodiments may involve receiving reflections associated with a portion of the field of view corresponding to a single instantaneous position of the light deflector. As used herein, the term &#x201c;instantaneous position of the light deflector&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;state of the light deflector&#x201d;) broadly refers to the location or position in space where at least one controlled component of the light deflector is situated at an instantaneous point in time, or over a short span of time. In one embodiment, the instantaneous position of light deflector may be gauged with respect to a frame of reference. The frame of reference may pertain to at least one fixed point in the LIDAR system. Or, for example, the frame of reference may pertain to at least one fixed point in the scene. In some embodiments, the instantaneous position of the light deflector may include some movement of one or more components of the light deflector (e.g. mirror, prism), usually to a limited degree with respect to the maximal degree of change during a scanning of the field of view. For example, a scanning of the entire the field of view of the LIDAR system may include changing deflection of light over a span of 30&#xb0;, and the instantaneous position of the at least one light deflector may include angular shifts of the light deflector within 0.05&#xb0;. In other embodiments, the term &#x201c;instantaneous position of the light deflector&#x201d; may refer to the positions of the light deflector during acquisition of light which is processed to provide data for a single point of a point cloud (or another type of 3D model) generated by the LIDAR system. In some embodiments, an instantaneous position of the light deflector may correspond with a fixed position or orientation in which the deflector pauses for a short time during illumination of a particular sub-region of the LIDAR field of view. In other cases, an instantaneous position of the light deflector may correspond with a certain position/orientation along a scanned range of positions/orientations of the light deflector that the light deflector passes through as part of a continuous or semi-continuous scan of the LIDAR field of view. In some embodiments, the light deflector may be moved such that during a scanning cycle of the LIDAR FOV the light deflector is located at a plurality of different instantaneous positions. In other words, during the period of time in which a scanning cycle occurs, the deflector may be moved through a series of different instantaneous positions/orientations, and the deflector may reach each different instantaneous position/orientation at a different time during the scanning cycle.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the LIDAR<sub>system </sub>may include at least one sensing unit with at least one sensor configured to detect reflections from objects in the field of view. The term &#x201c;sensor&#x201d; broadly includes any device, element, or system capable of measuring properties (e.g., power, frequency, phase, pulse timing, pulse duration) of electromagnetic waves and to generate an output relating to the measured properties. In some embodiments, the at least one sensor may include a plurality of detectors constructed from a plurality of detecting elements. The at least one sensor may include light sensors of one or more types. It is noted that the at least one sensor may include multiple sensors of the same type which may differ in other characteristics (e.g., sensitivity, size). Other types of sensors may also be used. Combinations of several types of sensors can be used for different reasons, such as improving detection over a span of ranges (especially in close range); improving the dynamic range of the sensor; improving the temporal response of the sensor; and improving detection in varying environmental conditions (e.g. atmospheric temperature, rain, etc.). In one embodiment, the at least one sensor includes a SiPM (Silicon photomultipliers) which is a solid-state single-photon-sensitive device built from an array of avalanche photodiode (APD), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), serving as detection elements on a common silicon substrate. In one example, a typical distance between SPADs may be between about 10 m and about 50 m, wherein each SPAD may have a recovery time of between about 20 ns and about 100 ns. Similar photomultipliers from other, non-silicon materials may also be used. Although a SiPM device works in digital/switching mode, the SiPM is an analog device because all the microcells may be read in parallel, making it possible to generate signals within a dynamic range from a single photon to hundreds and thousands of photons detected by the different SPADs. It is noted that outputs from different types of sensors (e.g., SPAD, APD, SiPM, PIN diode, Photodetector) may be combined together to a single output which may be processed by a processor of the LIDAR system.

In some cases, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may capture a complete surround view of the environment of vehicle <b>110</b>. Thus, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may have a 360-degree horizontal field of view.

The term &#x201c;bi-static configuration&#x201d; broadly refers to LIDAR systems configurations in which the projected light exiting the LIDAR system and the reflected light entering the LIDAR system pass through substantially different optical paths. In some embodiments, a bi-static configuration of LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include a separation of the optical paths by using completely different optical components, by using parallel but not fully separated optical components, or by using the same optical components for only part of the of the optical paths (optical components may include, for example, windows, lenses, mirrors, beam splitters, etc.). In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the bi-static configuration includes a configuration where the outbound light and the inbound light pass through a single optical window <b>124</b> but scanning unit <b>104</b> includes two light deflectors, a first light deflector <b>114</b>A for outbound light and a second light deflector <b>114</b>B for inbound light (the inbound light in LIDAR system includes emitted light reflected from objects in the scene, and may also include ambient light arriving from other sources).

In all the example configurations above, the inbound and outbound optical paths differ from one another.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">In this embodiment, all the components of LIDAR system <b>100</b> may be contained within a single housing <b>200</b>, or may be divided among a plurality of housings. As shown, projecting unit <b>102</b> is associated with a single light source <b>112</b> that includes a laser diode <b>202</b>A (or two or more laser diodes coupled together) configured to emit light (projected light <b>204</b>). In one non-limiting example, the light projected by light source <b>112</b> may be at a wavelength between about 800 nm and 950 nm, have an average power between about 50 mW and about 500 mW, have a peak power between about 50 W and about 200 W, and a pulse width of between about 2 ns and about 100 ns. In addition, light source <b>112</b> may optionally be associated with optical assembly <b>202</b>B used for manipulation of the light emitted by laser diode <b>202</b>A (e.g. for collimation, focusing, etc.). It is noted that other types of light sources <b>112</b> may be used, and that the disclosure is not restricted to laser diodes. In addition, light source <b>112</b> may emit its light in different formats, such as light pulses, frequency modulated, continuous wave (CW), quasi-CW, or any other form corresponding to the particular light source employed. The projection format and other parameters may be changed by the light source from time to time based on different factors, such as instructions from processing unit <b>108</b>. The projected light is projected towards an outbound deflector <b>114</b>A that functions as a steering element for directing the projected light in field of view <b>120</b>. In this example, scanning unit <b>104</b> may also include a pivotable return deflector <b>114</b>B that directs photons (reflected light <b>206</b>) reflected back from an object <b>208</b> within field of view <b>120</b> toward sensor <b>116</b>. The reflected light is detected by sensor <b>116</b> and information about the object (e.g., the distance to object <b>212</b>) is determined by processing unit <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">In this figure, LIDAR system <b>100</b> is connected to a host <b>210</b>. Consistent with the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;host&#x201d; refers to any computing environment that may interface with LIDAR system <b>100</b>, it may be a vehicle system (e.g., part of vehicle <b>110</b>), a testing system, a security system, a surveillance system, a traffic control system, an urban modelling system, or any system that monitors its surroundings. Such a computing environment may include at least one processor and/or may be connected to LIDAR system <b>100</b> via the cloud. In some embodiments, host <b>210</b> may also include interfaces to external devices such as a camera and sensors configured to measure different characteristics of host <b>210</b> (e.g., acceleration, steering wheel deflection, reverse drive, etc.). Consistent with the present disclosure, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may be fixed to a stationary object associated with host <b>210</b> (e.g. a building, a tripod) or to a portable system associated with host <b>210</b> (e.g., a portable computer, a movie camera).

Specifically, host <b>210</b> may use LIDAR system <b>100</b> to aid in detecting and scanning the environment of host <b>210</b> or any other environment. In addition, host <b>210</b> may integrate, synchronize or otherwise use together the outputs of LIDAR system <b>100</b> with outputs of other sensing systems (e.g. cameras, microphones, radar systems). In one example, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may be used by a security system.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">LIDAR system <b>100</b> may also include a bus <b>212</b> (or other communication mechanisms) that interconnect subsystems and components for transferring information within LIDAR system <b>100</b>.

In other words, processing unit <b>108</b> may be configured to dynamically operate LIDAR system <b>100</b> in a closed loop. A closed loop system is characterized by having feedback from at least one of the elements and updating one or more parameters based on the received feedback. Moreover, a closed loop system may receive feedback and update its own operation, at least partially, based on that feedback. A dynamic system or element is one that may be updated during operation.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">According to some embodiments, scanning the environment around LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include illuminating field of view <b>120</b> with light pulses. The light pulses may have parameters such as: pulse duration, pulse angular dispersion, wavelength, instantaneous power, photon density at different distances from light source <b>112</b>, average power, pulse power intensity, pulse width, pulse repetition rate, pulse sequence, pulse duty cycle, wavelength, phase, polarization, and more. Scanning the environment around LIDAR system <b>100</b> may also include detecting and characterizing various aspects of the reflected light. Characteristics of the reflected light may include, for example: time-of-flight (i.e., time from emission until detection), instantaneous power (e.g., power signature), average power across entire return pulse, and photon distribution/signal over return pulse period. By comparing characteristics of a light pulse with characteristics of corresponding reflections, a distance and possibly a physical characteristic, such as reflected intensity of object <b>212</b> may be estimated. By repeating this process across multiple adjacent portions <b>122</b>, in a predefined pattern (e.g., raster, Lissajous or other patterns) an entire scan of field of view <b>120</b> may be achieved. As discussed below in greater detail, in some situations LIDAR system <b>100</b> may direct light to only some of the portions <b>122</b> in field of view <b>120</b> at every scanning cycle. These portions may be adjacent to each other, but not necessarily so.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">In another embodiment, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include network interface <b>214</b> for communicating with host <b>210</b> (e.g., a vehicle controller). The communication between LIDAR system <b>100</b> and host <b>210</b> is represented by a dashed arrow. In one embodiment, network interface <b>214</b> may include an integrated service digital network (ISDN) card, cable modem, satellite modem, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, network interface <b>214</b> may include a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. In another embodiment, network interface <b>214</b> may include an Ethernet port connected to radio frequency receivers and transmitters and/or optical (e.g., infrared) receivers and transmitters. The specific design and implementation of network interface <b>214</b> depends on the communications network(s) over which LIDAR system <b>100</b> and host <b>210</b> are intended to operate. For example, network interface <b>214</b> may be used, for example, to provide outputs of LIDAR system <b>100</b> to the external system, such as a 3D model, operational parameters of LIDAR system <b>100</b>, and so on. In other embodiment, the communication unit may be used, for example, to receive instructions from the external system, to receive information regarding the inspected environment, to receive information from another sensor, etc.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of a monostatic configuration of LIDAR system <b>100</b> including a plurality projecting units <b>102</b>. The term &#x201c;monostatic configuration&#x201d; broadly refers to LIDAR system configurations in which the projected light exiting from the LIDAR system and the reflected light entering the LIDAR system pass through substantially similar optical paths. In one example, the outbound light beam and the inbound light beam may share at least one optical assembly through which both outbound and inbound light beams pass. In another example, the outbound light may pass through an optical window (not shown) and the inbound light radiation may pass through the same optical window. A monostatic configuration may include a configuration where the scanning unit <b>104</b> includes a single light deflector <b>114</b> that directs the projected light towards field of view <b>120</b> and directs the reflected light towards a sensor <b>116</b>. As shown, both projected light <b>204</b> and reflected light <b>206</b> hits an asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b>. The term &#x201c;asymmetrical deflector&#x201d; refers to any optical device having two sides capable of deflecting a beam of light hitting it from one side in a different direction than it deflects a beam of light hitting it from the second side. In one example, the asymmetrical deflector does not deflect projected light <b>204</b> and deflects reflected light <b>206</b> towards sensor <b>116</b>. One example of an asymmetrical deflector may include a polarization beam splitter. In another example, asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> may include an optical isolator that allows the passage of light in only one direction. A diagrammatic representation of asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. Consistent with the present disclosure, a monostatic configuration of LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include an asymmetrical deflector to prevent reflected light from hitting light source <b>112</b>, and to direct all the reflected light toward sensor <b>116</b>, thereby increasing detection sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, LIDAR system <b>100</b> includes three projecting units <b>102</b> each with a single light source <b>112</b> aimed at a common light deflector <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, the plurality of light sources <b>112</b> (including two or more light sources) may project light with substantially the same wavelength and each light source <b>112</b> is generally associated with a differing area of the field of view (denoted in the figure as <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B, and <b>120</b>C). This enables scanning of a broader field of view than can be achieved with a light source <b>112</b>. In another embodiment, the plurality of light sources <b>112</b> may project light with differing wavelengths, and all the light sources <b>112</b> may be directed to the same portion (or overlapping portions) of field of view <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates an example of LIDAR system <b>100</b> in which projecting unit <b>102</b> includes a primary light source <b>112</b>A and a secondary light source <b>112</b>B. Primary light source <b>112</b>A may project light with a longer wavelength to which to the human eye is not sensitive in order to optimize SNR and detection range. For example, primary light source <b>112</b>A may project light with a wavelength between about 750 nm and 1100 nm. In contrast, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may project light with a wavelength visible to the human eye. For example, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may project light with a wavelength between about 400 nm and 700 nm. In one embodiment, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may project light along substantially the same optical path as the light projected by primary light source <b>112</b>A. Both light sources may be time-synchronized and may project light emission together or in interleaved pattern. An interleave pattern means that the light sources are not active at the same time which may mitigate mutual interference. A person who is of skill in the art would readily see that other combinations of wavelength ranges and activation schedules may also be implemented.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0160">Consistent with some embodiments, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may cause human eyes to blink when it is too close to the LIDAR optical output port. This may ensure an eye safety mechanism not feasible with typical laser sources that utilize the near-infrared light spectrum. In another embodiment, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may be used for calibration and reliability at a point of service, in a manner somewhat similar to the calibration of headlights with a special reflector/pattern at a certain height from the ground with respect to vehicle <b>110</b>. An operator at a point of service could examine the calibration of the LIDAR by simple visual inspection of the scanned pattern over a featured target such as a test pattern board at a designated distance from LIDAR system <b>100</b>. In addition, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may provide means for operational confidence that the LIDAR is working for the end-user. For example, the system may be configured to permit a human to place a hand in front of light deflector <b>114</b> to test its operation.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0161">Secondary light source <b>112</b>B may also have a non-visible element that can double as a backup system in case primary light source <b>112</b>A fails. This feature may be useful for fail-safe devices with elevated functional safety ratings. Given that secondary light source <b>112</b>B may be visible and also due to reasons of cost and complexity, secondary light source <b>112</b>B may be associated with a smaller power compared to primary light source <b>112</b>A. Therefore, in case of a failure of primary light source <b>112</b>A, the system functionality will rely on the functionalities and capabilities of the secondary light source <b>112</b>B set of functionalities and capabilities. While the capabilities of secondary light source <b>112</b>B may be inferior to the capabilities of primary light source <b>112</b>A, LIDAR system <b>100</b> system may be designed in such a fashion to enable vehicle <b>110</b> to safely arrive at its destination.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> that may be part of LIDAR system <b>100</b>.

While not necessarily so, asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> may optionally be a static deflector. Asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> may be used in a monostatic configuration of LIDAR system <b>100</b>, in order to allow a common optical path for transmission and for reception of light via the at least one deflector <b>114</b>, e.g. as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>. However, typical asymmetrical deflectors such as beam splitters are characterized by energy losses, especially in the reception path, which may be more sensitive to power loses than the transmission path.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0163">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> positioned in the transmission path, which includes one-way deflector <b>220</b> for separating between the transmitted and received light signals. Optionally, one-way deflector <b>220</b> may be substantially transparent to the transmission light and substantially reflective to the received light. The transmitted light is generated by projecting unit <b>102</b> and may travel through one-way deflector <b>220</b> to scanning unit <b>104</b> which deflects it towards the optical outlet. The received light arrives through the optical inlet, to the at least one deflecting element <b>114</b>, which deflects the reflection signal into a separate path away from the light source and towards sensing unit <b>106</b>. Optionally, asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> may be combined with a polarized light source <b>112</b> which is linearly polarized with the same polarization axis as one-way deflector <b>220</b>. Notably, the cross-section of the outbound light beam is much smaller than that of the reflection signals. Accordingly, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may include one or more optical components (e.g. lens, collimator) for focusing or otherwise manipulating the emitted polarized light beam to the dimensions of the asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b>. In one embodiment, one-way deflector <b>220</b> may be a polarizing beam splitter that is virtually transparent to the polarized light beam.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0164">Consistent with some embodiments, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may further include optics <b>222</b> (e.g., a quarter wave plate retarder) for modifying a polarization of the emitted light. For example, optics <b>222</b> may modify a linear polarization of the emitted light beam to circular polarization. Light reflected back to system <b>100</b> from the field of view would arrive back through deflector <b>114</b> to optics <b>222</b>, bearing a circular polarization with a reversed handedness with respect to the transmitted light. Optics <b>222</b> would then convert the received reversed handedness polarization light to a linear polarization that is not on the same axis as that of the polarized beam splitter <b>216</b>. As noted above, the received light-patch is larger than the transmitted light-patch, due to optical dispersion of the beam traversing through the distance to the target.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0165">Some of the received light will impinge on one-way deflector <b>220</b> that will reflect the light towards sensing unit <b>106</b> with some power loss. However, another part of the received patch of light will fall on a reflective surface <b>218</b> which surrounds one-way deflector <b>220</b> (e.g., polarizing beam splitter slit). Reflective surface <b>218</b> will reflect the light towards sensing unit <b>106</b> with substantially zero power loss. One-way deflector <b>220</b> would reflect light that is composed of various polarization axes and directions that will eventually arrive at the detector. Optionally, sensing unit <b>106</b> may include sensor <b>116</b> that is agnostic to the laser polarization, and is primarily sensitive to the amount of impinging photons at a certain wavelength range.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0166">It is noted that the proposed asymmetrical deflector <b>216</b> provides far superior performances when compared to a simple mirror with a passage hole in it. In a mirror with a hole, all of the reflected light which reaches the hole is lost to the detector. However, in deflector <b>216</b>, one-way deflector <b>220</b> deflects a significant portion of that light (e.g., about 50%) toward the respective sensor <b>116</b>. In LIDAR systems, the number photons reaching the LIDAR from remote distances is very limited, and therefore the improvement in photon capture rate is important.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0167">According to some embodiments, a device for beam splitting and steering is described. A polarized beam may be emitted from a light source having a first polarization. The emitted beam may be directed to pass through a polarized beam splitter assembly. The polarized beam splitter assembly includes on a first side a one-directional slit and on an opposing side a mirror. The one-directional slit enables the polarized emitted beam to travel toward a quarter-wave-plate/wave-retarder which changes the emitted signal from a polarized signal to a linear signal (or vice versa) so that subsequently reflected beams cannot travel through the one-directional slit.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> shows an example of a bi-static configuration of LIDAR system <b>100</b> without scanning unit <b>104</b>. In order to illuminate an entire field of view (or substantially the entire field of view) without deflector <b>114</b>, projecting unit <b>102</b> may optionally include an array of light sources (e.g., <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>F). In one embodiment, the array of light sources may include a linear array of light sources controlled by processor <b>118</b>. For example, processor <b>118</b> may cause the linear array of light sources to sequentially project collimated laser beams towards first optional optical window <b>124</b>A. First optional optical window <b>124</b>A may include a diffuser lens for spreading the projected light and sequentially forming wide horizontal and narrow vertical beams. Optionally, some or all of the at least one light source <b>112</b> of system <b>100</b> may project light concurrently. For example, processor <b>118</b> may cause the array of light sources to simultaneously project light beams from a plurality of non-adjacent light sources <b>112</b>.

The light beam from fourth light source <b>112</b>D may reach an object in the field of view.

As shown, scanning unit <b>104</b> may include one or more actuators <b>302</b> (specifically, <b>302</b>A and <b>302</b>B). In one embodiment, actuator <b>302</b> may be made of semiconductor (e.g., silicon) and includes a piezoelectric layer (e.g. PZT, Lead zirconate titanate, aluminum nitride), which changes its dimension in response to electric signals applied by an actuation controller, a semi conductive layer, and a base layer. In one embodiment, the physical properties of actuator <b>302</b> may determine the mechanical stresses that actuator <b>302</b> experiences when electrical current passes through it. When the piezoelectric material is activated it exerts force on actuator <b>302</b> and causes it to bend. In one embodiment, the resistivity of one or more actuators <b>302</b> may be measured in an active state (Ractive) when mirror <b>300</b> is deflected at a certain angular position and compared to the resistivity at a resting state (Rrest).

Consistent with some embodiments, a dual axis MEMS mirror may be configured to deflect light in a horizontal direction and in a vertical direction. For example, the angles of deflection of a dual axis MEMS mirror may be between about 0&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; in the vertical direction and between about 0&#xb0; to 50&#xb0; in the horizontal direction.

In one embodiment, implementing light deflector <b>114</b> as a group of smaller individual light deflectors working in synchronization may allow light deflector <b>114</b> to perform at a high scan rate with larger angles of deflection. The deflector array may essentially act as a large light deflector (e.g. a large mirror) in terms of effective area.

For example, reflector array <b>312</b> may be a part of an outbound path of light projected from light source <b>112</b>. Specifically, reflector array <b>312</b> may direct projected light <b>204</b> towards a portion of field of view <b>120</b>. Reflector array <b>312</b> may also be part of a return path for light reflected from a surface of an object located within an illumined portion of field of view <b>120</b>.

Consistent with the present disclosure, increasing the number of TX Mirrors may increase a reflected photons beam spread. Additionally, decreasing the number of RX Mirrors may narrow the reception field and compensate for ambient light conditions (such as clouds, rain, fog, extreme heat, and other environmental conditions) and improve the signal to noise ratio. Also, as indicated above, the emitted light beam is typically narrower than the patch of reflected light, and therefore can be fully deflected by a small portion of the deflection array. Moreover, it is possible to block light reflected from the portion of the deflection array used for transmission (e.g. the TX mirror) from reaching sensor <b>116</b>, thereby reducing an effect of internal reflections of the LIDAR system <b>100</b> on system operation. In addition, at least one processor <b>118</b> may pivot one or more reflector units <b>314</b> to overcome mechanical impairments and drifts due, for example, to thermal and gain effects.

Objects <b>208</b> may be a solid object (e.g. a road, a tree, a car, a person), fluid object (e.g. fog, water, atmosphere particles), or object of another type (e.g. dust or a powdery illuminated object). When the photons emitted from light source <b>112</b> hit object <b>208</b> they either reflect, refract, or get absorbed. Typically, as shown in the figure, only a portion of the photons reflected from object <b>208</b>A enters optional optical window <b>124</b>. As each &#x2dc;15 cm change in distance results in a travel time difference of 1 ns (since the photons travel at the speed of light to and from object <b>208</b>), the time differences between the travel times of different photons hitting the different objects may be detectable by a time-of-flight sensor with sufficiently quick response.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0185">Sensor <b>116</b> includes a plurality of detection elements <b>402</b> for detecting photons of a photonic pulse reflected back from field of view <b>120</b>. The detection elements may all be included in detector array <b>400</b>, which may have a rectangular arrangement (e.g. as shown) or any other arrangement. Detection elements <b>402</b> may operate concurrently or partially concurrently with each other. Specifically, each detection element <b>402</b> may issue detection information for every sampling duration (e.g. every 1 nanosecond). In one example, detector array <b>400</b> may be a SiPM (Silicon photomultipliers) which is a solid-state single-photon-sensitive device built from an array of single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs, serving as detection elements <b>402</b>) on a common silicon substrate. Similar photomultipliers from other, non-silicon materials may also be used. Although a SiPM device works in digital/switching mode, the SiPM is an analog device because all the microcells are read in parallel, making it possible to generate signals within a dynamic range from a single photon to hundreds and thousands of photons detected by the different SPADs. As mentioned above, more than one type of sensor may be implemented (e.g. SiPM and APD). Possibly, sensing unit <b>106</b> may include at least one APD integrated into an SiPM array and/or at least one APD detector located next to a SiPM on a separate or common silicon substrate.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">In one embodiment, detection elements <b>402</b> may be grouped into a plurality of regions <b>404</b>.

The illustrated part of sensor <b>116</b> includes a part of a detector array <b>400</b> which includes four detection elements <b>402</b> (e.g., four SPADs, four APDs). Detector array <b>400</b> may be a photodetector sensor realized in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). Each of the detection elements <b>402</b> has a sensitive area, which is positioned within a substrate surrounding. While not necessarily so, sensor <b>116</b> may be used in a monostatic LiDAR system having a narrow field of view (e.g., because scanning unit <b>104</b> scans different parts of the field of view at different times). The narrow field of view for the incoming light beam&#x2014;if implemented&#x2014;eliminates the problem of out-of-focus imaging. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, sensor <b>116</b> may include a plurality of lenses <b>422</b> (e.g., microlenses), each lens <b>422</b> may direct incident light toward a different detection element <b>402</b> (e.g., toward an active area of detection element <b>402</b>), which may be usable when out-of-focus imaging is not an issue. Lenses <b>422</b> may be used for increasing an optical fill factor and sensitivity of detector array <b>400</b>, because most of the light that reaches sensor <b>116</b> may be deflected toward the active areas of detection elements <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0197">Detector array <b>400</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, may include several layers built into the silicon substrate by various methods (e.g., implant) resulting in a sensitive area, contact elements to the metal layers and isolation elements (e.g., shallow trench implant STI, guard rings, optical trenches, etc.). The sensitive area may be a volumetric element in the CMOS detector that enables the optical conversion of incoming photons into a current flow given an adequate voltage bias is applied to the device. In the case of a APD/SPAD, the sensitive area would be a combination of an electrical field that pulls electrons created by photon absorption towards a multiplication area where a photon induced electron is amplified creating a breakdown avalanche of multiplied electrons.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0198">A front side illuminated detector (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>) has the input optical port at the same side as the metal layers residing on top of the semiconductor (Silicon). The metal layers are required to realize the electrical connections of each individual photodetector element (e.g., anode and cathode) with various elements such as: bias voltage, quenching/ballast elements, and other photodetectors in a common array. The optical port through which the photons impinge upon the detector sensitive area is comprised of a passage through the metal layer. It is noted that passage of light from some directions through this passage may be blocked by one or more metal layers (e.g., metal layer ML6, as illustrated for the leftmost detector elements <b>402</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). Such blockage reduces the total optical light absorbing efficiency of the detector.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> illustrates three detection elements <b>402</b>, each with an associated lens <b>422</b>, in accordance with examples of the presently disclosed subject matter. Each of the three detection elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, denoted <b>402</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>402</b>(<b>2</b>), and <b>402</b>(<b>3</b>), illustrates a lens configuration which may be implemented in associated with one or more of the detecting elements <b>402</b> of sensor <b>116</b>. It is noted that combinations of these lens configurations may also be implemented.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0200">In the lens configuration illustrated with regards to detection element <b>402</b>(<b>1</b>), a focal point of the associated lens <b>422</b> may be located above the semiconductor surface. Optionally, openings in different metal layers of the detection element may have different sizes aligned with the cone of focusing light generated by the associated lens <b>422</b>. Such a structure may improve the signal-to-noise and resolution of the array <b>400</b> as a whole device. Large metal layers may be important for delivery of power and ground shielding. This approach may be useful, e.g., with a monostatic LiDAR design with a narrow field of view where the incoming light beam is comprised of parallel rays and the imaging focus does not have any consequence to the detected signal.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0201">In the lens configuration illustrated with regards to detection element <b>402</b>(<b>2</b>), an efficiency of photon detection by the detection elements <b>402</b> may be improved by identifying a sweet spot. Specifically, a photodetector implemented in CMOS may have a sweet spot in the sensitive volume area where the probability of a photon creating an avalanche effect is the highest. Therefore, a focal point of lens <b>422</b> may be positioned inside the sensitive volume area at the sweet spot location, as demonstrated by detection elements <b>402</b>(<b>2</b>). The lens shape and distance from the focal point may take into account the refractive indices of all the elements the laser beam is passing along the way from the lens to the sensitive sweet spot location buried in the semiconductor material.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0202">In the lens configuration illustrated with regards to the detection element on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, an efficiency of photon absorption in the semiconductor material may be improved using a diffuser and reflective elements. Specifically, a near IR wavelength requires a significantly long path of silicon material in order to achieve a high probability of absorbing a photon that travels through. In a typical lens configuration, a photon may traverse the sensitive area and may not be absorbed into a detectable electron. A long absorption path that improves the probability for a photon to create an electron renders the size of the sensitive area towards less practical dimensions (tens of um for example) for a CMOS device fabricated with typical foundry processes. The rightmost detector element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> demonstrates a technique for processing incoming photons. The associated lens <b>422</b> focuses the incoming light onto a diffuser element <b>424</b>. In one embodiment, light sensor <b>116</b> may further include a diffuser located in the gap distant from the outer surface of at least some of the detectors. For example, diffuser <b>424</b> may steer the light beam sideways (e.g., as perpendicular as possible) towards the sensitive area and the reflective optical trenches <b>426</b>. The diffuser is located at the focal point, above the focal point, or below the focal point. In this embodiment, the incoming light may be focused on a specific location where a diffuser element is located. Optionally, detector element <b>422</b> is designed to optically avoid the inactive areas where a photon induced electron may get lost and reduce the effective detection efficiency. Reflective optical trenches <b>426</b> (or other forms of optically reflective structures) cause the photons to bounce back and forth across the sensitive area, thus increasing the likelihood of detection. Ideally, the photons will get trapped in a cavity consisting of the sensitive area and the reflective trenches indefinitely until the photon is absorbed and creates an electron/hole pair.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0203">Consistent with the present disclosure, a long path is created for the impinging photons to be absorbed and contribute to a higher probability of detection. Optical trenches may also be implemented in detecting element <b>422</b> for reducing cross talk effects of parasitic photons created during an avalanche that may leak to other detectors and cause false detection events. According to some embodiments, a photo detector array may be optimized so that a higher yield of the received signal is utilized, meaning, that as much of the received signal is received and less of the signal is lost to internal degradation of the signal. The photo detector array may be improved by: (a) moving the focal point at a location above the semiconductor surface, optionally by designing the metal layers above the substrate appropriately; (b) steering the focal point to the most responsive/sensitive area (or &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d;) of the substrate and (c) adding a diffuser above the substrate to steer the signal toward the &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d; and/or adding reflective material to the trenches so that deflected signals are reflected back to the &#x201c;sweet spot.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0206" num="0204">While in some lens configurations, lens <b>422</b> may be positioned so that its focal point is above a center of the corresponding detection element <b>402</b>, it is noted that this is not necessarily so. In other lens configuration, a position of the focal point of the lens <b>422</b> with respect to a center of the corresponding detection element <b>402</b> is shifted based on a distance of the respective detection element <b>402</b> from a center of the detection array <b>400</b>. This may be useful in relatively larger detection arrays <b>400</b>, in which detector elements further from the center receive light in angles which are increasingly off-axis. Shifting the location of the focal points (e.g., toward the center of detection array <b>400</b>) allows correcting for the incidence angles. Specifically, shifting the location of the focal points (e.g., toward the center of detection array <b>400</b>) allows correcting for the incidence angles while using substantially identical lenses <b>422</b> for all detection elements, which are positioned at the same angle with respect to a surface of the detector.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0205">Adding an array of lenses <b>422</b> to an array of detection elements <b>402</b> may be useful when using a relatively small sensor <b>116</b> which covers only a small part of the field of view because in such a case, the reflection signals from the scene reach the detectors array <b>400</b> from substantially the same angle, and it is, therefore, easy to focus all the light onto individual detectors. It is also noted, that in one embodiment, lenses <b>422</b> may be used in LIDAR system <b>100</b> to prioritize the overall probability of detection of the entire array <b>400</b> (preventing photons from being &#x201c;wasted&#x201d; in the dead area between detectors/sub-detectors) at the expense of spatial distinctiveness. This embodiment is in contrast to prior art implementations such as a CMOS RGB camera, which prioritize spatial distinctiveness (i.e., light that propagates in the direction of detection element A is not allowed to be directed by the lens toward detection element B, that is, to &#x201c;bleed&#x201d; to another detection element of the array). Optionally, sensor <b>116</b> includes an array of lenses <b>422</b>, each being correlated to a corresponding detection element <b>402</b>, while at least one of the lenses <b>422</b> deflects light which propagates to a first detection element <b>402</b> toward a second detection element <b>402</b> (thereby it may increase the overall probability of detection of the entire array).</p><p id="p-0208" num="0206">Specifically, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure, light sensor <b>116</b> may include an array of light detectors (e.g., detector array <b>400</b>), each light detector (e.g., detector <b>410</b>) being configured to cause an electric current to flow when light passes through an outer surface of a respective detector.

In one embodiment, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may be operable to generate depth maps of one or more different types, such as any one or more of the following types: point cloud model, polygon mesh, depth image (holding depth information for each pixel of an image or of a 2D array), or any other type of 3D model of a scene. The sequence of depth maps may be a temporal sequence, in which different depth maps are generated at a different time. Each depth map of the sequence associated with a scanning cycle (interchangeably &#x201c;frame&#x201d;) may be generated within the duration of a corresponding subsequent frame-time. In one example, a typical frame-time may last less than a second. In some embodiments, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may have a fixed frame rate (e.g. 10 frames per second, 25 frames per second, 50 frames per second) or the frame rate may be dynamic. In other embodiments, the frame-times of different frames may not be identical across the sequence. For example, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may implement a 10 frames-per-second rate that includes generating a first depth map in 100 milliseconds (the average), a second frame in 92 milliseconds, a third frame at 142 milliseconds, and so on.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0215">In Diagram C, processor <b>118</b> may control the operation of light source <b>112</b> in a manner such that during scanning of field of view <b>120</b> light pulses associated with different durations are projected towards a single portion <b>122</b> of field of view <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, LIDAR system <b>100</b> may be operable to generate a different number of pulses in each frame. The number of pulses may vary between 0 to 32 pulses (e.g., 1, 5, 12, 28, or more pulses) and may be based on information derived from previous emissions. The time between light pulses may depend on desired detection range and can be between 500 ns and 5000 ns. In one example, processing unit <b>108</b> may receive from sensor <b>116</b> information about reflections associated with each light-pulse.

It is noted that the durations of the processing times and the emission times in diagrams A-D are not in-scale. Specifically, the processing time may be substantially longer than the emission time. In diagram D, projecting unit <b>102</b> may include a continuous-wave light source. In one embodiment, the initial light emission may include a period of time where light is emitted and the subsequent emission may be a continuation of the initial emission, or there may be a discontinuity.

In other words, processor <b>118</b> may control the emission of light to allow differentiation in the illumination of different portions of field of view <b>120</b>. In one example, processor <b>118</b> may determine the emission pattern for a single portion <b>122</b> of field of view <b>120</b>, based on detection of reflected light from the same scanning cycle (e.g., the initial emission), which makes LIDAR system <b>100</b> extremely dynamic. In another example, processor <b>118</b> may determine the emission pattern for a single portion <b>122</b> of field of view <b>120</b>, based on detection of reflected light from a previous scanning cycle. The differences in the patterns of the subsequent emissions may result from determining different values for light-source parameters for the subsequent emission, such as any one of the following:</p><p id="p-0219" num="0000">a.

In one example, it is possible to limit emitted power levels in one portion of field of view <b>120</b> where safety is a consideration, while emitting higher power levels (thus improving signal-to-noise ratio and detection range) for other portions of field of view <b>120</b>. This is relevant for eye safety, but may also be relevant for skin safety, safety of optical systems, safety of sensitive materials, and more. In another example, it is possible to direct more energy towards portions of field of view <b>120</b> where it will be of greater use (e.g. regions of interest, further distanced targets, low reflection targets, etc.) while limiting the lighting energy to other portions of field of view <b>120</b> based on detection results from the same frame or previous frame. It is noted that processing unit <b>108</b> may process detected signals from a single instantaneous field of view several times within a single scanning frame time; for example, subsequent emission may be determined after each pulse emission, or after a number of pulse emissions.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates three examples of emission schemes in a single frame-time for field of view <b>120</b>. Consistent with embodiments of the present disclosure, at least on processing unit <b>108</b> may use obtained information to dynamically adjust the operational mode of LIDAR system <b>100</b> and/or determine values of parameters of specific components of LIDAR system <b>100</b>. The obtained information may be determined from processing data captured in field of view <b>120</b>, or received (directly or indirectly) from host <b>210</b>.

The obtained information may include a current light condition, a current weather condition, a current driving environment of the host vehicle, a current location of the host vehicle, a current trajectory of the host vehicle, a current topography of road surrounding the host vehicle, or any other condition or object detectable through light reflection. In some embodiments, the determined scanning scheme may include at least one of the following: (a) a designation of portions within field of view <b>120</b> to be actively scanned as part of a scanning cycle, (b) a projecting plan for projecting unit <b>102</b> that defines the light emission profile at different portions of field of view <b>120</b>; (c) a deflecting plan for scanning unit <b>104</b> that defines, for example, a deflection direction, frequency, and designating idle elements within a reflector array; and (d) a detection plan for sensing unit <b>106</b> that defines the detectors sensitivity or responsivity pattern.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0219">In addition, processing unit <b>108</b> may determine the scanning scheme at least partially by obtaining an identification of at least one region of interest within the field of view <b>120</b> and at least one region of non-interest within the field of view <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, processing unit <b>108</b> may determine the scanning scheme at least partially by obtaining an identification of at least one region of high interest within the field of view <b>120</b> and at least one region of lower-interest within the field of view <b>120</b>. The identification of the at least one region of interest within the field of view <b>120</b> may be determined, for example, from processing data captured in field of view <b>120</b>, based on data of another sensor (e.g. camera, GPS), received (directly or indirectly) from host <b>210</b>, or any combination of the above. In some embodiments, the identification of at least one region of interest may include identification of portions, areas, sections, pixels, or objects within field of view <b>120</b> that are important to monitor. Examples of areas that may be identified as regions of interest may include crosswalks, moving objects, people, nearby vehicles or any other environmental condition or object that may be helpful in vehicle navigation. Examples of areas that may be identified as regions of non-interest (or lower-interest) may be static (non-moving) far-away buildings, a skyline, an area above the horizon and objects in the field of view. Upon obtaining the identification of at least one region of interest within the field of view <b>120</b>, processing unit <b>108</b> may determine the scanning scheme or change an existing scanning scheme. Further to determining or changing the light-source parameters (as described above), processing unit <b>108</b> may allocate detector resources based on the identification of the at least one region of interest.

In another example, processing unit <b>108</b> may change the detector sensitivity, e.g., increasing sensor sensitivity for long range detection where the reflected power is low.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0220">Diagrams A-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depict examples of different scanning schemes for scanning field of view <b>120</b>. Each square in field of view <b>120</b> represents a different portion <b>122</b> associated with an instantaneous position of at least one light deflector <b>114</b>. Legend <b>500</b> details the level of light flux represented by the filling pattern of the squares. Diagram A depicts a first scanning scheme in which all of the portions have the same importance/priority and a default light flux is allocated to them. The first scanning scheme may be utilized in a start-up phase or periodically interleaved with another scanning scheme to monitor the whole field of view for unexpected/new objects. In one example, the light source parameters in the first scanning scheme may be configured to generate light pulses at constant amplitudes. Diagram B depicts a second scanning scheme in which a portion of field of view <b>120</b> is allocated with high light flux while the rest of field of view <b>120</b> is allocated with default light flux and low light flux. The portions of field of view <b>120</b> that are the least interesting may be allocated with low light flux. Diagram C depicts a third scanning scheme in which a compact vehicle and a bus (see silhouettes) are identified in field of view <b>120</b>. In this scanning scheme, the edges of the vehicle and bus may be tracked with high power and the central mass of the vehicle and bus may be allocated with less light flux (or no light flux). Such light flux allocation enables concentration of more of the optical budget on the edges of the identified objects and less on their center which have less importance.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrating the emission of light towards field of view <b>120</b> during a single scanning cycle. In the depicted example, field of view <b>120</b> is represented by an 8&#xd7;9 matrix, where each of the 72 cells corresponds to a separate portion <b>122</b> associated with a different instantaneous position of at least one light deflector <b>114</b>. In this exemplary scanning cycle, each portion includes one or more white dots that represent the number of light pulses projected toward that portion, and some portions include black dots that represent reflected light from that portion detected by sensor <b>116</b>. As shown, field of view <b>120</b> is divided into three sectors: sector I on the right side of field of view <b>120</b>, sector II in the middle of field of view <b>120</b>, and sector III on the left side of field of view <b>120</b>. In this exemplary scanning cycle, sector I was initially allocated with a single light pulse per portion; sector II, previously identified as a region of interest, was initially allocated with three light pulses per portion; and sector III was initially allocated with two light pulses per portion. Also as shown, scanning of field of view <b>120</b> reveals four objects <b>208</b>: two free-form objects in the near field (e.g., between 5 and 50 meters), a rounded-square object in the mid field (e.g., between 50 and 150 meters), and a triangle object in the far field (e.g., between 150 and 500 meters). While the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> uses number of pulses as an example of light flux allocation, it is noted that light flux allocation to different parts of the field of view may also be implemented in other ways such as: pulse duration, pulse angular dispersion, wavelength, instantaneous power, photon density at different distances from light source <b>112</b>, average power, pulse power intensity, pulse width, pulse repetition rate, pulse sequence, pulse duty cycle, wavelength, phase, polarization, and more. The illustration of the light emission as a single scanning cycle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> demonstrates different capabilities of LIDAR system <b>100</b>. In a first embodiment, processor <b>118</b> is configured to use two light pulses to detect a first object (e.g., the rounded-square object) at a first distance, and to use three light pulses to detect a second object (e.g., the triangle object) at a second distance greater than the first distance. In a second embodiment, processor <b>118</b> is configured to allocate more light to portions of the field of view where a region of interest is identified. Specifically, in the present example, sector II was identified as a region of interest and accordingly it was allocated with three light pulses while the rest of field of view <b>120</b> was allocated with two or less light pulses. In a third embodiment, processor <b>118</b> is configured to control light source <b>112</b> in a manner such that only a single light pulse is projected toward to portions B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and C<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, although they are part of sector III that was initially allocated with two light pulses per portion. This occurs because the processing unit <b>108</b> detected an object in the near field based on the first light pulse. Allocation of less than maximal amount of pulses may also be a result of other considerations. For example, in at least some regions, detection of object at a first distance (e.g. a near field object) may result in reducing an overall amount of light emitted to this portion of field of view <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0222">Additional details and examples on different components of LIDAR system <b>100</b> and their associated functionalities are included in Applicant's U.S. patent application Ser.

In some cases, as discussed, the scanner may include one or more MEMs mirrors. MEMs scanners offer many desirable properties, especially with respect to certain applications. In some cases, however, MEMs scanners may be associated with challenges. For example, in some applications, it may be desirable to increase an aperture size (e.g., to enable scanning over a larger FOV) by increasing the size of the MEMs scanning mirror(s). Increasing the MEMs mirror size, however, increases the mass and inertia of the mirror system and, in many cases, may overwhelm the capabilities of the MEMs actuators (e.g., bender arms, couplers, etc.). Rather than increasing the size of a MEMs scanning mirror to increase the LIDAR aperture/FOV, the number of MEMs scanning mirrors in the scanning system may also be increased (e.g., a mirror for the Tx channel and two or more mirrors for the Rx channel, among other configurations). Such solutions, however, increase the number of moving parts (e.g., mirrors, actuators, etc.), especially where each scanning mirror includes multiple actuators for scanning in more than one dimension. The increases in number of parts leads to more complexity, for example, in coordinating the control of the individual scanning mirrors, developing suitable light projection systems, and developing suitable detector configurations to function with a multi-mirror scanning system. MEMs scanning systems also include volatile materials used in the actuators and require hermetic sealing. The additional parts and complexity can significantly increase system cost&#x2014;an attribute not desirable in most industries, but especially in the vehicle manufacturing industry where cost sensitivity is acute. The added complexity (and sealing requirements) may also impact reliability&#x2014;another attribute especially important in many industries.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0224">Other scanning systems may include galvo scanners to rotate a scanning mirror in a LIDAR system. Each galvo scanner includes a galvo motor configured to rotate a shaft or other linkage about a single axis. Therefore, in order to rotate a mirror about two axes to provide a two-dimensional scan of a LIDAR FOV, two galvo motors would be needed. Such systems offer their own challenges. Galvo motors are large, especially in relation to other LIDAR mirror scanning solutions. They require more power than other solutions to provide desired mirror scanning rates and, as a result, generate more heat, which can be difficult to dissipate. Galvo motor scanners may also be unsuitable for multi-laser sources projected on a scanning mirror at different incident angles.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0225">In some embodiments, a LIDAR scanning system may include a mirror rotated with one or more actuators including a magnet and an electrically conductive coil. Such actuators, may include voice coil actuators (magnetic motors) configured to rotate a shaft or linkage about a central axis (rotary voice coil actuator) or move a shaft or linkage back and forth (linear voice coil actuator). Generally, voice coils operate based on an application of the Lorentz force, which is results from point charges moving in coils of wire, for example, in the presence of magnetic flux lines. The cross product of the point charge motion vector, having a direction determined by the current in the coil, and the magnetic field vector results in a force perpendicular to both. The direction of the force can be reversed by reversing the direction of the current in the coil, which is a technique used, e.g., in voice coil actuators including permanent magnets.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0226">The disclosed LIDAR scanning system may include magnet and coil based actuators to rotate a mirror in two axes to enable biaxial scanning. For example, the scanning mirror oscillation may be driven by a conductive coil positioned in a magnetic field. The coil can be directly or indirectly coupled to the mirror. Based on the Lorentz force principle, when a driving signal is applied to the coil, inducing a current, the coil is urged in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and the direction of the current flow, generating a torque on the mirror.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0227">The voice coil actuators of the presently disclosed embodiments may offer several potential advantages.

The wire may be wound between 80 and 200 turns, preferably with an orthocyclic pattern. If the coil thickness is increased, the distance between the magnet and the coil decreases, increasing magnetic field and turn force, but decreasing the air gap space available for rotations.

Because the horizontal motor rotates the entire inner assembly, the horizontal motor may be configured to produce a larger torque as compared to the vertical motor. Thus, the size of the coil and respective magnets associated with the horizontal may also be larger than corresponding components of the vertical mirror. The horizontal motor parts may be situated above, below, or behind the mirror. Locating the motor above or below the mirror may provide certain advantages, such as helping to maintain a compact magnet configuration.

In some cases, if rotation of the mirror results in an overlap between the reflecting surface of the mirror and motor parts, such as the yokes of the horizontal scanning mirror, there can be unwanted blockages of light reflected from the mirror surface. To address such an issue, the mirror may be rotated relative to an appropriate motor rotation axis.

For example, the mass and inertia of the system, coupled with desired scanning rates for LIDAR systems, can present challenges associated with heat dissipation due to the relatively high power/current levels needed to scan the mirror. To address these challenges, it may be desirable to take advantage of system resonance modes in scanning in one or more of the vertical or horizontal directions. Resonant scanning can reduce the current levels needed to oscillate the mirror at the rates/frequencies of interest.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0255">One potential issue associated with resonant scanning, however, is the non-linear motion experienced by the mirror over the scan range. For example, as the mirror is scanned at resonance in the horizontal (or vertical) direction, its scan speed may vary sinusoidally such that the mirror slows toward the extremes of the scanning range, but speeds to a maximum scan speed at the midpoint of a scan line. In many LIDAR systems, the center of the scan lines generally coincide with areas of high interest (e.g., directly ahead of a vehicle near the horizon, etc.), while areas at the extreme edges of a scan (e.g., coinciding with areas to the left or right of the vehicle) may be of less interest. The higher scan speeds of the mirror near the center of the scan lines, when driven in a resonant mode, can increase the difficulty of achieving desired scan resolutions in the center of the scans. For example, the maximum available laser pulse frequency, in combination with the mirror scanning speed near the center of a scan line at resonance, may result in a sampling frequency less than a desired resolution level for a particular region of interest.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0256">Scanning Dynamics</p><p id="p-0260" num="0257">The amplitude and frequency of the oscillating mirror depends on several factors, including the current induced in the coil, the moment of inertia of the oscillating mirror system, the resonant frequency of the oscillating mirror system, the drag on the rotation of the oscillating mirror system, such as due to friction, etc. The motion can be further tuned to achieve desired parameters by adding resonance features, such as springs to achieve a desired oscillatory resonance response of the mirror. The motion of each axis may be tuned independently, and each rotation axis oscillation may be driven to rotate with a different amplitude and frequency.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">One goal in relying upon resonance dynamics is achieving a desired system resolution at acceptable driving power and temperature levels. As noted above, one method for reducing driving power in oscillating systems is to create a resonance condition on the oscillatory motion by adding a spring to the system. The resonance frequency may be tuned by adjusting the spring properties, and the system may be driven with an AC signal having a resonance-inducing frequency.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0259">In the disclosed embodiments, either or both of scan directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical) can be accomplished using resonant scanners. Further, as discussed in more detail below, resonant scanners according to example embodiments may be configured to oscillate at resonant frequencies, but with non-sinusoidal waveforms, which can significantly increase the potential for higher sampling resolutions in certain regions of interest (e.g., near the center of a FOV).</p><p id="p-0263" num="0260">Generating Non-Sinusoidal Scan Patterns Based on Resonant System Frequencies</p><p id="p-0264" num="0261">Although resonant oscillators can reduce driving power requirements for a scanning system, among other benefits, they may have other challenges, as discussed above. Particularly, due to the sinusoidal pattern of a mirror movement with a single torsional natural frequency, the light projection over the scan lines is non-uniform. The resonant oscillation is faster at the center of the rotation, and slower at the edges, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0262">This sinusoidal motion pattern may be undesirable in LIDAR applications, where the resolution desired at the center of a scan may be highest while the resolution at the edges of the scan may be lower (i.e. the opposite of the conditions created by the resonant oscillation). For many applications, a more uniform resolution potential may be desirable. In contrast to a sinusoidal scan pattern, triangle waveforms may provide more uniform scanning speeds over the scan lines and, therefore, may provide the desired uniform resolution capabilities and uniform illumination across the LIDAR FOV. Triangle waveforms may enable higher sampling resolutions in regions near the center of a FOV, as compared to sinusoidal waveforms. Example scanning waveforms are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0263">In some cases, the scanning frequency may be tuned dynamically and during operation of the scanner. For example, one or more of the masses may be tuned during operation in order to change, e.g., a moment of inertia associated with a particular mass. Such tuning can change the resonant frequency of the scanner to change the scan rate, frame capture rate, etc. Any suitable technique for moving a mass may be employed. In some cases, a motor may be used, e.g., to adjust a position of a weight with respect to a shaft, adjust a nut relative to a threaded rod, etc.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0264">Relative to the described bi-axial scanner embodiments, including a voice coil actuator for rotating a mirror about a vertical scan axis and another voice coil actuator for rotating the mirror about a horizontal scan axis, either or both of the vertical and horizontal scanning systems may be configured to scan at respective resonant frequencies. And, as described, using a combination of masses and springs, the resonant oscillation waveforms of the horizontal and/or vertical scanning systems may constitute triangle waveforms rather than sinusoidal waveforms (although sinusoidal resonant oscillation waveforms may also be used in certain applications).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0265">In some embodiments, the horizontal scanner may be configured to oscillate at resonance, while the vertical scanner may be driven quasi-statically (not at resonance). In certain embodiments, such as the example shown in the figure below where the horizontal scanning system is more massive than the vertical scanning system and is charged with rotating the entire assembly over a wider range than the vertical scanning system, driving the horizontal scanner at resonance while driving the vertical scanning system quasi-statically may be counterintuitive. For example, because the outer motor (horizontal motor) rotates the entire inner assembly, a larger torque is required as the inertia of the system is higher due to the added mass of the inner motor parts and frame. The size of the coil and respective magnets of the horizontal scanner may, therefore, be larger than those of the vertical scanner. The outer motor can be driven to achieve a resonance response within a desired frequency range. Because of the mass rotated by the horizontal motor, operating the horizontal scanner in a non-resonant mode may exceed allowable power limits for the system. The inner motor, however, maybe driven to achieve a quasi-static response. As a result, the inner motor may require higher driving power than the outer motor.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0266">Quasi-static drive of the vertical scanning system may provide several advantages, including greater control over the scanning angle, variable rotation speed, variable resolution capability, and additional degrees of freedom in scanning.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0267">In some cases, the horizontal and vertical scanning systems may be configured to provide FOV scan areas of a desired shape. For example, the scan amplitude of the horizontal scanning system may cover a wider angular range than the vertical scanning system to produce a rectangular FOV that has a horizontal dimension larger than a vertical dimension. In some cases, the amplitude of the outer (horizontal in this case) rotation may be +/&#x2212;35 to 40 degrees, while the amplitude of the inner (vertical) rotation may be +/&#x2212;10 to 20 degrees, such that the vertical scan is narrower than the horizontal scan.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0268">In another example, the frequency of a first rotation (e.g., horizontal scanner) may be an induced at a resonant frequency, while the frequency of a second rotation may be non-resonant. In some cases, correction for keystone distortions may be done using the vertical axis scan.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0269">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, a spring resonator <b>5</b> may be a hairspring resonator, enabling resonant scanning in the horizontal direction about axis A<b>1</b> (the horizontal scan axis). The hairspring resonator may be implemented as a double helix and may act as multiple springs (with several modes).</p><p id="p-0273" num="0270">For resonant or semi-resonant rotations/oscillations, a spring may be part of the assembly. The spring may be a steel wire located within the shaft about which the horizontal rotations occur. The spring may be a wire, which is under torsion when the mirror is rotated, without requiring any bearings.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0271">Flexures</p><p id="p-0275" num="0272">Flexures may be used in the system to enable the mirror to pivot about the flexure axis in response to the applied torque from the coil, while the support elements (suspension frame+yokes) remain relatively static. The flexures may offer advantages over bearings, such as cost effective manufacturing, no grease in the system, long lifetime, reliability over wide ranges of stress and temperatures, etc.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0273">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref>, an X-flexure is constructed of two crossed leaf springs, perpendicular to each other, to produce a rotational suspension.

Flexures in this case may be a less expensive and superior component to bearings.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0274">Heat Dissipation from a Bi-Axial Mechanical Scanner</p><p id="p-0278" num="0275">The disclosed scanning systems may take advantage of resonant oscillation modes (e.g., relative to the horizontal scanning system) to reduce overall power required for moving the scanning mirror at a desired rate/frequency. Nevertheless, even when driven at resonance, the horizontal scanning system may require power levels that generate enough heat to damage components. And, driving the vertical scanning motor quasi-statically (not at resonance) may require even higher power levels, which may generate even more heat.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0276">The disclosed embodiments may include one or more structural features configured to manage heat produced by the scanning systems. For example, support structures may be fabricated from thermally conductive materials to facilitate heat dissipation from the coil. When current flows through the coil (especially the coil associated with the vertical scanner, which is driven at a quasi-static scanning speed (non-resonant)), significant amounts of heat may be generated. Depending on the material used for the coil, there will be a maximum operating temperature for the coil (e.g., 200 degrees C. in some cases) above which damage to the coil may occur. When the support structures are composed of thermally conductive materials, the heat may dissipate from the coil to the coil support, which may be connected to the backbone and the mirror to acts as a heat sink.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0277">In some cases, maintaining the driving power for the scanning system(s) below about 3 Watts, or 1 Watt, may ensure that the temperature of the coil(s) remain below their respective operating temperature threshold levels.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0278">Because the inertial properties of the scanner and power requirements to drive the scanner are important, the scanner may be constructed with a lightweight low density (e.g., a polymer, ceramic) frame. Such a configuration may be well-suited for injection molding and may effectively resist corrosion. These materials, however, generally do not conduct heat well.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0279">In some embodiments, certain components may be made thermally conductive (at least to a sufficient degree) to effectively dissipate heat generated in the coils. The coil supports, linkages, coil holders, mirror, or any other structures in the system may be constructed of thermally conductive material (e.g., magnesium, aluminum, etc.) to facilitate heat transfer away from the coils.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0280">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref>, a coil may be coupled to a coil holder, which secures the coil to the mirror.

In this instance, the inner coil (of the vertical scanning motor) has the highest temperature. In order to enable heat dissipation, the coil may be adhered to the coil holder with a thermally conductive adhesive, and the coil holder itself may be formed of a thermally conductive material (e.g., stainless steel, etc.). Heat may then be conducted to the coil holder and on to the mirror.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0282">Additionally, because the coil is oriented vertically, the natural convection causes air flow in the space between the magnets/yokes where the coil is situated. Heated air rises, and air flows in an upwards direction.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0283">As noted above, the presently disclosed scanning system may include flexures to enable the mirror to pivot about axis A<b>2</b>, for example. The flexures may be made from stainless steel, and, therefore, may serve as reasonable heat conductors. If the flexures were replaced by more common components, such as bearings and a shaft, the thermal conductance and heat dissipation efficiency may be significantly reduced. The flexures may effectively dissipate heat from the coil/mirror.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0284">In addition to thermal conductivity, it may be advantageous for these components to have high emissivity in order to facilitate dissipation of heat in the system.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0285">In addition to material selection, one or more structures may be included to facilitate thermal management. For example, fans or liquid cooling systems may be included to transfer heat away from the motor coils. Fins or other high surface area structures may also be included to help transfer and dissipate heat.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Part II: Magnetic Resonator</heading><p id="p-0289" num="0286">Two problems that are frequently contemplated when designing mechanical oscillatory systems include: 1) minimizing the power consumption of the oscillatory system, and 2) maintaining a uniform velocity of the oscillator throughout the range of motion of the oscillator. To reduce (e.g., minimize) power consumption in an oscillatory system, the oscillatory system should be driven at a resonant frequency, such as the fundamental resonant frequency (i.e., the lowest energy resonant frequency) of the system. Driving the oscillatory system at the resonant frequency reduces actuator and/or control requirements and, thus, reduces the power required to drive the system. Resonant frequencies of a system may change, for example, by modifying system geometry, system materials, mass of the oscillator, or by adding or removing components such as springs and/or dampeners, among other things. When resonant frequencies of an oscillatory system change, the system should adjust for this change and continue to drive the oscillator at the resonant frequency to reduce power requirements.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0287">As the oscillator approaches the ends of its range-of-motion and changes oscillation direction, velocity of the oscillator may not be uniform (e.g., may be slower or faster) through this change-of-direction when compared to the velocity of the oscillator in the other parts (e.g., the middle) of the range-of-motion. Springs have been used to facilitate the directional change of a mechanical oscillatory system; however, a spring exerts a linear reaction force, which may not be suitable to reverse motion of an oscillator while maintaining a substantially uniform velocity. Moreover, the position of the spring may be limited to the axis of rotation (in a rotational oscillatory system), which may increase the size of the system (e.g., when the rotation is horizontal, the height of the system increases to accommodate the spring).</p><p id="p-0291" num="0288">In certain applications, maintaining a uniform velocity throughout the entire range of motion of the oscillator provides better results. For example, Laser Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is one specific example of an application where these problems arise. In LIDAR, one or more mirrors oscillate at high frequencies back and forth across a field of view (FOV). While smaller mirrors may be easier to drive and control for angular velocity, larger mirrors take more energy to drive and control due to increased momentum. Moreover, LIDAR systems collect data points (i.e., reflection of light) during the oscillation of the mirrors and a uniform velocity of the oscillating mirror is required to provide equal measurement time to all pixels (e.g., time of flight, number of repetitions), thereby resulting in a substantially uniform resolution across the FOV.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0289">It has been discovered that these problems may be solved through the use of magnetic bumpers that provide a non-linear force on an oscillator (e.g., a rotor) having one or more magnets attached thereto as the oscillator magnet(s) approach the magnetic bumper at each end of the range-of-motion. As the oscillator approaches the ends of its range of motion, the magnet(s) attached to the oscillator&#x2014;and therefore the oscillator itself&#x2014;will experience a non-linearly (e.g., exponentially) increasing magnetic force as the oscillator approaches closer to the ends of its range of motion. Additionally, the magnetic bumpers prevent any potential impact of the oscillator with another part of the system due to the increasing magnetic repulsion at the ends of its range of motion, reducing the likelihood of damage.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0290">Disclosed herein are systems and assemblies for controlling motion of a single-degree-of-freedom mechanical oscillator using one or more magnetic bumpers where the oscillator is configured to oscillate at a resonant frequency of the system.

In various embodiments, the controller receives, as input, voltage data supplied to a motor. In various embodiments, the controller receives, as input, voltage data supplied to one or more electromagnets (e.g., rotor magnets, stator magnets, and/or booster electromagnets). In various embodiments, the controller adjusts the speed of a motor and/or the voltages supplied to electromagnets (e.g., rotor electromagnets, stator electromagnets, and/or booster electromagnets) based on the resonant frequency of the system, for example, if the resonant frequency of the system changes as the rotor oscillates. In various embodiments, the controller is configured to maintain the rotor oscillating at the inherent resonant frequency of the oscillatory system.

In various embodiments, the duty cycle is adjusted by allowing the booster electromagnets to assume the free-running configuration. In various embodiments, the duty cycle is adjusted by allowing the booster electromagnets to assume the brake operation configuration.

Distortions can be a result of rotation of an array of laser beams generated by a laser array due to the variable angle of incidence of each beam on the light deflector. Distortions can also be a result of the tilt of the projecting plane (mirror surface) with respect to the image plane. Such distortions result in an undesirable point cloud with a non-uniform resolution, shaped irregularly as opposed to a desired shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b></figref>, is an illustration of an undesirable distortion of the scan lines (i.e. the projections of the scanning light beam onto an image plane). In this example, a desirable rectangular projection is distorted into a curved surface.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0374">In order to correct for this effect, one or both of the following approaches can be used.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Axis Tilt</heading><p id="p-0380" num="0375">In one embodiment, any of the biaxial scanning assemblies described hereinabove can be further modified by tilting one of the axes of rotation.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0376">Any biaxial scanning system described herein may scan a field of view (FOV) defined as a solid angle formed by beams deflected from a mirror at the extreme angles of the mirror's rotation around both first (e.g., horizontal, controlling the elevation angle) and second (e.g., vertical, controlling the azimuthal angle) axes. Planes are defined by any two beams deflected at opposite extreme angles of the mirror's rotation about a given axis (i.e., at opposite extreme angles of the FOV), while the other angle of rotation of the mirror is fixed. A &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; bisecting plane exists that bisects the full range of angles of rotation about the first (e.g., horizontal) axis; similarly, a &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; bisecting plane exists that bisects the full range of angles of rotation about the second (e.g., vertical) axis.

For example, rather than completing the horizontal line scans each at a fixed vertical angle of the scanning mirror, the scanning mirror may be rotated non-monotonously about its horizontal scan axis, and at the same time as it rotates about its vertical scan axis to complete each horizontal line scan. It should be understood that the choice of the axis is arbitrary: the same pre-distortion scheme can be applied to a mirror that completes a vertical line scan by oscillating (rotating) about the horizontal scan axis (controlling the elevation angle), while the mirror's angle of rotation about the horizontal scan axis (controlling the azimuthal angle) is changed non-monotonously.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0381"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref> shows a scan pattern of the scanner that has not been pre-distorted. The mechanical scan pattern is the angle of the normal to the surface of the reflector as it scans the FOV, where (0,0) is the center of the field of view. Each horizontal scan line is completed at a fixed position of the scanning mirror relative to its vertical scan axis. For clarity, it should be noted that the values on the axes are normalized to the maximum amplitude of the scan, such that the maximum amplitude is 1. For example, by sequentially rotating a scanning mirror <b>6</b> about an axis (e.g. V<sub>1</sub>), laser light beams may be directed along a plurality of points in a left-right direction as represented by horizontal scan lines. Further by sequentially rotating scanning mirror <b>6</b> about a second axis (e.g. V<sub>2</sub>) in a top-bottom direction, laser light beams may be directed along a plurality of points in an up-down direction. The combined 2D movements of the scanning mirror <b>6</b> may generate the scanning pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, and the vertical progression of the scan in this example is top-bottom.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0382">In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref> shows the scanning angles of a scan pattern that has been pre-distorted to compensate for the distortions. In this scan pattern, the scanning mirror rotates along both its vertical scan axis and its horizontal scan axis simultaneously. In this example, it can be seen that there is an upshift at the edges of each scan line. The pattern shown is useful when the angle of incidence of the light beam onto the deflector (e.g., a mirror) is smallest at the center of the angular range of rotation about one of the scan axes and largest at the extremes of the angular range. In this example, the vertical motion causes the scanner to create scan lines that are separated by an angular displacement (which can be variable for variable resolution). However, in a pre-distorted scan, the vertical displacement may be in the direction opposite to the progression of the scan along a single horizontal line, for example.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0383">It is understood that the choice of a labels &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; or &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; with respect to axes is arbitrary and a similar pre-distortion scheme can be applied to either one of the axes of a biaxial scanner.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0384">Another example of a pre-distorted scan pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>.

As a result, the distortion is smallest at one extreme and largest at the other extreme, requiring the compensating scan pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0385">Another example of a pre-distorted scan pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>C</figref>, which shows an example of a vertical scan pattern.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0386">As stated above, the tilted axis design illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b>B</figref> be combined with the pre-distorted scan pattern approach to resolve distortion in the scan.

Each scan pattern comprises scan lines.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0388">It can be seen that by varying the axis tilt, it is possible to reduce the required compensatory pre-distortion. This is beneficial, because implementing the pre-distorted scan pattern may result in high energy consumption (e.g. high peak power, high average power, or increased actuator size requirements). While resonant scanning is very energy efficient, driving the quasi-static actuator to implement a scanning pattern with pre-distortion can be energy consuming. Reducing the required compensatory pre-distortion by tilting the axis may bring the power requirements to a feasible range. Thus, reducing the pre-distortion is valuable in many LIDAR applications. This benefit is especially valuable in resonant scanning designs such as those described hereinabove. In certain example embodiments, the power requirement for the driving the biaxial scanner can be less than or equal to 4 W.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0389">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>C</figref> shows scan lines in the center of the FOV (i.e. (0,0) and near it) are nearly flat, i.e. require a smaller predistortion than that required for scan lines near the edges of the FOV, which are more curved. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>67</b>B</figref>, shows flat scan lines at the bottom of the FOV (i.e. phi between &#x2212;7 and &#x2212;10), and more curved as the scan angle increases. The tilt angle may be selected to minimize the required power to implement the scan (i.e. minimize the required pre-distortion), for a particular system. Alternatively, the tilt pattern may be selected to minimize the required pre-distortion in a particular region of the FOV (e.g. a region of interest (ROI), such as the central portion of the FOV).</p><p id="p-0395" num="0390">In various embodiments, the axis tilt can be selected to be any value from &#x2212;1 to &#x2212;40 degrees. For example, the tilt can be &#x2212;<b>12</b>.<b>5</b>, &#x2212;<b>15</b>, -<b>25</b>, or &#x2212;37.5 degrees.</p><p id="p-0396" num="0391">In order to generate pre-distorted raster scans, in certain embodiments the scanning actuation is quasi-static (i.e. can be moved by an arbitrary angle) such that the position of the scanner can be controlled precisely. In certain implementations, quasi-static scanning requires high driving power. This is in contrast with resonant scanning, described hereinabove, which has low power requirements. However, scanner position along the resonant axis cannot be set arbitrarily.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0392">The mirror can rotate at different angular velocities relative to its horizontal and vertical scan axes. For example, the scanning mirror may rotate more slowly about its vertical scan axis than about its horizontal scan axis. The resulting mirror rotations produce, for example, a horizontal scan pattern such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>67</b>-<b>69</b></figref>. It should be noted that the converse may be true in certain embodiments. For example, a scanning mirror may rotate more slowly about its horizontal scan axis relative to rotations about its vertical scan axis. Such operation can be used to produce a vertical scan pattern, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>C</figref>. The distance between the rows in, e.g., the horizontal scan can be referred to as the vertical offset, or a pitch, or vertical angular displacement, between scan line. In one example, the distance between scan lines, or angular displacement (e.g. vertical shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>A</figref>, horizontal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b>C</figref> may vary to provide regions of higher potential point cloud resolution (e.g., in a region including the horizon or in any other region of interest).</p><p id="p-0398" num="0393">Each scan line may be scanned with a plurality of laser beams (e.g., generated using a laser array as described above and below). With this type of multi-beam scanning, as the mirror follows the lines of the scan pattern in the figure above, the areas between the lines in the scan pattern are filled in (or scanned) with individual scan lines each associated with one of the multiple laser beams being simultaneously projected toward the FOV by the scanning mirror, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>. In some examples, the distance between each line (angular displacement) in the scan pattern may be equal to or larger than the total angular coverage provided by the multiple beam spots of the laser source array. In other cases, the distance between at least some lines in the scan pattern may be less than the total angular coverage provided by the multiple beam spots of the laser source array.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0394">It will be appreciated that the horizontal scan lines need not be evenly spaced. For example, to scan certain regions of the LIDAR FOV, such as the areas above and below the horizon region, an increment of the vertical tilt (elevation angle) of the mirror can be selected that is greater than a minimum available tilt increment. For example, the regions above and below the center of the scan can be scanned with a vertical tilt increment different to that of the center of the scan. The center of the scan may, for example, be directed at the horizon. For example, the regions above and below the center of the scan can be scanned using a vertical angular increment (about the horizontal scan axis) of 0.6&#xb0; which may correspond, for example, to the entire angular size of the light source (e.g., a laser array), thus generating coarse sampling resolution equal to the laser pitch in the array. The laser pitch refers to the center-to-center distance between active laser light emitting regions of the laser array. In the region including the center of the scan, however, a minimum vertical tilt angle can be used to provide more closely spaced scan lines in that region and, in turn, higher sampling/point cloud resolution in that region. Assuming that a ratio of laser active area to non-active ratio is 1:N-1, the line spacing may be up N times more packed. In this example, the point cloud vertical resolution may depend on the line spacing while the horizontal resolution may depend on the frequency at which the single laser source is pulsed as the 2-D scanning mirror scans along each horizontal scan line. The higher the pulse frequency, the higher the potential horizontal resolution of the generated point cloud from the LIDAR system.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0395">In some embodiments, rotation of the biaxial scanning mirror about one of the two axes may cause displacement of the plurality of laser beams from a first set of locations associated with a first plurality of scan lines to a second set of locations associated with a second plurality of scan lines. It is contemplated that in some embodiments of LIDAR system described herein, rather than relying on a single laser light source, multiple laser light sources can be used. It is also contemplated that light beams from one or more laser sources may be split to provide multiple laser beams available for scanning. As also discussed above, a laser array (e.g., a 1-D laser array as described in the examples in the sections above) may be used to provide multiple laser beams for scanning a LIDAR FOV. When a plurality of laser light beams from laser array are directed to the mirror, rotation of the mirror about the vertical scan axis (the azimuthal angle of rotation) may produce a plurality of horizontal scan lines traversing a first set of locations. Further, rotation of the mirror about the horizontal axis (the elevation angle of rotation) may shift the plurality of horizontal scan lines vertically, thereby generating a second set of scan lines traversing a second set of locations vertically spaced apart from the first set of locations. In some embodiments, a rate of rotation about the scan axis may be faster than a rate of rotation about the horizontal (elevation angle) axis.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0396">In view of the above, in one example embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>, the present invention is a scanning system <b>100</b>, comprising a light source <b>2</b> configured to generate at least one light beam <b>4</b>; at least one deflector <b>6</b>; a first actuator <b>8</b> configured to rotate the at least one deflector <b>6</b> about a first scan axis <b>14</b> and a second actuator <b>10</b> configured to rotate the at least one deflector about a second scan axis <b>12</b>, the at least one deflector configured to deflect the at least one light beam to a field of view; and at least one processor <b>16</b> configured to control the light source <b>2</b>, the first actuator <b>8</b> and the second actuator <b>10</b> to cause the at least one deflector <b>6</b> to scan the field of view, wherein during scanning of at least a portion of the field of view, the at least one processor <b>16</b> causes the first actuator <b>8</b> and the second actuator <b>10</b> to simultaneously rotate the at least one deflector <b>6</b> about the first scanning axis <b>12</b> and the second scanning axis <b>14</b> according to a compensated scan pattern, wherein the compensated scan pattern at least partially compensates for one or more distortions associated with a varying incidence angle of the at least one light beam onto the at least one deflector <b>8</b>.

If the angle of rotation of the deflector by the first actuator about the first axis is fixed at a predetermined value, and the second actuator causes the deflector to oscillate (i.e. rotate) about the second axis, the deflected light beam would generate a line in the scan pattern. In certain embodiments, both the first and the second actuators are simultaneously rotating the deflector. An &#x201c;angular span&#x201d; about a first axis is a maximum absolute value of the deviation from a predetermined fixed value of the angle of rotation of the deflector by the first actuator about the first axis during the oscillation (i.e. rotation) of the deflector about the second axis. For example, an angular span of zero about the first axis would generate a line in the scan pattern. A non-zero angular span about the first axis would generate a line that is curved with respect to (or, generally, deviates from) the zero angular span line.

In various embodiments, the compensatory pitch can be chosen to compensate for the optical distortions of the incident beam due to the variation of the incidence angle.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0404">For example, where the scan pattern is a raster, the first axis is slow, and the second axis is fast, a scan line in the scan patter is generated when an actuator causes the deflector to oscillate about the second axis while the angle of rotation with respect to the first axis is fixed (or adjusted by an angular span, defined above). Two adjacent lines are separated by a total pitch. If the incident beam comprises a plurality of beams generated by a linear array of light sources (e.g., laser diodes), the reflected beam will generate an array of scan lines corresponding to one oscillation about the second axis. The arrays of scan lines will be distorted due to a difference in incidence angle of each beam of the plurality of beams, rotating of the array of laser beams resulting in gaps in scanned areas proportional to the incidence angle. For example, beams are rotated to be non-perpendicular with the scan axis (azimuth), as described in the first paragraph in this section. This effect is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>, which depicts a scan patter generated by a linear array of lasers.

Thus, LIDAR systems may include a large number of components to obtain and collect data over a wide field of view (FOV), while providing high reliability of the system. Existing systems typically include a laser emitter, scanning mirrors, and a detector (referred to as a Laser Range Finder [LRF]) for each beam emitted from the laser. However, existing systems may have high complexity, a large number of components (e.g., require multiple LRF's), and may be expensive.

In some embodiments, a common optical components <b>8380</b> may be used both to transmit laser light <b>8342</b> emitted from laser array <b>8340</b> to 2-D scanner <b>8360</b> and toward FOV <b>8370</b> and to direct reflected light <b>8342</b> received at 2-D scanner <b>8360</b> from FOV <b>8370</b> to sensor array <b>8350</b>. Such an arrangement may provide significant advantages in terms of reduced complexity, lower cost, reliability, and performance. This arrangement may allow wide FOV scanning if the 2D scanner <b>8360</b> has a wide angular rotation span.

For example, in some embodiments, a 1-D laser array may be configured to operate with a 1:1 ratio of active laser channels to inactive interstitial space between the laser channels. This may be accomplished in several ways. For example, 16 laser channels may be arranged in a 1-D array <b>8500</b> such that each pair of adjacent laser sources may be separated by an interstitial inactive space of equal size as each laser source. As a result, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>, the 1-D array may include an alternating and repeating sequence of one laser source <b>8510</b> adjacent to one interstitial inactive space <b>8520</b> in the array. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref>, the laser source <b>8510</b> and interstitial inactive region <b>8512</b> may be similarly sized (e.g., approximately 0.01 mm&#xd7;0.1 mm, or 0.001 mm&#xd7;0.1 mm). After the laser beam is emitted, each beam may be collimated by one or more collimators. Once the beam is collimated, its size spot size in far field may be expressed as an angular size. Thus, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>87</b>A</figref>, beams emitted from laser array <b>8500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>A</figref> may have an angular width of 0.1&#xb0; after being collimated and a spacing between adjacent collimated beams may be 0.2&#xb0;.

In addition to a 1:1 array, as represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>75</b>A-<b>75</b>C</figref>, a 1:2 ratio array may also be used. For example, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>75</b>D-<b>75</b>F</figref>, each of the example arrays described above may include interstitial inactive spaces of two times the width of each laser source. Thus, in each of the 16-channel, 8-channel, and 4-channel array examples, each pair of laser sources may be separated by an inactive space with twice the width of one of the laser sources. Thus, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>D</figref>, each laser source <b>8540</b> may have a width of 0.05 mm whereas each inactive space <b>8542</b> may have a width of about 0.1 mm (e.g. 110 microns). By way of another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>E</figref>, each laser source <b>8550</b> may have a width of 0.1 mm whereas each inactive space <b>8552</b> may have a width of about 0.2 mm.

Other ratios of the laser source and inactive space are also contemplated. In some embodiments, a ratio of active regions to inactive regions in the monolithic laser array may be 1:3. In some embodiments, a ratio of active regions to inactive regions in the monolithic laser array may be 1:5. In some embodiments, a ratio of active regions to inactive regions in the monolithic laser array may be within a range of 1:1 to 1:10. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>G</figref> illustrates an example where the ratio of the active to inactive regions is 1:5. In this example, each active laser source is separated by an inactive space having a width equal to five times the width of one of the laser sources. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>G</figref>, each laser source <b>8570</b> may have a width of about 0.1 mm whereas each inactive space <b>8572</b> may have a width of about 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0429">In some embodiments, an overall length (L<b>1</b>) of the monolithic laser array may be between 0.5 mm to 20 mm.

For example, when a laser beam emitted from a laser array is incident on an object in the field of view, the beam may produce a spot of laser light on the object. A shape of the emitted beam (spot) may be symmetrical, or elongated in one axis. Elongation may enhance eye safety in some cases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b>H</figref> illustrates an exemplary magnified image of a spot generated by a laser beam emitted from, for example, laser array <b>8500</b>.

To further promote eye safety, the ratio of active to inactive spacing in the laser array (e.g., <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>) may be selected to preserve a minimum angular spacing between active laser beams. The minimum spacing may be determined by a government or safety standards organization, for example. In some cases, the minimum angular spacing between beams may be 5 mrad, or about 0.29 degrees.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0431">Any number of active and inactive regions may be present on monolithic detector <b>8600</b>.

Thus for example, N may be 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. In some embodiments, the detector may include 4 light sensitive active regions (e.g., N=4). In some embodiments, the detector may include 8 light sensitive active regions (e.g., N=8). In some embodiments, the detector may include 16 light sensitive active regions (e.g., N=16). In some embodiments, the detector may include 32 light sensitive active regions (e.g., N=32).</p><p id="p-0437" num="0432">In some embodiments, two or more of the plurality of laser beams may have a divergence different from one another. Although each of laser beams (e.g., <b>8342</b>, etc.) have been illustrated as a single line, each laser beam is expected to diverge once it emerges from laser illumination system <b>102</b>. Thus, each laser beam may be represented by a plurality of rays diverging from each other with increasing distance towards the field of view. It is also contemplated that an amount or angle of divergence of different laser beams may be equal or unequal. In some embodiments, each of the reflected beams may produce a beam spot incident upon two or more of the light sensitive active regions. The plurality of rays representing each laser beam may be reflected from the field of view. The plurality of reflected rays may form a spot on the detector (e.g., <b>8600</b>). It is contemplated that in some embodiments the spot of reflected laser light beam rays may be incident on only one active region <b>8610</b> of, for example, detector <b>8630</b> or on more than one active region of detector <b>1130</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary spot <b>8650</b> that may be incident on more than one active region <b>8610</b> (e.g., n<b>2</b>, n<b>3</b>) of detector <b>1130</b>. By ensuring that spot <b>8650</b> is incident on more than one active region <b>8610</b>, it may be possible to ensure that more than one active region generates a signal corresponding to a detected object from which laser beams were reflected. The separate signals corresponding to a region on a detected object enables increased resolution for that region, i.e. each active region is a distinct pixel of a subregion within the region on the detected object.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0433">In some embodiments, the LIDAR system may include at least one processor configured to control an orientation of one or more components of the common scanning unit to cause scanning of the field of view of the LIDAR system with the plurality of laser beams along a series of scan lines.

By controlling scanning units <b>8360</b>, processor <b>118</b> may be able to direct one or more of laser light beams toward different portions of the field of view, thereby allowing LIDAR system <b>100</b> to scan the field of view using one or more laser light beams as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0439" num="0434">In some embodiments, the field of view of the LIDAR system may have a vertical angular dimension of between 6 degrees and 90 degrees, and the field of view of the LIDAR system may have a horizontal angular dimension of between 20 degrees and 140 degrees. As discussed above scanning units <b>8360</b> may rotate about a scan axis and/or a tilt axis to project laser light over a desired field of view. Reflected laser light beams from the field of view may be detected to detect the presence of one or more objects in the field of view.
