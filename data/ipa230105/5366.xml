generally relates to portable traffic signals and, even more particularly, relates to: improved portable traffic signals, systems with more than one portable traffic signal, new methods of transporting and deploying portable traffic signals, and new systems and methods for communication between multiple remote portions of multi-traffic signal systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, deployment of multiple traffic signal head systems has often been more laborious and time consuming than is optimal, because they are often needed at short notice after some unexpected event.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While some multi-traffic signal head systems which are made with wireless communication capabilities have been small enough to be hauled on a trailer(s) have provided significant utility in a wide variety of locations and applications have been used quite extensively in the past, they are often difficult and time consuming to deploy and configure on-site and often require multiple people or a large amount of time for a skilled technician.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, there exists a need for more economical methods and systems for deploying and using multiple portable traffic signals at a remote location.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of one aspect of the present invention to provide a portable traffic signal which has a compact transportable and flexible system which is quick and easy to deploy and operate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a feature of one aspect of the present invention to utilize a pivoting signal head.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another feature to include a J shaped hook member disposed on the portable traffic signal unit which engages a portion of a trailer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another feature of the present invention to provide a trailer configured to transport four portable traffic signal units.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is still another feature of the invention to provide a sleek trailer bed which is free of any tie downs or other members which are raised above the plane of the top surface of the bed of the trailer, for receiving any ropes, straps or elongated flexible members used to stabilize a portable traffic signal unit with respect to the trailer bed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an advantage of the present invention to provide for a system where four portable traffic signals can readily be stored on a small, short clearance height, narrow and easily towed trailer and be detached all without the need for ropes, straps, cables, chains, or other elongated flexible members.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another object of the present invention to eliminate all wires extending between the signal head and a base portion of a portable traffic signal, when a battery is located at the signal head, and in the alternative, to limit the number of such wires to just two when no battery is located at the signal head.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a feature to power all aspects of the traffic signal with a common power line plus a common ground line located in the signal head.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a feature of the present invention to eliminate all wireless communication between a master base unit and a remote base unit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another feature of the present invention to eliminate all control wires extending from a remote base unit to its signal head.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an additional advantage of this embodiment of the present invention to provide a remote control for providing wireless signal to a plurality of signal heads, where the remote control contains a button which has a sole purpose to command, with a single push of the button, extending the time of the current phase of operation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is yet another feature of the present invention to provide a button which provides for direct switching, i.e. changing to another phase without the need for scrolling through an intermediate phase.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide for rapid deployment of a horizontally and vertically compact portable multiple traffic signal head system in an efficient manner.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is another feature of the present invention to include a three stage telescopic horizontal arm configured to cause a series of smaller internally nested arms to extend outwardly from a larger volume proximal arm at an angle upwardly inclined with respect to the proximal arm.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the present invention is a portable system for rapidly providing a portable traffic signal unit at a remote location comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li

At the distal end of second stage arm <b>1113</b> there is shown a thin UHMW <b>1310</b> pad disposed on an upper interior side and an opposing thick UHMW pad <b>1320</b> disposed the lower interior side. The use of differing thickness pads at the ends of the third and second stage would result in the distal end of the third stage arm being vertically higher than the proximal end if no traffic signal were placed at the distal end of the third stage arm <b>1111</b>. However, when a traffic signal is placed on its distal end, its weight tends to cause the third stage arm <b>1111</b> to deflect downward making the distal end be lower than if no traffic signal were present. If the difference in thickness between UHMW pad <b>1320</b> and <b>1310</b> is made larger if the material used for third stage arm <b>1111</b> is more prone to bending downward, the problems associated with a sagging distal traffic light can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0071">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, there is shown a cross-section view of the first and second stage arms generally designated <b>1400</b>, which is a similar situation except for use of a single roller is used in place of the thicker UHMW pads <b>1320</b> and the thin UHMW pads are eliminated.
