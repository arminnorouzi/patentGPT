The electronic components of the signal processing chain include an input amplifier <b>105</b>, an analog-to digital converter (ADC) circuit <b>110</b>, and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The input amplifier <b>105</b> can be a differential input differential output amplifier as shown, or the amplifier may have a single-ended output. In variations, the input amplifier <b>105</b> may have a single-ended input and a differential output. The ADC circuit <b>110</b> can be a successive approximation register analog-to digital converter (SAR ADC). An SAR ADC converts an analog input signal to produce an M bit (e.g., 8, 12, or 16 bit) digital output value using a successive approximation algorithm. The FPGA <b>115</b> includes logic circuitry to make decisions about operation of other parts of the system based on the acquired data. For example, the analog input signal may be generated by an electronic sensor, and the logic circuitry changes operation of an electronic system based on the detected events.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The electronic components included in the signal processing chain operate at full power (and full speed) waiting to detect an event in the signal input to the signal processing chain. In some monitoring applications (e.g., remote pipeline sensing or remote bridge sensing) the data sensitive events of interest are isolated events that occur a few times per day or a few times per month. Energy could be saved if the signal processing chain could be operated in a reduced power state until the sensor signal includes an event that causes the signal processing chain to be changed to a full power mode.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, for the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the data interface between the ADC circuit <b>110</b> and the FPGA <b>115</b> needs to be always ON to monitor the signal, even when the signal doesn't contain relevant information. Further, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a significant delay due to latency of the data interface, which can be several conversion cycles of the ADC circuit. This latency can make the response time too slow for certain applications, and the amplifier must be operated in full power at all times. Improved energy efficiency can be realized by moving the control of the signal processing chain to the ADC circuit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of another example of a signal processing chain of a data acquisition system. The signal processing chain includes an input amplifier circuit <b>205</b>, an ADC circuit <b>210</b>, and an FPGA <b>215</b> or other component that includes logic circuitry to perform the functions described regarding the FPGA <b>215</b> (e.g., a complex programmable logic device (CPLD), a microcontroller, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other data processing unit). The ADC circuit <b>210</b> may be an SAR ADC, pipeline ADC, flash ADC, dual slope ADC, or other ADC. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> operates as the master controller of the signal processing chain and as the event detector. The ADC circuit <b>210</b> includes a feature detection circuit <b>225</b> that detects a specified signal feature of the input signal and the ADC circuit <b>210</b> changes an operating condition of at least one of the other circuits of the signal processing chain in response to detecting the specific signal feature.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, the specific signal feature detected by the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may be that the amplitude of the input signal exceeds a specified threshold amplitude. The ADC circuit <b>210</b> may include a logic circuit to detect when the digital result exceeds a specified threshold corresponding to the input signal exceeding the specified threshold amplitude. In other examples, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may detect that the energy within a specific bandwidth of the input signal exceeds a specified threshold energy, that the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the input signal exceeds a specified RMS value, or that the rate of change of the input signal (e.g., dV/dt) exceeds a specified threshold rate of change. These functions can be integrated in low geometry designs with the ADC circuit. Additionally, by allowing the ADC circuit <b>210</b> to control the signal chain operating regime it can reduce the overall latency by more than two to three ADC cycles, which can be critical for capturing high-frequency events in the input signals.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When initially monitoring the input signal, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may toggle the FPGA <b>215</b> to a powered down or low power state. When the specific signal feature is detected in the input signal, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> toggles the FPGA <b>215</b> to a full power state. In some aspects, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may toggle the data interface <b>220</b> between the ADC circuit <b>210</b> and the FPGA <b>215</b> to the low power state when monitoring the input signal and toggle operation of the data interface <b>220</b> to the high power state in response to detecting the signal feature of the input signal.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an illustration of an example of waveforms associated with operation of the signal processing chain of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Waveform <b>330</b> represents the input signal to the signal processing chain. The waveform <b>330</b> may represent voltage versus time for a signal provided from an electronic sensor. In the example, the data interface and the input amplifier are in the low power state. In response to a feature of the input signal, the ADC circuit toggles the data interface and the input amplifier to the full power state to process the input signal. When the feature is no longer present in the input signal, the ADC circuit returns the signal processing chain to the low power state.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Waveform <b>320</b> represents the state of the data interface <b>220</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the feature detection circuit <b>225</b> detects when the magnitude of the input signal is greater than a specified threshold voltage represented by voltage level <b>325</b>. When the input signal waveform <b>330</b> is less than the specified threshold voltage, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> holds the data interface <b>220</b> in an off state. When the input signal waveform <b>330</b> exceeds the specified threshold voltage at <b>335</b>, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> turns the data interface <b>220</b> on. The ADC circuit <b>210</b> keeps the data interface on until the peak-to-peak amplitude of the input signal becomes lower than the specified threshold voltage, at which point the data interface is turned off. In certain aspects, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may delay turning off the data interface for a specified number of analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion cycles, or may use hysteresis in turning on and off the data interface <b>220</b> (e.g., the specified turn-on threshold may be higher than the specified turn-off threshold).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the date interface <b>220</b> may be a low voltage differential signal (LVDS) interface. An LVDS interface can consume between ten milliwatts (10 mW) and 30 mW for transmitting and receiving between the ADC circuit <b>210</b> and the FPGA <b>215</b>. The FPGA <b>215</b> can also add significant power to the signal processing. Thus, the power of the signal chain can be reduced two to three times by dynamically changing the signal chain operating mode based on the signal characteristics detected by the ADC circuit <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ADC circuit can include a clock generator circuit <b>222</b> that provides an operating clock signal with a selectable frequency to one or both of the data interface and the logic circuitry. In the alternative, or in addition to, toggling the power mode of the FPGA <b>215</b> and the data interface <b>220</b>, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> changes the frequency of the operating clock signal of one or both of the data interface <b>220</b> and the logic circuitry of the FPGA <b>215</b> when the signal feature is detected. The ADC circuit <b>210</b> may also change the A/D conversion rate. A slower clock frequency and lower conversion rate can reduce the operating power of the data interface <b>220</b>, ADC <b>210</b>, and FPGA <b>215</b>, and may be part of operating the data interface <b>220</b> and FPGA <b>215</b> in a low power mode. Increasing the clock frequency can increase the time resolution for the A/D conversion for that period of time that the input signal exhibits the specified signal feature. In the absence of the specified signal feature, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> reverts to a lower conversion rate in order to save power.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some aspects, the input amplifier circuit <b>205</b> of the signal processing chain is configured to operate in multiple power modes including a low power mode to conserve power and a high power mode. In the high power mode, the input amplifier is in a higher performance mode and the output of the input amplifier may have lower signal noise than when the input amplifier is in the lower power mode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, waveform <b>305</b> represents the state of the input amplifier circuit <b>205</b>. When the magnitude of the input signal waveform <b>330</b> is less than the specified threshold voltage <b>325</b>, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> holds the input amplifier in the low power mode. When the magnitude of the input signal waveform <b>330</b> exceeds the specified threshold voltage at <b>335</b>, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> changes the input amplifier to the high power mode or full power mode as shown in waveform <b>305</b>. The ADC circuit <b>210</b> keeps the input amplifier in the high power mode until the peak-to-peak amplitude of the input signal becomes lower than the specified threshold voltage, at which point the changes in the input amplifier back to the low power mode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some aspects, the feature detection can be used for fast overvoltage protection of the ADC inputs. If the specified feature is a specified signal amplitude threshold and the threshold is set in the vicinity of the full scale (or zero scale) value, the ADC will automatically shut down the input amplifier, protecting the amplifier input circuits.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to some aspects, the signal processing chain provides filtering to the input signal. The filtering can be a programmable characteristic of the input amplifier circuit <b>205</b> (e.g., by placing a programmable array of capacitors in parallel with feedback resistors of the amplifier). In certain aspects, the filtering can be provided by a separate filtering circuit <b>224</b> that has programmable filtering. A filtering circuit <b>224</b> separate from the input amplifier circuit <b>205</b> can be positioned between the input amplifier and the ADC circuit <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> or can be positioned before the input amplifier. The characteristics of the filtering can be selectable by the ADC circuit <b>210</b> and changed by the ADC circuit <b>210</b> in response to detecting the specified signal feature. For example, the ADC circuit <b>210</b> may change the bandwidth of the filtering to reduce noise on the input signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of another example of a signal processing chain for a data acquisition system. The signal processing chain has changeable gain at the front end of the signal processing chain. The signal processing chain includes two input amplifiers <b>405</b>, <b>407</b> and a multiplexer circuit <b>440</b> to select between the two amplifiers. The two amplifiers have their inputs connected to the same input signal, but the input amplifiers are configured with different gain values. Thus, in order to maximize the dynamic range, the channel selection by the ADC circuit <b>410</b> based on the detected signal feature will toggle to the channel with the optimum gain configuration, without saturating the input of the selected amplifier.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the two input amplifiers <b>405</b>, <b>407</b> are connected to two separate input channels. The input channels may be connected to separate sensors and the input channels receive separate input signals. In normal operation the ADC circuit <b>410</b> keeps toggling between the two input channels by controlling the multiplexer circuit <b>440</b>. When the specified signal feature is detected on a specific channel, the multiplexer selection code is selected and frozen, and the ADC converts at full throughput the input signal of that input channel. Thus, the full throughput may be committed to the input signal that has activity or exhibits a change. In variations, there are more than two input channels with an input amplifier coupled to each of the input channels.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of another example of a signal processing chain of a data acquisition system. The signal processing chain includes multiple ADC circuits, e.g., N ADC circuits, where N is an integer greater than one. The N ADC circuits are connected in parallel to each convert the input signal to a digital value. One ADC circuit <b>510</b> may operate as the master controller of the signal processing chain and as the event detector. In the absence of the specified signal feature, the master ADC circuit <b>510</b> may disable the other ADC circuits (<b>511</b>, <b>512</b>), the FPGA <b>515</b>, and the data interface <b>520</b>. The master ADC circuit <b>510</b> may enable a low power mode in the input amplifier <b>505</b>. In response to detecting the signal feature of the input signal, the master ADC circuit <b>510</b> activates or otherwise synchronizes operation of the other ADC circuits in parallel to produce N samples of the input signal in parallel. The N samples can be used to produce a low noise and/or averaged value of the input signal within a specific time window determined by the master ADC circuit <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some aspects, the multiple ADC circuits receive different input signals for conversion, and the conversion of the other input signals is synchronized by the master ADC circuit <b>510</b> in response to the ADC circuit <b>510</b> detecting the specified signal feature. The input signals may be provided by an array of sensors. In certain aspects, the sensors may be used to monitor the same object (e.g., a bridge) at different points of the object.
