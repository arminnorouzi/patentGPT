Here, eNB denotes LTE eNodeB, gNB and ng-eNB (or evolved eNB) denote NR BSs (one NR BS may correspond to one or more transmission/ reception points), and the lines between the nodes illustrate the corresponding interfaces which are under discussion in 3GPP. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates deployment scenarios with NR BS which are discussed in 3GPP.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One important architectural consideration is the dual connectivity (DC) operation involving E-UTRA and NR. In one example of Dual Connectivity (DC) operation involving E-UTRA and NR, the E-UTRA is the master. In another example of the DC operation involving E-UTRA and NR, NR is the master. The dual connectivity operation involving only NR serving cells (e.g. NR PCell and NR PSCells) is also envisaged.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Both standalone and non-standalone NR deployments are being standardized in 3GPP. The standalone deployments may be single or multi-carrier (e.g., NR CA or dual connectivity with NR PCell and NR PSCell). The non-standalone (NSA) deployment refers to a dual connectivity (DC) deployment involving E-UTRA and NR where there is LTE PCell and NR PSCell (there may also be one or more LTE SCells and one or more NR SCell). LTE PCell and NR PSCell are configured in MCG and SCG respectively. The MSG and SCG are more generally called as cell groups (CG). The MCG and SCG may be configured with one or more additional serving cells e.g. one or more LTE SCells in MCG and one or more SCells in SCG.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The measurement model used for UE RRM measurements in NR is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (based on TS 38.300). The UE measures one or more beams transmitted by a cell. The beam measurements results are averaged by the UE to derive the cell level measurement e.g. cell quality which can be any type of UE radio measurement. The UE uses up to the N best beams, including the one with the highest signal level and the remaining N-1 whose signal level (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, etc.) is above a configurable signal threshold, for deriving the cell level measurement. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the UE measures (e.g. beam level RSRP) up to K beams over physical layer (L1) measurement (e.g. using L1 filtering) at point A1. Out of these K beams the UE uses N best beams above signal threshold for deriving the cell quality (e.g. cell level RSRP etc.) at point B. The cell level measurement available at point B is based on a function to perform L1 filtering of the N best beams above the signal threshold. Examples of functions are average, xth percentile etc. The network node can further configure the UE to perform higher layer time domain filtering (e.g. L3 filtering) of beam level measurements and/or cell level measurements. In this case the UE may further perform higher layer time domain filtering of beams level L1 measurement results and/or cell level L1 measurement results as shown at point E and is point C respectively.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The measurements on K beams can be performed on any suitable signals configured by the network node e.g. on signals in SS block, CSI-RS resources, discovery signals, positioning reference signals etc. A SS block in NR transmits PSS, SSS and PBCH, where PBCH symbols also contain DMRS. RSRP, RSRQ and SINR measured on reference signals in SS block (e.g. SS/PBCH block) are also called as SS-RSRP. SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR respectively. RSRP, RSRQ and SINR measured on CSI-RS are also called as CSI-RSRP. CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR respectively. For simplicity generic terms like RSRP, RSRQ and SINR are used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It was later agreed in RAN2 that N can be set per reference signal, i.e., different values for SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS, within the measurement object. These parameters are the following:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">nroSS-BlocksToAverage:: INTEGER (2. . . maxNroSS-BlocksToAverage)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">nroCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage:: INTEGER (2. . . maxNroCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage)</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As in LTE, in NR the UE is also required to perform measurements (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, SINR etc.) on certain number of cells, such that measurement events (e.g. A1-A6) can be triggered and measurement reports can be transmitted from the UE to the network node.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in NR, these measurements shall be derived based on L1 filtered beam measurements on the further basis of SS/PBCH blocks (SSB) or CSI-RS resources. Further, the measurement performance of the cell level measurement is impacted by the total number of beams that are L1 filtered (even before the combination function where the average and/or selection of best beams are performed) and the signal level of the beams used to derive the cell level measurement. It should also be noted that the total number of beams per cell that the UE measures affects the performance of cell io measurement results.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, in NR, the UE may be configured to report beam measurement information, based on layer 3 filtered beam-level measurements. It has also been agreed that the network can configure the UE to report multiple quantities (e.g. RSRP, RSRQ, RSRP) for cells and beams, and they do not necessarily need to be consistent. This will require the UE to measure an even larger number of beams in total and possibly maintain a significant number of L1 filters. This is needed in some other scenarios e.g. when the network wants to reduce the ping-pong rate and needs more results per beam, or when the network wants to allocate more dedicated RACH resources per beam during handover. Hence, having more beam measurements per cell may improve performance in some scenarios. On the other hand, this will increase the UE complexity, memory and power consumption. Therefore, the applicant has appreciated that a solution is needed which can lead to a reasonable compromise between measurement performance, system impact and UE complexity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some scenarios, it is more important to have the UE measuring more cells and possibly triggering measurement reports (even though quality is perhaps based on fewer beam measurements); while in other scenario it is more important to have more beam measurements even though fewer cells are possibly triggering reports.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the UE does not know the measurement purpose assuming current information in reportConfig, measld and measObject, if it is limited in its measurement capacity, it does not have information to determine whether to prioritize measurements of more beams even if they are from the same cell, or to prioritize measurements of beams from different cells.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Cell level measurements are used for different purposes e.g. for mobility, positioning, radio resource management (RRM), etc. Furthermore, in some scenarios, a larger number of cells should be measured and reported by the UE.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In NR, as in LTE, the network can configure the UE with the exact measurement information to be reported by configuring a measurement identifier (measld) that links a carrier frequency to be measured (measObject), or more precisely a reference signal transmitted in a given carrier frequency, and a reporting configuration (reportConfig), io informing among other things the measurement quantities that should trigger an event (e.g. reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ) or signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR)), the measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report, which can be the same as the trigger quantity or combination of quantities (e.g. RSRP/RSRQ, RSRP/SINR, RSRQ/SINR, RSRP/RSRQ/SINR, etc.), is the reference signal to be measured (rsType), which can either be SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS and upper limits for the number of cells and beams to be included in a given measurement reports associated to the triggered measld. These two last fields are particularly interesting for the scope of the present disclosure, and they are defined in the current version of TS 38.331 as follows:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">maxReportCells:: INTEGER (1. . . maxCellReport)<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">Herein, maxCellReport is a constant associated to a requirement for the maximum number of reported cells in a given measurement report (whose value is 8 in LTE and has not been settled in NR yet)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">maxNroRsIndexesToReport:: INTEGER (1. . . maxNroIndexesToReport)<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0020">Herein, maxNroIndexesToReport is a constant associated to a requirement for the maximum number of reported beams in a given measurement report (not defined yet in NR and non-existing in LTE).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0021">An object of embodiments herein is to render the configuration of measurement requirements on cells and beams in NR more efficient.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to a first aspect there is presented a method for implementation in a user equipment (UE). The method involves receiving, from a network node, information indicating: a first number K of beams to be measured by the UE, and a second number L of cells in which the UE is required to measure the first number K of beams. The method further involves carrying out measurements using the received information; and performing at least one operational task based on a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">Advantageously this method may provide transmitting a message to the network node, which message reflects a capability of the UE to carry out measurements in agreement with the received information. This message is transmitted before the UE receives the information from the network node.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">The first number K may preferably specify either a total number of beams to be measured in all the second number L of cells, or a respective number of beams to be measured in each cell of the second number L of cells.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">According to a second aspect there is presented a UE for communication with a network node. The UE contains a radio interface and processing circuitry configured to: receive, from the network node, information indicating: a first number K of beams to be measured by the UE, and a second number L of cells in which the UE is required to measure the first number K of beams. The radio interface and processing circuitry are also configured to carry out measurements using the received information; and perform at least one operational task based on a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">According to a third aspect there is presented a method implemented in a network node, which method involves determining a first number K of beams to be measured by a UE and a second number L of cells in which the UE shall measure the first number K of beams. The method further involves transmitting information to the UE, which information indicates the first and second numbers K and L respectively.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">According to a fourth aspect there is presented a network node configured for communication with a UE. The network node contains a radio interface and processing circuitry configured to determine a first number K of beams to be measured by the UE and a second number L of cells in which the UE shall measure the first number K of beams. The radio interface and processing circuitry are also configured to transmit information to the UE, which information indicates the first and second numbers K and L respectively.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">According to a fifth aspect there is presented a computer program containing computer code which, when run on processing circuitry of a UE, causes the UE to: receive, from to the network node, information indicating: a first number K of beams to be measured by the UE, and a second number L of cells in which the UE is required to measure the first number K of beams; carry out measurements using the received information; and perform at least one operational task based on a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">According to a sixth aspect there is presented a computer program product containing a is computer-readable storage medium storing the above-defined computer program.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">According to a seventh aspect there is presented a computer program containing computer code which, when run on processing circuitry of a network node, causes the network node to be configured to: determine a first number K of beams to be measured by a UE and a second number L of cells in which the UE shall measure the first number K of beams; and transmit information to the UE, which information indicates the first and second numbers K and L respectively.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">According to an eighth aspect there is presented a computer program product containing a computer-readable storage medium storing the above-defined computer program.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">The above aspects provide flexibility to the network node, e.g. a base station. For example, it allows the network to dynamically configure the UE with the required number of cell level and beam level measurements depending on the use case and scenario. This may improve network performance, whilst limiting UE complexity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">By measuring larger number of beams per cell, the cell level signal quality may be enhanced. This, in turn, may enhance the UE mobility performance, which relies on the accuracy and reliability of the mobility measurements.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">By measuring larger number of beams per cell, the network can also configure the UE to report more granular L3 filtered beam measurements, so that mobility performance is improved in terms of handover ping-pong. Furthermore RLF/handover failure is avoided as a larger number of beam measurements allows the serving node to take better handover decisions and, configure more RACH resources per beam in the target cell.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">Further, by measuring a larger number of cells, there may be a benefit to the operators io who can benefit from knowledge of the presence of any weaker cells, such as positioning using fingerprint matching. This also enables load balancing. For example, measurement on larger number of cells enables the network to better distribute multiple UEs that require handovers across different cells.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">It is to be noted that any feature of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth aspects may be applied to any other aspect, wherever appropriate. Likewise, any advantage of the first aspect may equally apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth aspect respectively, and vice versa.

This proposed concept may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided by way of example so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the proposed concept to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">The UE may be configured by a network node with a combination of the number of beam measurements and cell measurements to be performed. The UE is then configured to perform measurement on a combination of at least K number of beams out of the set of detectable beams and at least L number of cells out of the set of detectable cells. The combination of (K, L) parameters also represents an upper limited to the network node for the parameters related to beam, cell reporting (i.e. maxNroRsIndexesToReport and) and cell quality derivation (nroSS-BlocksToAverage and nroCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage). In some embodiments the K number of beams and L number of cells have already been detected and the UE is required to perform measurements on these already detected K number of beams and L number of cells.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">In one example, the network node sets the requirement for K to the UE in such a way that all K beams belong to the same cell are to be measured by the UE e.g. L=1. In another example the K number of beams to be measured by the UE can belong to at least two io different cells (e.g. L=2). In yet another example, K is the number of beams per cell, and L is the number of cells. In yet another example, K is the total number of beams over multiple cells, and L is the number of cells. The UE can be configured with the combination of K beams and L cells by explicit signaling and/or via implicit signaling (e.g. indication is associated with the type of measurement, purpose of the measurement etc.). The UE is uses the received signaling information for performing the measurements on at least K beams and at least L cells provided that their respective received signal levels are detectable (e.g. if SINR&#x2265;&#x2212;6 dB as a minimum requirement). The UE further uses the results of the measurements for performing one or more operational tasks (e.g. triggering measurement events based on cell measurement results, according to what is configured in reportConfig, reporting cell measurement results to the network node, including L3 filtered beam measurement results in measurement reports, use them for cell reselection, etc.). K and L can be used to prioritize measurements of more beams from the same cell, or to prioritize measurement of beams from different cells.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">In some embodiments, different granularities are described with which the parameters K and L can be configured by the network node, such as per carrier frequency, per measurement object, per UE (i.e. within measConfig for all configured measurement identifiers), per reportConfig (e.g. per event), per frequency range, per measurement quantity, per RS type (e.g. SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS) or any combination of the listed possibilities.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">In order to be configured by the network node with the parameters K and L, the UE may indicate to the network node a UE measurement capability or capacity in terms of the total number of physical layer L1 measurements that it can perform, including cells and beams or different combinations of the measurements. This enables the network node to ensure that the configured values of K and L do not exceed the UE measurement capability/capacity.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">In the below description, the non-limiting term &#x201c;UE&#x201d; is used. The UE may be any type of wireless device capable of communicating with network node or another UE over radio signals. The UE may also be radio communication device, target device, device to device to (D2D) UE, machine type UE or UE capable of machine to machine communication (M2M), target device, a sensor equipped with UE, iPAD, Tablet, mobile terminals, smart phone, laptop embedded equipped (LEE), laptop mounted equipment (LME), USB dongles, Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) etc.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">In some embodiments the generic terminology &#x201c;network node&#x201d;, is used. Here, the network node can be any kind of the following nodes: a radio network node (e.g. a base station, radio base station, base transceiver station, base station controller, network controller, gNB, en-gNB, nr-eNB, NR BS, evolved Node B (eNB), Node B, Multi-cell/multicast Coordination Entity (MCE), relay node, access point, radio access point, Remote Radio Unit (RRU) Remote Radio Head (RRH), a multi-standard BS (a.k.a. MSR BS), a core network node (e.g., MME, SON node, a coordinating node, positioning node (e.g. location server, SMLC, E-SMLC etc.), MDT node, etc.), or an external node (e.g., 3rd party node, a node external to the current network), etc. Moreover, the network node may contain test equipment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">The term &#x201c;radio node&#x201d; used in this disclosure denotes a UE or a radio network node.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">The described embodiments are applicable to single carrier as well as to multicarrier operation of the UE. Examples of multicarrier operation are carrier aggregation (CA), multi-connectivity (MC) etc. In CA operation the UE is able to receive and/or transmit data to more than one serving cells. In MC the UE is served by at least two serving cells (e.g. PCell and PSCell) operated by two different network nodes. The term carrier aggregation (CA) is also called (e.g. interchangeably called) &#x201c;multi-carrier system&#x201d;, &#x201c;multi-cell operation&#x201d;, &#x201c;multi-carrier operation&#x201d;, &#x201c;multi-carrier&#x201d; transmission and/or reception. In CA one of the component carriers (CCs) is the primary component carrier (PCC) or simply primary carrier or even anchor carrier. The remaining ones are called secondary component carrier (SCC) or simply secondary carriers or even supplementary carriers. The serving cell is interchangeably called as primary cell (PCell) or primary serving cell (PSC). Similarly, the secondary serving cell is interchangeably called as secondary cell (SCell) or secondary serving cell (SSC).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">The term &#x201c;signaling&#x201d; used in this disclosure may include anything of the following: high-layer signaling (e.g., via RRC, NAS message or a like), lower-layer signaling (e.g., via a MAC, a physical control channel etc.), or a combination thereof. The signaling may be implicit or explicit. The signaling may further be unicast, multicast or broadcast. The signaling may also be directly to another node or via a third node.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">The term &#x201c;radio measurement&#x201d; used in this disclosure may refer to any measurement performed on radio signals. Radio measurements can be absolute or relative. Radio is measurement may be called as signal level which may be signal quality and/or signal strength. Radio measurements can be e.g. intra-frequency, inter-frequency, CA, etc. The measurements may be cell measurements. The measurement can be performed on one or more cells operating on a frequency layer (e.g. cell specific measurement and/or on a carrier frequency (e.g. carrier specific measurement) which may be common for more than one cells on that carrier. Radio measurements can be unidirectional (e.g., DL or UL) or bidirectional (e.g., RTT, Rx-Tx, etc.). Some examples of radio measurements: timing measurements (e.g., TOA, timing advance, RTT, RSTD, Rx-Tx, propagation delay, etc.), angle measurements (e.g., angle of arrival), power-based measurements (e.g., received signal power, RSRP, SS-RSRP, received signal quality, RSRQ, SS-RSRQ, SINR, SS-SINR, SNR, interference power, total interference plus noise, RSSI, noise power, etc.), cell detection or cell identification, radio link monitoring (RLM), system information (SI) reading, etc.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The term &#x201c;measurement performance&#x201d; used in this disclosure may refer to any criteria or metric which characterizes the performance of the measurement performed by a radio node. The term measurement performance is also called as measurement requirement, measurement performance requirements etc. The radio node has to meet one or more measurement performance criteria related to the performed measurement. Examples of measurement performance criteria are measurement time, number of cells to be measured with the measurement time, measurement reporting delay, measurement accuracy, measurement accuracy with respect to a reference value (e.g. ideal measurement result) etc. Examples of measurement time are measurement period, cell identification period, evaluation period, etc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">The term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; (or &#x201c;frequency layer&#x201d;) used in this disclosure may correspond to any carrier frequency of any radio access technology (RAT) e.g. LTE, HSPA, NR etc. The to layer is interchangeably called as carrier frequency, carrier frequency layer, frequency, intra-frequency carrier, inter-frequency carrier, inter-RAT carrier frequency, serving carrier frequency, non-serving carrier etc.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, we will describe a method performed in a UE when receiving and using beam and cell configuration information for measurements according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">Step <b>410</b> (optional): Indicate to another network node, the UE's capability related to at least one of K and L, e.g., the maximum of or the supported range of K and/or L. In this embodiment, the method comprises, prior to step <b>420</b>, transmitting a message to the network node, which message reflects a capability of the UE to carry out measurements, for example cell measurements.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">Step <b>420</b>: Receive from a network node, information about K number of beams (either total number of beams to be measured over multiple cells, or beams to be measured per cell) and L number of cells which the UE is required to measure. In this embodiment, the method comprises receiving, from a network node, information indicating a first number (K) of beams to be measured and a second number (L) of cells in which the UE is required to measure the first number (K) of beams. The first number (K) of beams may be measured qualitatively by the UE. The first number (K) may specify either a total number of beams to be measured in all the second number (L) of cells, or a respective number of beams to be measured in each cell of the second number (L) of cells.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">Step <b>430</b>: Use the received information to perform i.e. carry out measurements, for example cell measurements and optionally, if configured, L3 beam measurements. In this embodiment, the method comprises carrying out measurements using the received information e.g. carrying out measurements in agreement with the received information. The measurements may be cell measurements.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">Step <b>440</b>: Use the results of the measurements to perform one or more operational tasks. Thus, the method may comprise performing at least one operational task based on a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">To implement this method, a UE that is configured to communicate with a network node to may have a radio interface and processing circuitry specifically configured to:</p><p id="p-0065" num="0066">receive, from the network node, information indicating: a first number K of beams to be measured by the UE, and a second number L of cells in which the UE is required to measure the first number K of beams;</p><p id="p-0066" num="0067">carry out measurements using the received information; and</p><p id="p-0067" num="0068">perform at least one operational task based on a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0069">Preferably, the radio interface and the processing circuitry are further configured to transmit a message to the network node, which message reflects a capability of the UE to carry out measurements in agreement with the received information, and which message is transmitted before the UE receives the information from the network node.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">According to one embodiment the UE receives information from a network node, the information comprising/indicating a set of K number of beams and L number of cells for performing measurements. The configuration of K and L provides means to the network node to configure the UE with one of a plurality of UE measurement requirements in terms of the minimum number K of beams and the minimum number L cells which the UE is required to measure. This leads to flexibility and enables the network node to ensure that the UE meets the measurement requirements (K and L values) associated with or relevant to the scenario e.g. mobility, positioning etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0071">In one example, K is the number of beams per cell, and L is the number of cells. In yet another example, K is the total number of beams over multiple cells, and L is the number of cells. K and L may be further associated with and depend on a carrier frequency. In other words, K and/or L can be signaled in the measurement object (measObject) to the UE. K and L can also be set per RS type, i.e., different values for SS/PBCH block measurements and CSI-Rs measurements. Even if set per RS type, that can also be set within the measObject.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">K and L can be further associated and set per frequency range, e.g., below 6 GHz and above 6 GHz. In that case, K and L can be configured in the measConfig where pairs are defined for these ranges and the UE uses them by matching the configured measurement identifiers (measId) associated with the measurement objects (measObject).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0073">K and L may also be further associated and depend on a type of a measurement e.g., either intra-frequency and inter-frequency, periodical or even triggered, etc. K and L may also be further associated and depend on more detailed signal parameters such as a bandwidth (e.g., UE bandwidth, channel bandwidth, measurement bandwidth, etc.). K may also further be associated with and depend on the cell type, e.g., serving cell or neighbor cell, so in principle there may be K1 beams for one or all serving cells and K2 beams for one or all neighbor cells.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074">K and L may be associated to White Listed Cells. If the network configures for a given carrier 5 white listed cells, the UE derives that L=5 cells and K is distributed across all 5 cells, if detected. In that case, only K may need to be explicitly signaled.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0075">K and L may be associated to white listed beams or equivalent concept. If the network configures for a given frequency CSI-RS resource where each configuration can be associated to a beam, the UE knows exactly how many detectable beams to expect. In other words, the UE can derive that the number K is the number of configured CSI-RS resources per measurement object. And, in that case, only L may need to be explicitly signaled. Or, alternatively, the UE also derives L based on the number of cells it has configure it for the CSI-RS resources.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">The UE may be required to perform measurements on at least K number of beams and at least L number of cells provided that the received signal levels from the beams and cells are detectable. It is expected that standards will specify minimum requirements (e.g. thresholds) at which UEs are expected to be able to detect cells. It may also be so that to find and track at least K good enough beams the UE needs to measure on more than L cells, and the other way around&#x2014;to find and track at least L good enough cells (e.g., whose signal quality is above a certain threshold e.g. SINR is above &#x2212;6 dB).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">In a further embodiment, the number of beams configured for any cell level measurements shall not exceed K when it is the number of beams per cell. Even if the UE is configured with X&#x3e;K for a cell measurement, the UE may assume X&#x2032;=min(X, K) and use it for performing the cell measurement. Notice here that the value X is equivalent to the current parameter in the 38.331 specification defined for SS/PBCH block and CSI-RS io respectively as nroSS-BlocksToAverage and nroCSI-RS-ResourcesToAverage, defined within each measObject.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">The number of beams for cell-level measurements and thus K may also be selected in association with a threshold above which the beam measurements shall be considered by the UE. The lower threshold would typically allow a larger number of beams and would also result in a lower cell-level measurement as compared to when the cell-level measurement is based on the best beam only.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">The parameter K may also be used when configuring the set of RLM-RS resources, e.g., the number of RLM-RS resources for the UE shall not exceed K beams per cell for that UE.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">The received signal level at the UE corresponds to received power of any one or more signals (e.g., reference signals, synchronization signals, SSB, DMRS, CSI-RS, etc.) transmitted by another node e.g. by a base station. Examples of received signal levels are RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, SNR, SS-SINR, SCH &#xca;s/lot, CRS &#xca;s/lot SSB &#xca;s/lot, CSI-RS &#xca;s/lot etc. Where in &#xca;s/lot, &#xca;s is the ratio of received energy per RE (power normalized to the subcarrier spacing) during the useful part of the symbol, i.e. excluding the cyclic prefix, at the UE antenna and lot is the received power spectral density of the total noise and interference for a certain RE (power integrated over the RE and normalized to the subcarrier spacing) as measured at the UE antenna. Examples of signal thresholds are SSB Es/lot of &#x2212;6 dB, SS-RSRP of &#x2212;115 dBm etc. Herein, SSB is Synchronization Signal Block or SS/PBCH Block, and an SSB signal level is a signal level for one or more of the signals/channels comprised in the SSB. SS is for Synchronization Signal.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">In one exemplary implementation the UE may be configured to apply the same set of K number of beams and L number of cells for doing measurement on signals of two or more carrier frequencies. As an example in this case K=32 and L=8 shall be used by the UE for doing measurements on intra-frequency carrier as well as on an inter-frequency carrier. In another exemplary implementation the UE may be configured with a separate set of K number of beams and L number of cells for measurement on signals of each carrier frequency. As an example in this case K=32 and L=8 shall be used by the UE to for doing measurements on intra-frequency carrier while K=32 and L=4 shall be used for doing measurements on an inter-frequency carrier.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">The UE may determine the set of K and L number of beams and cells respectively by receiving an explicit information from the network node and/or by receiving an implicit information from the network node. In explicit signaling mechanisms, the network node is provides explicit information such as pre-defined identifier of the set of K and L values to the UE. The signaling information comprising a pre-defined identifier of a set of K and L values may provide an efficient signaling mechanism. On the other hand, in case of implicit determination the UE determines the set of K and L values which is association with implicit information received from the network node. These two cases are further elaborated below.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">Several examples of explicitly signaling the information about a set of K number of beams and L number of cells by the network node to the UE are described below.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">In a generic example in table 1, the UE can be configured with any one of M possible sets of K number of beams and L number of cells for doing the measurements on one or more carriers e.g. PCC, SCC, PSC, non-serving carrier etc. For example the UE can be configured with one of the pre-defined identifiers of the M possible combination sets.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>An example of M combination sets of K beams and L cells</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Combination Set No.</entry><entry>K beams</entry><entry>L cells</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>K1</entry><entry>L1</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>K2</entry><entry>L2</entry></row><row><entry>. . .</entry><entry>. . .</entry><entry>. . .</entry></row><row><entry>M</entry><entry>Km</entry><entry>Lm</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0085" num="0085">In an example in table 2, the UE can be configured with any one of 8 possible sets of K number of beams and L number of cells for doing the measurements on one or more carriers e.g. PCC, SCC, PSC, non-serving carrier etc. For example, the UE can be configured by the network node with any set comprising fewer cells (e.g. set no. 1, 2 or 3) for doing measurements which are used for the purpose of mobility. Examples of mobility scenarios are cell selection, cell change etc. Examples of cell change are cell reselection, handover, RRC connection release with redirection etc. The UE can be configured by the network node with any set comprising moderate number of cells (e.g. set no. 4 or 5) for doing measurements which are used for the purpose of network planning related tasks. Examples of such tasks are self-organizing network (SON) functionality or tuning of network configuration parameters (e.g. transmit power of network node, number of antenna ports, transmit power of reference signals (e.g. PSS, SSS, DMRS etc.), measurement bandwidth, power offset between physical channel and is reference signal etc.). The UE can be configured by the network node with any set comprising larger number of cells (e.g. set no. 6, 7 or 8) for doing measurements which are used for determining the position of the UE. Examples of positioning methods are enhanced cell ID method, pattern matching, fingerprinting, hybrid positioning which combines two or more positioning methods etc. For example in pattern matching or fingerprinting positioning or OTDOA, which rely on mapping between signal measurements and the location and may even require at least 5-6 signals from different locations (e.g., OTDOA), the measurements on larger number of cells will improve positioning accuracy of the UE or will even make the positioning possible at all. In yet another example, ensuring that the UE reports measurements for two or more cells may also be more important when the UE is approaching or appears at the cell edge and/or moving with a high speed (or speed above a threshold) and therefore may need to perform HO soon, so good cell candidates are needed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>An example of 8 sets of 32 beams and L (1 to 8) cells</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="105pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Combination Set No.</entry><entry>K beams</entry><entry>L cells</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="105pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry>6</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry>7</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>7</entry></row><row><entry>8</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In an example in table 3 the UE can be configured with any one of 4 possible sets of K number of beams and L number of cells for doing the measurements on one or more carriers e.g. PCC, SCC, PSC, non-serving carrier etc. This example of combination sets can also be used for measurements for various purposes (e.g. mobility, positioning etc.) as described in example 2 (for table 2).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>An example of 4 sets of 32 beams and L (1 to 8) cells</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Combination Set No.</entry><entry>K beams</entry><entry>L cells</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>32</entry><entry>8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">In an example in table 4 the UE can be configured with any one of 2 possible sets of K number of beams and L number of cells for doing the measurements on one or more to carriers e.g. PCC, SCC, PSC, non-serving carrier etc. This example of combination sets can be used for measurements for mobility (e.g. set no.1) and for positioning and for network planning (e.g. set no. 2) etc.).
