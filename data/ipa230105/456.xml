The adjustment device is connected to the counterweight <b>4</b>, and may drive the counterweight <b>4</b> to move along a surface of the base <b>3</b>.

The first piston rod <b>51</b> moves with the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> in the third direction, and pushes the first piston to move in the first direction, such that the volume of the first space is reduced. Since the first piston and the second piston are both sealingly connected to the inner wall of the cylinder block <b>521</b>, when the volume of the first space decreases, the pressure of the medium in the first space may increase. In addition, the first piston pushes the medium in the first space to the second space, such that the medium in the second space increases, and thereby the pressure increases. Thus, the second piston is pushed to move in a direction opposite to the third direction.

Thus, in order to ensure that the gravity center is still at the preset position, the mass of the counterweight <b>4</b> may be reduced to be smaller than the mass of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>. The cross-sectional area of the first cavity <b>523</b> along the first plane is S<b>1</b>, and the cross-sectional area of the second cavity <b>524</b> along the first plane is S<b>2</b>.

The strain sensor <b>92</b> is configured to detect the strain value of the C-arm X-ray apparatus.

During the movement of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, the position where the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> and the support column <b>2</b> contact will occur changes, which causes the lower surface of the C-arm translation assembly I to undergo a great deformation. In addition, the strain refers to a ratio of the deformation amount to the original size. During the movement of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, there will be deformations in many parts of the C-arm X-ray apparatus, thus the strain values in many parts of the C-arm X-ray apparatus may change accordingly. During the movement of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, a side surface of the support column <b>2</b> and a lower surface of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> may both undergo great deformations.

It is necessary to determine a correspondence between the first strain value, the second strain value and the movement distance of the C-arm translation assembly I through experiments before the movement of the counterweight <b>4</b> driven by the controls of the controller. Here is a brief introduction to the experimental process, which includes steps of moving the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, and recording its movement distance, and meanwhile recording the first strain value and the second strain value corresponding to the movement distance. Then, the steps mentioned above are repeated until acquiring enough data samples. After a lot of experiments, the correspondence between the movement distance of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, the first strain value and second strain value may be acquired, Therefore, the movement distance of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> may be inferred from the first strain value and/or the second strain value as detected by the strain sensor <b>92</b>. After detecting the first strain value and/or the second strain value, the strain sensor <b>92</b> sends the value to the controller. Then, the controller controls the driver assembly to work, and control the counterweight <b>4</b> to move by a preset distance.

The preset information includes the pressure value. The state of C-arm X-ray apparatus includes a moving state and a balanced state. In the case that the C-arm X-ray apparatus is in the balanced state, the two pressure values detected by each row of the weighing sensors <b>93</b> are equal.

In this embodiment, only one row of weighing sensors <b>93</b> may be provided; at this time, the number of the weighing sensors <b>93</b> is two, which are A and B, respectively. The A and B are respectively disposed on two sides of the preset position, and the three are disposed on a same straight line along the first direction. When the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> moves in the fourth direction, the C-arm X-ray apparatus is in the moving state, where the fourth direction is directed to B from the preset position. In this case, the pressure value detected by B may increase, Whereas the pressure value detected by A may decrease; thus the controller may determine that the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> moves in the fourth direction, and then control the driver assembly to drive the counterweight <b>4</b> to move in a direction opposite to the fourth direction until the pressure value as detected by A and the pressure value as detected by B are equal again.

A line where A and B are located is the same as the first direction, and a line where C and D are located is the same as the first direction. Whereas a line where A and C are located is perpendicular to a line where A and B are located, and a line where B and D are located is perpendicular to a line where A and C are located. The moving portion is provided with a rotation shaft inside. An end of the rotation shaft is connected to the C-arm, and the rotation shaft is disposed along the first direction. The C-arm translation assembly I may rotate about an axis that is a straight line on which the rotation shaft is disposed. During the rotation, the gravity center of the C-arm X-ray apparatus may be offset in a direction perpendicular to the first direction. In the initial state, the pressure values of A and C are equal, and the pressure values of B and D are equal. After entering the moving state, the pressure values of A and C change, and the pressure values of B and D change. When the gravity center moves towards C. the pressure value of C increases, from which the offset direction of the gravity center may he interred. Furthermore, an auxiliary counterweight <b>4</b> is provided and slidably connected to the base <b>3</b>, thus the auxiliary counterweight <b>4</b> can move in a direction perpendicular to the first direction to match the offset of the counterweight <b>4</b> in this direction, so as to remain the gravity center in the preset position.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Exemplarily, the C-arm X-ray apparatus further includes four casters <b>10</b> that are disposed on sides, facing away from the base <b>3</b>, of the weighing sensors <b>93</b> respectively.

Therefore, the effect of the present disclosure can be achieved by only adding the support member <b>32</b>, the adjustment device, and the like without changing the support base <b>31</b> in the prior art. In addition, in order to ensure that the overall weight of the C-arm X-ray apparatus is small, it is possible to reduce the thickness of the support base <b>31</b>. However, since it also requires to ensure the height of the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b>, the support column <b>2</b> is configured to have a rather great height and supports the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> to the first preset height, which thereby causes a rather great distance between the C-arm translation assembly <b>1</b> and the base <b>3</b>.
