However, with the present metal processing technique, it is difficult to form openings in a large metal plate with high precision, which cannot respond to enhancement in definition of the openings.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, in the case of a vapor deposition mask constituted of only a metal, the mass thereof also increases with upsizing, and the total mass including a frame also increases, which becomes a hindrance to handling.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Under such circumstances, in Patent Document 1, there is proposed a method for producing a vapor deposition mask including a metal mask in which slits are provided and a resin mask which is positioned on the surface of the metal mask and in which openings corresponding to a pattern to be produced by vapor deposition are arranged for a plurality of rows in the lengthwise direction and in the crosswise direction, the metal mask and the resin mask being stacked. The method for producing the vapor deposition mask proposed in Patent Document 1 is regarded as being capable of producing the vapor deposition mask that satisfies both high definition and lightweight in upsizing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, Patent Document 1 above discloses that in order to suppress generation of a shadow in production by vapor deposition using a vapor deposition mask, the sectional shape of the opening or the sectional shape of the slit is preferably a shape having broadening toward the vapor deposition source side. Notably, the shadow is a phenomenon that a part of a vapor deposition material released from a vapor deposition source collides with inner wall surfaces of the slit of the metal mask and/or the opening of the resin mask and does not reach the vapor deposition target, and thereby, a portion without vapor deposition that has a film thickness smaller than the intended vapor deposition film thickness arises.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 5288073</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of an embodiment of the present invention is a further improvement of the method for producing a vapor deposition mask proposed in Patent Document 1 above, and a primary object thereof is to provide a method for producing a vapor deposition mask and a vapor deposition mask producing apparatus capable of achieving lightweight even when upsized and capable of forming a vapor deposition pattern with higher definition than a conventional one by suppressing generation of a so-called shadow, further, a laser mask used in these producing method and producing apparatus, and furthermore, a method for producing an organic semiconductor element capable of producing an organic semiconductor element with higher definition than a conventional one.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is provided a method for producing a vapor deposition mask according to an embodiment of the present invention, including: a step of preparing a resin plate-equipped metal mask including a metal mask in which a slit is provided and a resin plate, the metal mask and the resin plate being stacked;

Hereafter, the individual steps are described.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">(Step of Preparing Resin Plate-Equipped Metal Mask)</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, this step is a step of preparing a resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> including a metal mask <b>10</b> in which slits <b>15</b> are provided and a resin plate <b>30</b>, the metal mask and the resin plate being stacked. When the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> is prepared, first, the metal mask <b>10</b> in which the slits <b>15</b> are provided is prepared. Notably, details of the materials and the like of the metal mask <b>10</b> and the resin plate <b>30</b> are described alongside when a vapor deposition mask produced by a producing method of an embodiment of the present invention is described.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The metal mask <b>10</b> is constituted of metal, in which the slits <b>15</b> extending in the lengthwise direction and/or the crosswise direction are arranged. Openings <b>25</b> are formed at a position overlapping with the slits <b>15</b> in the resin plate constituting the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> in a step mentioned later.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a method of forming the metal mask <b>10</b> in which the slits <b>15</b> are provided, for example, the following method can be cited.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, a masking member, for example, a resist material is applied onto the surface of a metal plate, predetermined portions thereof are exposed and developed, and thereby, a resist pattern in which positions where the slits <b>15</b> are finally to be formed remain is formed. The resist material used as the masking member is preferably excellent in processing ability with desired resolution. Next, etching processing is performed by an etching method using this resist pattern as an etching resistant mask. Next, after the completion of the etching, the resist pattern is cleaned and removed. In this way, the metal mask <b>10</b> in which the slits <b>15</b> are provided is obtained. The etching for forming the slits <b>15</b> may be performed on one surface side of the metal plate or may be performed on both surfaces thereof. Moreover, in the case where the slits <b>15</b> are formed in the metal plate using a stacked body in which the resin plate is provided on the metal plate, the masking member may be applied onto the surface of the metal plate on the side that is not in contact with the resin plate to form the slits <b>15</b> by the etching from one surface side. Notably, in the case where the resin plate has etching resistance with respect to the etching agent for the metal plate, masking of the surface of the resin plate is not needed. Meanwhile, in the case where the resin plate does not have resistance with respect to the etching agent for the metal plate, the masking member is needed to be applied onto the surface of the resin plate. Moreover, in the above, while the case where the resist material is used as the masking member is exemplarily described, in place of the application of the resist material, a dry film resist may be laminated to perform the similar patterning. Notably, the metal mask <b>10</b> constituting the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> is not limited to one formed by the method exemplified above but can also employ a commercial product. Moreover, in place of the formation of the slits <b>15</b> by etching, the slits <b>15</b> can also be formed by irradiation with laser light.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A method of pasting the metal mask <b>10</b> and the resin plate <b>30</b> constituting the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> together and a forming method thereof are not specially limited. For example, the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> can also be obtained by beforehand preparing a stacked body formed by coating of a resin layer with respect to a metal plate to be the metal mask <b>10</b>, and forming the slits <b>15</b> in the metal plate in the state of the stacked body. In the present embodiment, the resin plate <b>30</b> constituting the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> includes not only a plate-like resin but also a resin layer and a resin film formed by coating as mentioned above. In other words, the resin plate <b>30</b> may be beforehand prepared or may be formed by a conventionally known coating method or the like. Moreover, the resin plate <b>30</b> is a concept including a resin film and a resin sheet. Moreover, the hardness of the resin plate <b>30</b> is not limited but it may be a hard plate or a soft plate. Moreover, the metal mask <b>10</b> and the resin plate <b>30</b> may be pasted together with various adhesive agents or the resin plate <b>30</b> that has self-adhesion may be used. Notably, the dimensions of the metal mask <b>10</b> and the resin plate <b>30</b> may be the same. Notably, with fixing of a vapor deposition mask <b>100</b> produced by the producing method of the present embodiment to a frame <b>50</b> taken into consideration, the dimension of the resin plate <b>30</b> may be made smaller than that of the metal plate <b>10</b> to set the outer circumferential portion of the metal mask <b>10</b> to be in the state of exposure, which facilitates welding of the metal mask <b>10</b> to the frame <b>50</b>.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">(Step of Fixing to Frame)</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the metal mask <b>10</b> constituting the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> is fixed to the frame <b>50</b>. While in the present embodiment, this fixing step is an arbitrary step, since in the case of using the vapor deposition mask <b>100</b> in a typical vapor deposition apparatus, it is often fixed to the frame <b>50</b> to be used, this step is preferably performed in this timing. On the other hand, not shown in the figure, a fixing step of fixing the metal mask <b>10</b> at the prestage of the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> to a frame may be performed, after that, to provide the resin plate <b>30</b>. A method of fixing the metal mask <b>10</b> to the frame <b>50</b> is not specially limited but, for example, in the case where the frame <b>50</b> includes metal, a conventionally known step or method such as spot welding only has to be properly employed.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">(Step of Forming Openings in Resin Plate)</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, openings corresponding to a pattern to be produced by vapor deposition are formed in the resin plate <b>30</b> by irradiation with a laser from the metal mask <b>10</b> side of the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b>. The present embodiment is characterized in using a laser mask <b>70</b> as shown in the figure at this stage. Notably, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the laser mask <b>70</b> is disposed spaced from the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b>, it is not limited to this figure. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a condenser lens <b>130</b> may be installed between the laser mask <b>70</b> and the resin plate-equipped metal mask <b>40</b> to form the openings by a so-called &#x201c;laser processing method using a reducing projection optical system&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The laser mask <b>70</b> is provided with opening regions <b>71</b> corresponding to patterns to be produced by vapor deposition, in other words, corresponding to openings formed in the final stage, and attenuating regions <b>72</b> that are positioned in the peripheries of the opening regions <b>71</b> and attenuate the energy of the laser of the irradiation. By using such a laser mask <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, openings <b>25</b> corresponding to the patterns to be produced by vapor deposition can be formed in the resin plate <b>30</b> with the laser that passes through the opening regions <b>71</b>, and thin parts <b>26</b> not penetrating can be simultaneously formed in the peripheries of the openings <b>25</b> with the laser whose energy is attenuated by passing through the attenuating regions <b>72</b>, affording the vapor deposition mask <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">By forming the thin parts <b>26</b> in the peripheries of the openings <b>25</b>, generation of a so-called shadow can be suppressed in the case where the patterns are produced by vapor deposition using the vapor deposition mask <b>100</b>, which can improve pattern precision. Moreover, by simultaneously forming the openings <b>25</b> along with the thin parts <b>26</b> positioned in the peripheries thereof as in the present embodiment, dimensional precision can be dramatically improved.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hereafter, the laser mask used in the method for producing a vapor deposition mask of the present embodiment is described using the figures.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">(Laser Mask)</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an elevation view of the laser mask used in the method for producing a vapor deposition mask of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the laser mask <b>70</b>, the opening regions <b>71</b> corresponding to the patterns to be produced by vapor deposition, in other words, corresponding to the openings formed in the final stage, and the attenuating regions <b>72</b> that are positioned in the peripheries of the opening regions <b>71</b> and attenuate the energy of the laser of the irradiation are provided as described above using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Here, the opening regions <b>71</b> are not specially mentioned but through holes corresponding to patterns to be produced by vapor deposition or the like are the opening regions <b>71</b>. Accordingly, the shape of the opening region <b>71</b> is not limited to be rectangular as shown in the figure but, when the pattern to be produced by vapor deposition is circular, the shape of the opening region <b>71</b> is also correspondingly circular in the nature of things, and when the pattern to be produced by vapor deposition is hexagonal, the shape of the opening region <b>71</b> is also hexagonal. Notably, while the transmittance of the laser in the opening region <b>71</b> is 100% when the opening region <b>71</b> is a through hole, it is not necessarily 100% but can be properly designed in its relative relation to the transmittance of the laser in the attenuating region <b>72</b> mentioned later. In other words, the &#x201c;opening region <b>71</b>&#x201d; in an embodiment of the present invention is a region for forming an opening formed in a vapor deposition mask in the final stage, and the opening region <b>71</b> itself is not necessarily in the state of opening like a through hole. Accordingly, the effect can be achieved, for example, even when the transmittance of the laser in the opening region <b>71</b> is 70% and the transmittance of the laser in the attenuating region <b>72</b> mentioned later is 50%.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The attenuating regions <b>72</b> are formed for the purpose to form the thin parts <b>26</b> in the peripheries of the openings <b>25</b> of the resin plate <b>30</b> with the laser having passed through the attenuating regions <b>72</b> in timing when the openings <b>25</b> are formed in the resin plate <b>30</b> with the laser having passed through the opening regions <b>71</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, by them positioned in the peripheries of the opening regions <b>71</b> and attenuating the energy of the laser of the irradiation. Accordingly, a specific mode of the attenuating region <b>72</b> is not specially limited but it only has to be a mode in which the energy of the laser can be attenuated to an extent where thinness can be achieved without penetrating the resin plate <b>30</b> that is positioned in the periphery of the opening <b>25</b> in timing of the aforementioned effect, in other words, when the opening <b>25</b> is formed, and the transmittance of the laser in the attenuating region <b>72</b> is preferably set to be about 50% or less.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, by forming through grooves <b>74</b> having opening widths smaller than a resolution of the laser of the irradiation concentrically in the periphery of the opening region <b>71</b>, that is, forming so-called line-and-space, the relevant portion may be set to be the attenuating region <b>72</b>.

Notably, the reducing rate of the optical system of the laser processing apparatus is calculated from (the size of the opening region on the laser mask)/(the size of the opening on the vapor deposition mask).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, the &#x201c;resolution of the laser&#x201d; in the present specification is the lower limit value of line-and-space that can be formed when the line-and-space constituted of through grooves is formed with respect to a resin plate as a processing target.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, the dimension of the attenuating region <b>72</b>, in other words, the distance from the end side of the opening region <b>71</b> to the end side of the attenuating region <b>72</b> is not specially limited but it only has to be properly designed with the dimension of the thin part <b>26</b> to be formed in the periphery of the opening of the resin mask in the final stage and the distance between the openings <b>25</b> taken into consideration.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>N</figref> are expanded elevation views of various laser masks for explaining specific modes of the opening region and the attenuating region.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>J</figref>, the attenuating region <b>72</b> may be disposed so as to form the through grooves <b>74</b> having opening widths smaller than the resolution of the laser of the irradiation concentrically in the periphery of the opening region <b>71</b>, that is, to form so-called line-and-space.
