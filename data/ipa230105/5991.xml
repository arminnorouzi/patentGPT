A photovoltaic element consists of at least one photovoltaic cell comprising at least one photoactive layer, which can be connected in series or in parallel. Photovoltaic elements or photovoltaic cells thereof connected in series are not always all shaded to the same extent, but are still partly exposed to sunlight. In this case, shaded photovoltaic cells connected in series with others generate an opposite voltage compared to non-shaded photovoltaic cells that restrict or block the flow of current from the other photovoltaic cells through that photovoltaic cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods known from the prior art for circumventing the problem of partial shading use bypass diodes in order to continue to ensure the flow of current of the photovoltaic cells connected in series and to avoid damage to the partly shaded photovoltaic cell. In the case of a shaded or defective photovoltaic cell, the power loss is reduced by connecting a bypass diode in parallel with the photovoltaic cell. If a photovoltaic element, in particular a photovoltaic cell of the photovoltaic element, is at least partly shaded, this photovoltaic cell generates no voltage or a lower voltage, and the current generated by the photovoltaic cells connected in series upstream of it cannot be conducted and damages the at least partly shaded photovoltaic cell. In such a case, the bypass diode can take over the conduction of the generated current from photovoltaic cells connected upstream to photovoltaic cells connected downstream through the bypass diode, thereby preventing damage to the shaded photovoltaic cell. A photovoltaic element can thus continue to function in an at least partly shaded photovoltaic cell. However, such a solution is very costly and requires a high level of complexity, which also leads to high additional costs.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">US20150349164A1 discloses a solar cell comprising an integrated bypass diode, wherein the bypass diode and the solar cell include different areas next to each other on the substrate and are separated by a gap.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 1 920 468 B1 discloses organic photovoltaic cells comprising a bypass diode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO2014/051889A1 discloses a solar cell comprising a large number of photovoltaic cells, wherein the photovoltaic cells have a specific arrangement of intermediate spaces, such that the resulting areas of the cells allow only a maximum opposing voltage, and a number of bypass diodes can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disadvantage of the prior art, however, is that the integration of a complete bypass diode in photovoltaic cells during production has proven to be complex. The bypass diodes require a larger area that can no longer produce current, resulting in a greater power loss of the photovoltaic elements.

In particular, there should be as little active area loss as possible and there should be only a minimal influence on the performance.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, a photovoltaic element is provided, which comprises at least one photovoltaic cell, having a base electrode, a top electrode, and a layer system comprising at least one photoactive layer, wherein the layer system is arranged between the base electrode and the top electrode. The at least one photovoltaic cell is at least partly segmented into segments, wherein the segmentation is designed in such a way that at least the top electrode and the layer system of one segment are separated from the top electrode and the layer system of another segment, or the top electrode, the layer system and at least partly the base electrode of one segment are separated from the top electrode, the layer system and at least partly the base electrode of another segment in each case by at least one cavity so as to prevent contact between one another, wherein the at least one cavity is formed at least substantially vertical relative to the layer system of the at least one photovoltaic cell, and wherein the segments of the at least one photovoltaic cell are electrically conductively connected in parallel with one another such that a flow of electric current through the at least one photovoltaic cell is distributed over the individual segments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the base electrode, the layer system and the top electrode are laser structured. In a preferred embodiment, the base electrode forms a cathode and the top electrode forms an anode.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the base electrode is arranged on a substrate, in particular a film.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A cavity is understood, in particular, as a space between at least two segments that separates the segments from one another at least in sections, such that there is at least no electrically conductive connection between the at least two segments via such a section and/or the segments do not contact one another in this section area. A cavity forms a specific distance between two segments one below the other horizontally to the layer system. The cavity is, in particular, an intermediate space.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, an embodiment the invention discloses a technical solution for preventing damage to photovoltaic elements, in particular organic photovoltaic elements, by what are known as hot spots. The implementation of this solution allows a photovoltaic element composed of multiple photovoltaic cells to continue to function without impairment even if one or more photovoltaic cells are shaded.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Segmentation is understood to mean, in particular, at least partial separation of the top electrode and the layer system, or the top electrode, the layer system and at least partly the base electrode of the photovoltaic cell, such that, in the event of at least partial shading and/or a defect in the at least one photovoltaic cell, an electric current in each individual segment obtained is large enough not to damage the photovoltaic cell. Depending on the desired limitation of the current density in the respective segments, the segments can be segmented depending on a cross-sectional area of the segments, in particular a width and a length of the segments, with a current density in individual segments being lower compared to a photovoltaic cell without segmentation. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the current flow decreases in the individual segments, in particular the current density is so low, in such a way that an at least partly shaded photovoltaic cell, in particular a fully shaded photovoltaic cell, remains able to conduct the flow of current of the non-shaded neighboring photovoltaic cells without damage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Shading is understood to mean, in particular, an at least partial reduction in the incidence of light on a photovoltaic element, with, in particular, an at least essentially opaque object casting its shadow from the sun onto components of a photovoltaic element. In a shaded or at least partly shaded cell, an opposite voltage is present in comparison with a non-shaded cell when light is irradiated, since no or a lower flow of current is generated in the at least partly shaded cell itself. As a result, an at least partly shaded cell connected in series with other non-shaded cells can be damaged.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A defect is understood to mean, in particular, a fault in a layer system of a photovoltaic cell or in the electrically conductive connection of the layer system comprising at least one electrode.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A photovoltaic element is understood to mean, in particular, a solar cell, with the photovoltaic element having at least one photovoltaic cell. The photovoltaic cells can be arranged and/or connected in the photovoltaic element in different ways. The photovoltaic element is preferably constructed from a plurality of photovoltaic cells, which are connected in series.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A possible structure of the layer system of a photovoltaic cell is described in WO2004083958A2, WO2011013219A1, WO2011138021A2, WO2011161108A1. In the applications specified here, use is preferably made of layer systems in which the photoactive layers comprise absorbent materials which are evaporable and which are or have been applied by physical vapor deposition (PVD). To this end, use is made of materials belonging to the group of &#x201c;small molecules&#x201d;, which are described, inter alia, in WO2006092134A1, WO2010133208A1, WO2014206860A1, WO2014128278A1, WO2017114937A1, and WO2017114938A1. The photoactive layers form acceptor/donor systems, and may be formed of a plurality of individual layers, or mixed layers, as a planar heterojunction and preferably as a bulk heterojunction. Layer systems that can be completely applied by way of physical vapor deposition are preferred.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The layer system can be in the form of a single cell, tandem cell or multicell, the designation being determined by the number of subcells, with each subcell containing at least one photoactive layer which are preferably separated by transport layers, and optional recombination layers, and which themselves may consist of a plurality of layers. The p-layer systems or n-layer systems, also referred to simply as p-layer or n-layer, may consist of a plurality of layers, with at least one of the layers of the p-layer system or n-layer system being p-doped or n-doped, preferably as a p-doped or n-doped wide gap layer. The i-layer system, also referred to as i-layer, is an undoped or less doped, that is to say has weaker doping, in relation to the p- and n-layers in the subcell, and is in the form of a photoactive layer. Each of these n-, p-, layers may consist of further layers, with the n- and p-layer consisting of at least one doped n- and p-layer, respectively, which as a result of its doping contributes to an increase in the charge carriers. This means that the layer stack of the photovoltaic cell consists of an expedient combination of p-, n-, and i-layer systems, that is to say each subcell comprises an i-layer system and at least one p- or n-layer system.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A horizontal extension of the layer system is understood to mean, in particular, a direction running essentially parallel to a substrate and/or to a layer of the layer system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a preferred embodiment, the photovoltaic element has a cell comprising at least one photoactive layer, in particular a CIS-, CIGS-, GaAs-, or Si-cell, a perovskite cell or an organic photovoltaic element (OPV), a so-called organic solar cell. An organic photovoltaic element is understood to mean in particular a photovoltaic element having at least one organic photoactive layer, in particular a polymer organic photovoltaic element or an organic photovoltaic element on the basis of small molecules. While polymers are distinguished by being not evaporable and therefore only being able to be applied from solutions, small molecules are usually evaporable and can either be applied like polymers as a solution, but also by means of vapor deposition technology, in particular by vapor deposition from a vacuum. The photovoltaic element is particularly preferably a flexible organic small-molecule-based photovoltaic element.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the photoactive layer of the layer system comprises small molecules which are evaporable in vacuo. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least the photoactive layer of the layer system is vapor deposited in vacuo.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Small molecules are understood to mean, in particular, non-polymeric organic molecules having monodisperse molar masses between 100 and 2000 g/mol that exist in the solid phase at standard pressure (air pressure of the ambient atmosphere) and at room temperature. In particular, the small molecules are photoactive, &#x201c;photoactive&#x201d; being understood to mean that the molecules undergo a change of charge state and/or of polarization state when light is supplied.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the top electrode comprises silver or a silver alloy, aluminum or an aluminum alloy, gold or a gold alloy, or a combination of these materials, preferably comprising as silver alloy Ag:Mg or Ag:Ca.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The photovoltaic element according to the invention has advantages over the prior art. Advantageously, protection of the photovoltaic element against hot spots is made possible; in particular, a current generated in non-shaded cells can be divided between the individual segments of an at least partly shaded cell, thereby preventing damage to the at least partly shaded cell. The photovoltaic element can thus continue to generate electricity using the other non-shaded cells. The at least one photovoltaic cell is advantageously not damaged in the event of at least partial shading and/or in the event of a defect in the photovoltaic cell. Advantageously, the efficiency is increased when individual photovoltaic cells of the photovoltaic element are shaded, and the service life of the photovoltaic element is increased. Advantageously, there is no or at least substantially no loss of area of the photovoltaic cell and/or there is no loss or at least substantially no loss in the performance of the photovoltaic cell. A flow of electric current from the preceding photovoltaic cell is advantageously distributed to the individual segments of the at least partly shaded photovoltaic cell. Advantageously, the segmentation can be integrated particularly easily into current production methods; in particular, only a small amount of effort is required for programming the laser structuring. Production can advantageously be integrated into a roll-to-roll process. The segmentation can be incorporated directly into the layer system during production without the use of additional external components, in particular diodes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Advantageously, the segmentation of photovoltaic cells is more cost-effective compared to other solutions, especially compared to bypass diodes. Advantageously, the electric current flowing through the individual segments is lower.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment of the invention, provision is made for the photovoltaic element to comprise at least a first photovoltaic cell and a second photovoltaic cell, wherein the at least first photovoltaic cell and second photovoltaic cell are connected in series, and wherein the top electrode of the first photovoltaic cell is electrically conductively connected to the base electrode of the second photovoltaic cell, wherein the base electrodes of the photovoltaic cells are preferably separated from one another in the horizontal direction, relative to the layer system, and the top electrodes of the photovoltaic cells are separated from one another in the horizontal direction, relative to the layer system.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an embodiment of the invention, provision is made for a cross-sectional area of the segments of the at least one photovoltaic cell, based on the horizontal extent of the layer system, to be the same as one another, wherein preferably a size of the cross-sectional area of the segments is the same depending on a flow of current through the at least one photovoltaic cell.
