Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a laser cleaning device for removing foreign matter from a metal surface, and more particularly to a manual laser cleaning device adapted to allow an operator to perform a laser cleaning operation with respect to a metal surface by gripping a laser cleaning head thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various kinds of foreign matter exist on a metal surface in industrial manufacturing fields. For efficient subsequent processes, it is necessary to remove foreign matter, such as oil, rust, and oxide films, on the metal surface. In particular, in the shipbuilding and automobile industry, paints, such as epoxy and urethane, are applied to surfaces of metal members for rust prevention and protection. Upon welding between the members, the paints present in a welding area adversely affect weld quality and thus must be removed. Further, when ships or automobiles are repaired after a certain period of time, repainting operation is performed again after complete removal of the previous paint.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, such foreign matter (including paints and coating agents) present on the metal surface are removed by bead blasting or grinding. However, since this method causes contamination of surrounding environments and provides detrimental effects on safety of operators, various attempts have been made to apply a laser cleaning method which is more environmentally friendly and safe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the laser cleaning method has been restrictively used in work sites or processes where installation and utilization of laser cleaning devices is easy, such as semiconductor production plants and the like, and it has been difficult to use the laser cleaning method at general industrial sites, such as shipbuilding and automobile industries under conditions where input and installation of the laser cleaning devices is restricted.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention suggests a manual laser cleaning device adapted to allow an operator to perform cleaning operation with respect to a metal surface, with a laser cleaning head of the manual laser cleaning device gripped by the operator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable that the manual laser cleaning device meet the following conditions in order to be efficiently used in general industrial fields, such as shipbuilding and automobiles.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">First, the laser cleaning head is required to have a light weight to be gripped by an operator in cleaning operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the manual laser cleaning device focuses a laser beam on a focal plane through a focal lens in cleaning operation and is thus required to maintain a constant focal length for stable cleaning operation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, when a laser beam is delivered to the surroundings of a workpiece instead of being delivered to the workpiece, there can be a significant risk to safety of operators and persons around the operators. Therefore, there is a need for a structure capable of preventing the laser beam from being delivered to the operators and persons around the operators.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a manual laser cleaning device that allows an operator to perform efficient and safe cleaning operation with respect to a surface of a workpiece by gripping a laser cleaning head thereof.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a manual laser cleaning device for removing foreign matter from a surface of a workpiece, the manual laser cleaning device including: a laser generator oscillating a laser beam; a controller controlling the laser generator; and a laser cleaning head receiving the laser beam emitted from the laser generator through an optical fiber and irradiating a surface of a workpiece (W) with the received laser beam, wherein the laser cleaning head includes: a head housing having a handle; a collimator placed in the head housing and collimating the laser beam scattered at one end of the optical fiber into parallel light; a high-speed Galvano scanner scanning the laser beam transmitted through the collimator at high speed using a mirror mounted on a scanning motor; and a focal lens focusing the laser beam scanned by the high-speed Galvano scanner at a focal distance (d) and irradiating the surface of the workpiece with the laser beam.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, the laser cleaning head may include a metal detection sensor detecting whether the surface of the workpiece is a metal surface and the controller may block oscillation of the laser beam by the laser generator upon detecting that the surface of the workpiece is not the metal surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, the laser cleaning head may further include a laser beam guide bar coupled to the head housing to guide the laser beam focused at the focal distance by the focal lens.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one embodiment, the laser beam guide bar may be adjustable in length according to the focal lens.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one embodiment, the laser beam guide bar may be provided on a side surface thereof with a dust collection port connected to a dust connection hose connected to a dust collector.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment, the laser cleaning head may further include a bearing wheel coupled to the laser beam guide bar and rolling along the surface of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment, the head housing may be formed of a plastic material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one embodiment, the high-speed Galvano scanner may be operated in a 2D scanning manner using two scanning motors and two mirrors.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one embodiment, the laser generator and the controller may be integrated into one portable laser cleaning module capable of being carried by an operator through a handle or a shoulder strap, the portable laser cleaning module being connected to a power supply unit through a power cable therebetween.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one embodiment, the laser cleaning head may further include a protective window disposed in a region behind the focal lens to protect the focal lens and optical components placed in front of the focal lens, and the focal lens may be an f-&#x3b8; lens.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one embodiment, the laser generator and the controller may be mounted together with the power supply unit on a movable cart.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The manual laser cleaning device according to the present invention allows an operator to perform cleaning operation with respect to a surface of a workpiece by gripping the laser cleaning head, thereby enabling easy cleaning of the surface of the workpiece under various operation conditions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the manual laser cleaning device according to the present invention, since the laser cleaning head is lightweight, the laser cleaning head gripped by the operator can be easily handled.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The manual laser cleaning device according to the present invention focuses a laser beam on a focal plane through a focal lens.

For more effective laser cleaning, a 2D high-speed Galvano scanner <b>230</b> adapted to perform 2D scanning using two scanning motors and two mirrors is advantageous.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The laser beam subjected to 1D or 2D scanning is focused at a certain focal distance d through the focal lens <b>240</b>. Preferably, the focal lens <b>240</b> is an f-&#x3b8; lens. Advantageously, the f-theta maintains a focus in a scanning region, thereby enabling uniform cleaning.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to protect the focal lens <b>240</b> and the mirrors inside the high-speed Galvano scanner <b>230</b>, a protective window <b>250</b> is preferably disposed ahead of the focal lens <b>240</b>, that is, in front of the focal lens <b>240</b> when viewed in a traveling direction of the laser beam. According to this embodiment, the protective window <b>250</b> may be disposed near a lower end of the second head housing part <b>214</b>. Here, it is desirable that the protective window <b>250</b> be a consumable component. It is desirable for an operator to perform periodic cleaning with respect to a surface of the protective window <b>250</b>, which is consumable, before laser cleaning.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, to maintain a constant focal location of the focal lens <b>240</b>, the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> includes a laser beam guide bar <b>260</b> disposed to guide the laser beam beneath the focal lens <b>240</b>. The guide bar <b>260</b> is configured to allow adjustment in total height thereof and includes a stationary part <b>262</b> and a movable part <b>264</b> movably coupled to the stationary part <b>262</b> to be moved up or down. Upon laser cleaning with respect to the metal surface of the workpiece W, the guide bar <b>260</b> is disposed such that a proximal end of the guide bar <b>260</b> is coincident with a focus location of the laser beam. When the focal lens is replaced for the purpose of adjusting the intensity of the laser beam per area, the focal distance d is changed. Thus, the guide bar <b>260</b> preferably has an adjustable length.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The laser cleaning head <b>200</b> further includes a bearing wheel <b>266</b> rotatably coupled to a distal end of the guide bar <b>260</b>, more specifically, to a distal end of the movable part <b>264</b> of the guide bar <b>260</b>. When manual scanning is performed, the bearing wheel <b>266</b> rolls along the metal surface of the workpiece W to facilitate movement of the laser cleaning head <b>200</b>, thereby guaranteeing uniform cleaning operation with respect to the overall metal surface.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> further includes a metal detection sensor <b>270</b> disposed near the distal end of the guide bar <b>260</b>. The metal detection sensor <b>270</b> detects whether the workpiece W is a metal. Preferably, the metal detection sensor <b>270</b> is an inductive sensor. The inductive sensor generates a magnetic field in an internal coil to generate an induced current in a metallic material adjacent thereto by the magnetic field, so that impedance of the coil is changed by the induced current. The inductive sensor recognizes such change in impedance as a metal detection signal. In principle, since distinction between metals and non-metals is clear, the inductive sensor has an advantage of accurately recognizing objects, such as general air, insulators, and people, which are not metals.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the metal detection sensor <b>270</b> detects the surface of the workpiece as a metal surface, the controller <b>120</b> controls the laser generator <b>130</b> to oscillate a laser beam. In addition, when the metal detection sensor <b>270</b> does not detect the surface of the workpiece as a metal surface, the controller <b>120</b> guarantees safety of operators and the surroundings of the operators by fundamentally blocking oscillation of the laser beam from the laser generator <b>130</b>. The height of the metal detection sensor <b>270</b> is set to be separated a distance of 1 cm to 5 cm from the surface of the workpiece in order to secure sufficient sensitivity while preventing contamination.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the laser cleaning operation, a large amount of dust is generated on the surface of the workpiece. In particular, in the case of paint cleaning, a large amount of toxic dust is generated. When such dust is effectively collected, safety of an operator can be guaranteed while preventing contamination of optical components in the laser cleaning head <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A side surface of the guide bar <b>260</b>, particularly a side surface of the movable part <b>264</b> is provided with a dust collection port <b>265</b>, which is connected to a dust connection hose <b>420</b> connected to a dust collector <b>400</b>. The dust collector <b>400</b> collects dust, which is generated in the course of laser cleaning, through the duct collection hose <b>420</b> connected to the dust collection port <b>265</b>. In order to secure sufficient dust collection, it is important for the dust collection port <b>265</b> to have a sufficient diameter. Preferably, the dust collection port <b>265</b> has a diameter of 5 cm or more.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An operator holds the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> by hand in order to perform the cleaning operation. Thus, in order to allow easy handling of the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> by the operator, the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> has a light weight. To this end, the head housings <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> are preferably formed of a plastic material. Preferably, the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> has a total weight of 3 kg or less to secure workability of operators.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the first part <b>212</b> of the head housings <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, that is, a portion near the handle, is provided with an ON/OFF switch <b>217</b>. The ON/OFF switch is preferably a button or a trigger.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the focal lens <b>240</b> mounted on the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> preferably has a focal length of 150 mm to 600 mm. When the focal lens has too close a focal length of less than 150 mm, optical components in the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> can be easily contaminated due to dust generated during the cleaning operation, and when the focal lens has too long a focal length of greater than 150 mm, the laser beam can have too large a spot size to provide sufficient laser intensity, thereby making it difficult to perform an effective laser cleaning operation.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When laser cleaning technology is applied to industrial manufacturing sites, mobility of the laser cleaning device is a very important issue. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the main body <b>100</b> including the laser generator <b>130</b>, the controller <b>120</b> and the power supply unit <b>110</b> may be loaded on the movable cart <b>10</b> or each of the laser generator <b>130</b>, the controller <b>120</b> and the power supply unit <b>110</b> may be loaded thereon, thereby enabling easy movement of the manual laser cleaning device by moving the movable cart <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At ship manufacturing sites, laser cleaning is frequently performed inside a ship. In this case, since it is not easy to move the main body <b>100</b> including the laser generator <b>130</b>, the controller <b>120</b> and the power supply unit <b>110</b> to the movable cart including wheels, there is a need for an operator to enter a work site with the main body <b>100</b> of the laser cleaning device carried by hand or on the shoulder.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram of a manual laser cleaning device according to another embodiment of the invention, which includes a portable laser cleaning module including a laser generator and a controller and adapted to allow an operator to carry the portable laser cleaning module by hand or on the shoulder when entering a work site.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the manual laser cleaning device according to this embodiment is provided therein with a laser generator <b>130</b> and a controller <b>120</b> and includes a portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> adapted to allow an operator to carry the portable laser cleaning module on the shoulder or by hand. In order to allow the operator to carry the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> on the shoulder, the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> is provided with a shoulder strap <b>5</b>. In addition, in order to allow the operator to carry the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> by hand, the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> is provided at an upper end thereof with a handle <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The manual laser cleaning device according to this embodiment further includes a power supply unit <b>110</b> mounted on the movable cart <b>10</b>. Since the power supply unit <b>110</b> is heavy, it is desirable that the power supply unit <b>110</b> be mounted on the movable cart <b>10</b> instead of being received inside the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b>. A power cable <b>400</b> having a sufficient length is disposed between the power supply unit <b>110</b> and the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> mounted on the movable cart <b>10</b> and the power supply unit <b>110</b> supplies power to the portable laser cleaning module <b>101</b> through the power cable <b>400</b>. In recent years, due to remarkable improvement in battery performance, the power supply unit <b>110</b> may employ a battery <b>112</b>. The power cable <b>400</b> may be adjusted in length according to an operation environment and may have a length of <b>10</b> m or more for efficient operation.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As in the above embodiment, the manual laser cleaning device according to this embodiment includes a laser cleaning head <b>200</b> that receives a laser beam transmitted from the laser generator <b>110</b> through an optical fiber <b>300</b> and irradiates a metal surface of a workpiece with the received laser beam. The laser cleaning head <b>200</b> has substantially the same configuration as that of the above embodiment and detailed description thereof will be omitted to avoid repeated description.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When an operator performs a laser cleaning operation using the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> for a long period of time in a state of holding the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> by hand, the operator can suffer significant fatigue. In order to reduce such fatigue, the manual laser cleaning device according to this embodiment further includes a neck strap <b>2</b> connected to the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> to hang the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> on the neck of the operator. When the operator performs the laser cleaning operation with the neck strap <b>2</b> hung on the neck of the operator and connected to the laser cleaning head <b>200</b>, the weight of the laser cleaning head <b>200</b> can be distributed to allow the operator to perform the laser cleaning operation under more convenient conditions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As a result, when the laser cleaning operation is manually carried out, the manual laser cleaning device according to the present invention can maintain a constant focal location to allow stable cleaning operation and can fundamentally block delivery of a laser beam to a location outside a metal workpiece while effectively collecting detrimental dust, thereby enabling safe cleaning operation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It should be understood that the present invention can be applied to any manufacturing sites using a laser cleaning process.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although some embodiments have been described herein, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that these embodiments are given by way of illustration only and the present invention is not limited thereto and that various modifications, variations, and alterations can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
