Particularly, the present disclosed subject matter is directed to a medical device for use within the aorta.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aortic aneurysms are a common deteriorating disease typically manifested by a weakening and expansion of the aorta vessel wall. Aneurysms affect the ability of the vessel lumen to conduct fluids, and may at times be life threatening when, for example, rupture of the vessel wall occurs. A standard treatment for repairing an aneurysm is to surgically remove part or all of the aneurysm and implant a replacement prosthetic section into the vessel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The aorta is the major artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of the aorta <b>100</b> and the heart <b>108</b>. The aorta <b>100</b> includes an ascending aorta <b>102</b>, an aortic arch <b>104</b>, and a descending aorta <b>106</b>. The ascending aorta <b>102</b> is the first segment of the aorta <b>100</b> where the aorta <b>100</b> originates from the heart's left ventricle. Coronary arteries <b>110</b> originate at the aortic root <b>111</b>. The brachiocephalic artery <b>116</b>, the left common carotid artery <b>118</b>, and the left subclavian artery <b>120</b> branch from the aortic arch <b>104</b>. The descending artery <b>106</b> extends past the diaphragm <b>112</b>, leading to the abdominal aorta <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aortic dissection occurs when the inner layer of the aorta's artery wall splits open (dissects). This is more likely to occur where pressure on the arterial wall from blood flow is high, such as in the ascending aorta <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a dissection <b>122</b> in the ascending aorta <b>102</b>. The dissection may be caused by a tear <b>124</b> in the aortic wall. When the layers of the aortic wall split open (separate from one another), it creates a false lumen <b>126</b> through which pulsatile blood flow can access the inner layers that compose the arterial wall.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The flow of blood through this false lumen, and the resulting increase in pressure, can exacerbate the dissection and cause further tearing. The standard surgical approach in patients with ascending aortic aneurysm or dissection involving the aortic root and associated with aortic valve disease is open heart surgery including the replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta. Acute type A dissection is categorized as a surgical emergency with a 1% mortality per hour, and an average operative mortality of 30%. In patients who have multiple comorbidities, hemodynamic instability or malperfusion and end-organ dysfunction, aortic root replacement for the above indications carry significant operative mortalities and morbidities.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Numerous endovascular devices are known to treat varying aspects of heart valves and aortic root repair, including U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2009/0270965, 2009/0264993, 2012/0130472, 2006/0195177 and U.S. Pat.

Additionally or alternatively, a longitudinal bar with radio-opaque markers, to be deployed along the greater curvature of the ascending aorta, can be incorporated into the endovascular graft(s) to better approximate the native aortic anatomy and orientation. In the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, the stent graft portion has four radio-opaque markers <b>1000</b> positioned 90 degrees apart at the proximal and distal ends. This allows for accurate placement with respect to the distal or proximal positioning of the stent graft, as well as for accurate circumferential positioning of the stent graft ends in the event the physician needs to rotate the stent graft with respect to one of the other components (e.g. valve member <b>200</b>, brachiocephalic stent graft <b>400</b>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the disclosed example, the stent is shown in a Z-shaped configuration, although other configurations (e.g. a series of annular rings with longitudinally extending connectors, or a criss-crossing configuration) may also be employed.

Also, the stent graft portion(s) of the device, whether in an integral construction or multi-part configuration, can be formed within a range of lengths and diameters to be deployed and accommodate to the widest range of human anatomy. Additionally, each endovascular graft can be fully adjustable, fully repositionable, and fully retrievable during the delivery and deployment procedure (described in further detail below) such that it can return to its original fully expanded form after external compression without impact on structural integrity, radial and longitudinal strength and flow characteristics.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments the endovascular graft <b>300</b> can include retention features (e.g. outwardly extending barbs) pointing in the distal direction to improve anchorage of the stent graft component <b>300</b> to the valve member <b>200</b>.

Moreover, the larger cross-sectional area of the stent <b>500</b> reduces the chance of tissue by distributing the contact force between the multiple rings which make up the anchoring stent <b>500</b> and the tissue over a larger contact area. This larger area is advantageous as compared to prior art anchoring devices (e.g. hooks and barbs) as the increased surface area of stent <b>500</b> reduces the localized peak force on the tissue and reduces the likelihood that damage will occur.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When properly positioned, the anchoring stent <b>500</b> is then deployed proximally from within the side-branched tunnel <b>402</b> of brachiocephalic stent graft <b>400</b> distally to within the brachiocephalic artery, but proximal to the bifurcation into right subclavian and right common carotid artery.

This exemplary aortic arch component <b>600</b> can be deployed with the various components discussed above (e.g., valve member <b>200</b>, endovascular graft <b>300</b>) with the aggregate device being formed as an integral unit, or plurality of discrete components for assembly.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">These radiopaque markers allow precise placement of the aortic arch component <b>600</b>, and in particular allows the opening <b>602</b> within the graft material to be precisely placed in a corresponding position, or adjacent, to the brachiocephalic artery (<b>3</b>), the left common carotid artery (<b>4</b>), and the left subclavian artery (<b>5</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The opening <b>602</b> is sized to extend across each of these arteries such that there is no graft material present to inhibit or occlude blood flow between these arteries and the inner lumen of the device <b>600</b>. Instead only the bare metal struts of the expandable frame are present across these arteries. Additionally, in some embodiments the underlying (or interwoven) expandable frame of the aortic arch component <b>600</b> can be formed with an &#x201c;open cell&#x201d; design in which the struts or annular rings which form the lattice of the aortic arch component are absent across this opening <b>602</b>. The absence of any struts and graft material reduce the likelihood of obstruction or interference with blood flow through the aortic graft component <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The aortic arch graft <b>600</b> can also include anchor members (e.g. self-expanding stents or grafts) partially extending into the proximal and distal ends thereof. As discussed above, the aortic arch graft <b>600</b> can also include interference fit connections and/or structural retention features which connect the adjacent components together. For example, the aortic arch graft <b>600</b> for deployment in the thoracic aorta can be coupled with the proximal anchorage into another expandable stent/graft, whereby the proximal end of the anchoring stent/graft is located at or just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery (<b>5</b>). In some embodiments, the overlapping region <b>680</b> between the adjacent components is a distance of about 2.0 cm or greater.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The proximal and distal ends of the aortic arch graft <b>600</b> (and any anchoring members present) can also include radiopaque markers as described above to facilitate positioning (i.e. longitudinal as well as circumferential) of the components.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">While the disclosed subject matter is described herein in terms of certain preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications and improvements may be made to the disclosed subject matter without departing from the scope thereof.
