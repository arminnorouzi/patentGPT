In some examples, the device includes a static mixer for mechanically mixing one or more fluids, such as one or more formulations. The fluids are introduced into a static mixing cavity, mechanically mixed by the static mixing cavity, and then dispensed from an outlet as a mixed fluid.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the one or more formulations are cosmetic formulations, and may include but are not limited to various products for hair (e.g., coloration, cleansing, treatment, etc.), for skin (e.g., cleansing, anti-acne, makeup removal, etc.), for color cosmetics (e.g., foundations, liners, concealers, tints, etc.), etc. While the following examples describes the formulations as cosmetic formulations, it will be appreciated that the material to be mixed is not limited to the cosmetic field. Thus, static mixers of the present disclosure can be employed in any field of use where a mixing of fluids is desirable.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As will be described in more detail below, examples of the static mixer are configured to be reusable. In some embodiments, the static mixer is formed by two housing halves that are detachably coupled to one another via press fit structure, snap fit structure, or other suitable means, etc. In some embodiments, the two housing halves of the static mixer are hingedly connected so that the static mixer can be easily opened for cleaning the static mixing cavity. In some embodiments, the static mixer is formed by a single plastic (e.g., polypropylene, etc.) part with a living-hinge interconnecting the two housing halves.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be further described in more detail below, the static mixing cavity is configured to promote mixing of the one or more fluids as the fluid(s) traverse through the static mixer. For example, in some embodiments, the inside walls of the housing halves defining the static mixing cavity contain mixing features (e.g., ribs, baffles, etc.) that are intended to create turbulence and cumulative mixing forces. In some embodiments, the ribs, baffles, etc., are cooperatively configured on both housing halves to create a turbulent mixing path from fluid entrance into the static mixing cavity to fluid exit out of the static mixing cavity. In some embodiments, one or more of the ribs and/or baffles include holes positioned to maximize turbulence and mixing over the distance of formulation travel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown perspective and top views, respectively, of a representative example of a static mixer, generally designated <b>20</b>, formed in accordance with principles of the present disclosure.

In use, fluid stored in the first fluid cartridge <b>24</b>A and/or second fluid cartridge <b>24</b>B are introduced into the static mixer <b>20</b>. As the fluid(s) from the first and/or second fluid cartridge traverse through the static mixer <b>20</b>, the fluid(s) encounter mixing components (not shown) that introduce turbulence and cumulative mixing forces on the fluid(s). The fluid(s) from the first and/or second cartridge <b>24</b> exit the static mixer <b>20</b> from outlet port <b>28</b> as a single, mixed fluid, such as a mixed cosmetic formulation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are longitudinal cross-sectional views of views of the static mixer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, taken along lines <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>4</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the static mixer <b>20</b> includes a housing that defines a static mixing cavity <b>32</b>.

The first and second fluid connector ports <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B are connected in fluid communication with the static mixing cavity <b>32</b>, which in turn, is connected in fluid communication with the outlet port <b>28</b>. The outlet port <b>28</b> is arranged at the end of the housing <b>30</b> opposite the connector ports <b>34</b> for dispensing fluid introduced to the static mixing cavity <b>32</b> in a mixed manner. The first and second connector ports <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B are also adapted to be coupled in fluid communication with the first and second fluid cartridges <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each fluid cartridge <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B includes a housing <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B that defines a fluid reservoir <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B for storing a fluid to be mixed by the static mixer <b>20</b>. Each fluid cartridge <b>24</b> is configured to be coupled to the static mixer <b>20</b>. In the embodiment shown, the first and second cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B, storing fluids FA, FB, are mounted on the top of the static mixer <b>20</b> in a side-by-side configuration. The fluid cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B include fluid fitting <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, respectively, configured and arranged to be coupled to respective connector ports <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B. Once coupled, the fluid fittings <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are configured to cooperate with the connector ports <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B to transfer the fluid from the fluid cartridges to the static mixing cavity <b>32</b> in a fluidically sealed manner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the housing <b>36</b> of the fluid cartridges <b>24</b> are constructed of flexible plastic, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, synthetic rubber, such as silicon rubber, etc. In these embodiments, the fluid cartridges can, for example, be pressed or squeezed by a user's hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in order to increase the internal pressure within the fluid reservoir <b>38</b> to expel the fluid FA, FB from the cartridges <b>24</b> and into the static mixer <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid fittings <b>40</b> are configured to be detachably coupled to the static mixer <b>20</b> so that the static mixer <b>20</b> can be reused with different cartridges, combinations of cartridges, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, the static mixer <b>20</b> is configured to be cleaned in a simple manner to aid in reusing the static mixer with a variety of different products. In that regard, the housing of the static mixer <b>20</b> in some embodiments may be formed by two housing halves (shown as <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>) that are detachably coupled to one another via press fit structure, snap fit structure, etc. In some embodiments, the two housing halves of the static mixer <b>20</b> are also hingedly connected so that the static mixer <b>20</b> can be easily opened in a pivoting movement for cleaning the static mixing cavity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the static mixer <b>20</b> is formed by a single plastic (e.g., polypropylene, etc.) part with a living-hinge <b>44</b> that interconnects the first and second housing halves <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B. The living hinge <b>44</b> may be formed at the outlet port end of the housing <b>22</b>. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the living hinge is formed at the connector port end of the housing <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the fluid in each fluid cartridge <b>24</b> is a single fluid (e.g., yellow ink) intended to be mixed with another fluid (e.g., red ink) in the static mixing cavity <b>32</b> and dispensed from the outlet port <b>28</b> as a single mixture (e.g., orange ink). In some embodiments, the fluid in one or both fluid cartridges can be a homogenous fluid or formulation or a heterogenous fluid or formulation. In some embodiments, the static mixer <b>20</b> can statically mix a heterogenous formulation introduced from only one of the fluid cartridges.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the fluid stored in the fluid cartridges can be a liquid, a paste, a gel, a cream, a sol, an emulsion, etc. In some embodiments, the fluids are cosmetic formulations, and may include but are not limited to various products for hair (e.g., coloration, cleansing, treatment, etc.), for skin (e.g., cleansing, anti-acne, makeup removal, etc.), for color cosmetics (e.g., foundations, liners, concealers, tints, etc.), etc.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the static mixer <b>20</b> also includes mixing components <b>50</b> that introduce, for example, turbulence and cumulative mixing forces to the fluid in the static mixing cavity <b>32</b>. In some embodiments, the mixing components <b>50</b> include a plurality of baffles, ribs, etc., or other mixing structure associated with the static mixing cavity <b>32</b> that promote, for example, continuous mixing or blending of the one or more fluids as the one or more fluids traverse through the static mixer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, in some embodiments, the inside walls of the housing halves <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, which define the static mixing cavity <b>32</b>, are formed with baffles, ribs, etc., that aim to create turbulence and cumulative mixing forces. In some embodiments, the ribs extend inwardly from the housing's inner walls and are cooperatively configured on both housing halves <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B to create a mechanical mixing path <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the path <b>54</b> may be somewhat serpentine in shape as the cavity <b>32</b> tapers to a smaller cross-section near the outlet <b>28</b> of the static mixer <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the ribs or baffles includes holes <b>58</b> positioned to maximize turbulence and mixing of the fluid as the fluids pass along the mixing path <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a one-way valve or check valve can be used in order to permit fluid to flow into the static mixer from the fluid cartridges but to prohibit fluid from flowing out of the static mixer and back into the fluid cartridges. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each fluid cartridge may include a check valve <b>64</b> associated with the fluid fitting <b>40</b>. In the embodiment shown, the check valve <b>64</b> is of the duckbill valve type. In some embodiments, the check valve <b>64</b> can include but is not limited to one or more valves selected from the group consisting of a duckbill valve, a reed valve, a ball check valve, a diagram check valve, and a gate check valve. Additionally or alternatively, each of the connector ports <b>34</b> may include or is associated with a check valve <b>64</b>. In any case, use of check valves can minimize or remove any cross contamination between the formulas during and/or after mixing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">One example of the method for using the static mixer <b>20</b> to mix one or more fluids will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b></figref>. Firstly, one or more fluids, such as FA, FB, to be mixed are selected, and their respective cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are coupled to the static mixer <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. In that regard, each cartridge <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B is coupled to the static mixer <b>20</b> such that the connector fittings <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B are disposed in fluid communication with the connector ports <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B. In the embodiment shown, the cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are positioned in a side by side configuration.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, pressure is applied to the cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B, for example, by pressing the cartridges laterally inwardly from diametrically opposite sides with a user's fingers and/or thumb, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Pressing the sides of the flexible cartridge causes an increase in the internal pressure within the fluid reservoirs of the cartridges, and forces the fluids FA, FB into the static mixing cavity <b>32</b> through the connector fittings/connector ports. Continued increasing pressure forces the fluids FA, FB through the static mixer <b>20</b> and out of the outlet <b>28</b>. As the fluids FA, FB are forced through the static mixing cavity, the fluids traverse a mechanical mixing path <b>54</b> causing continuous mixing or blending of the fluids. The mixed or blended fluids are then expelled from the static mixer through the outlet <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">To clean the static mixer <b>20</b>, the cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are decoupled from the static mixer <b>20</b>. Next, one housing half <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B is separated from the other housing half <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B. In some embodiments, the one housing half <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B is separated from the other housing half <b>22</b>A or <b>22</b>B by pivoting movement about a hinge, such as living hinge <b>44</b>. Once separated, the internal structure (e.g., baffles, ribs, internal walls, etc.) of the housing halves <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B can be cleaned. The housing halves <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B are then coupled together for subsequent use with cartridges containing the same or different fluids.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the fluids contained in the fluid cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B have a similar viscosity. Similar viscosity of the fluids aid in an effective, balanced mixing. To further support a balanced ratio of the fluids in the mixed fluid, the device <b>20</b> in some embodiments may further include a force balancing mechanism. For example, in the embodiment shown, the force balancing mechanism includes a stiff, paddle-like structure <b>70</b> that extends outwardly from the connector port end of the housing <b>22</b>. The paddle-like structure <b>70</b> is positioned between the connector ports <b>34</b>A. <b>34</b>B and extends in the direction opposite the static mixing cavity <b>32</b>. When assembled, the cartridges <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B are disposed on either side of the paddle-like structure <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment shown, the paddle-like structure <b>70</b> defines opposite, flat surfaces. The paddle-like structure <b>70</b> can be constructed from the same material as the housing <b>22</b>, and in some embodiments, the paddle-like structure can be integrally formed with the housing. In these embodiments, the paddle-like structure <b>70</b> is cantilevered from the housing so that the paddle-like structure <b>70</b> flexes laterally, as needed, to promote equal forces in the cartridges as they are pressed inwardly from diametrically opposite sides by the user's fingers and/or thumb, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The detailed description set forth above in connection with the appended drawings, where like numerals reference like elements, are intended as a description of various embodiments of the present disclosure and are not intended to represent the only embodiments.
