In addition to the temperatures already measured and monitored at many points on vehicles to date, measuring and monitoring the temperature of the battery provided for supplying power to the drive motor is of great importance in the rapidly growing field of electromobility in particular. In the text which follows, the terms battery and accumulator as well as the terms or expressions comprising these terms will be used synonymously, provided that a respectively particular meaning is not apparent from the context.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The battery provided for supplying power to the drive motor firstly has to store a large amount of energy in order to allow a large range and secondly it has to be able to output high powers in order to meet the power requirement of the motor. In addition, said battery has to be able to be charged with a sufficiently high power in order to allow prompt re-use after discharging.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During discharging and during charging, correspondingly high currents occur, which can lead to a not inconsiderable increase in temperature at the unavoidable inner resistors or during the chemical reaction on which the charging and discharging are based. This increase in temperature can firstly have a strong influence on the charging or discharging characteristics and also the service life of the battery and secondly an excessively sharp rise in temperature can lead to damage to the battery or to components that are thermally coupled to it, resulting in protection devices being tripped or even an uncontrolled exothermic reaction which ultimately renders the use of the battery, and possibly a device supplied by it, impossible.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For this reason, temperature sensors are generally provided in high-power batteries, the temperature sensors detecting an increase in the temperature and passing on this information to a control device. When a limit value is exceeded, the control device reduces the discharging or charging power, before damage to the battery or to components or devices connected to it occurs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">High-power batteries usually comprise a large number of battery cells, which are interconnected in series and/or in parallel, in order to be able to provide a required rated voltage and a required rated current. The battery cells are generally arranged in a housing which provides protection against mechanical damage and can also accommodate sensors and associated electronic circuits. In addition, the housing can be designed to heat and/or to cool the battery in order to set an optimum temperature for charging or discharging the battery. In the text which follows, the housing is also referred to as a battery pack.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Battery cells can be provided, inter alia, in the form of round cells with a rigid cylindrical housing, prismatic cells with a cuboidal rigid housing or what are known as pouch cells, that is to say flat cells without a rigid housing. Cells with their own rigid housing offer advantages in respect of handling when designing and producing battery packs. In addition, the mechanical demands placed on the housing are lower than in the case of pouch cells. Furthermore, a large variety of cells with their own rigid housing are available from a large number of manufacturers, and therefore even relatively small batches of battery packs can be produced in a cost-effective manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Particularly when a large number of battery cells are arranged in one housing, the positioning of temperature sensors presents a challenge since good thermal contact between a temperature sensor and the battery cell is of considerable importance for proper functioning.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">DE 603 05 221 T2, which is incorporated by reference herein, proposes arranging temperature sensors in a holding structure for a plurality of round cells such that good thermal contact with the respective temperature sensors is provided given proper fitting of the round cells in the holding structure. When standard battery cells with a rigid housing are used, an insulating sheath surrounding the cell may have an adverse effect on the thermal contact between the temperature sensor fitted in the holding structure and the battery cell. Furthermore, replacement of individual temperature sensors, for example in the event of a failure, may be complicated; the entire holding structure may possibly have to be replaced.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Described herein is an arrangement for temperature measurement on a solid body, in particular a battery cell, which arrangement allows simple fitting of the temperature sensor on the solid body and provides good thermal contact between the temperature sensor and the solid body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An arrangement according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement on a solid body, in particular a battery cell, comprises an annularly closed elastic band, along the circumference of which or in the interior of which at least two temperature sensors are arranged at a distance from one another. The elastic band can be placed around the solid body, wherein the circumference of the elastic band is smaller than the circumference of the solid body, so that the elastic band bears against the solid body under elastic stress. As a result, the at least two temperature sensors are also at least indirectly placed against the solid body. In this case, the circumference of the elastic band can be designed for a circumferential region in which firstly sufficient elastic stress to securely hold the arrangement in place is ensured and secondly the tear threshold of the elastic band is not exceeded during assembly. The use of at least two temperature sensors can ensure a redundancy which is advantageous in principle for critical components.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the context of this description, the expression &#x201c;annularly closed band&#x201d; refers to a band which does not have two free ends to be connected to one another. The general shape of the band, that is to say whether it has an oval shape, a circular shape or a shape with one or more corners, is irrelevant here.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the context of this description, the term &#x201c;solid body&#x201d; refers to a body with a rigid outer surface. In this case, the solid body does not have to consist of the same material in solid form but rather can be entirely or partially hollow, and other elements, components, materials etc. can be arranged in any hollow space. In particular, the term &#x201c;solid body&#x201d; refers to a battery cell with a rigid housing.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The temperature sensors can comprise thermocouples, PT100 or PT1000 measuring sensors, can be semiconductor-based or can be based on other measurement principles.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one or more refinements of the arrangement, the annularly closed elastic band consists of an electrically non-conductive, thermally conductive and/or heat-resistant material, for example a silicone or silicone-based material, or the like. The use of an electrically non-conductive material has the readily identifiable advantage that no electric current is conducted by the elastic band to other locations when an electrical line or connection of battery cells is damaged. The advantage of the use of a thermally conductive material is that the accuracy of the positioning of the temperature sensor on or in the elastic band and also on the solid body is less critical. The advantage of the use of a heat-resistant material, in particular with a melting point or flame point far above the temperatures reached during normal operation, is obvious.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one or more refinements of the arrangement, a surface of each of the at least two temperature sensors terminates substantially flush with an internal surface of the annularly closed elastic band or is at least positioned closer to the internal surface of the annularly closed elastic band than to an external surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one or more refinements of the arrangement, the elastic band has a first elastic layer, and a second layer is arranged at least on a side of the first elastic layer that faces the solid body in the assembled state. The second layer has a greater thermal conductivity than the first elastic layer. A surface of each of the at least two temperature sensors is in thermal contact with the second layer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one or more refinements of the arrangement, electrical lines of the at least two temperature sensors are routed to an outer side of the annularly closed elastic band and are routed out or are electrically contactable there.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one or more refinements of the arrangement, the at least two temperature sensors are arranged in a manner distributed uniformly along the circumference of the annularly closed elastic band. This arrangement of the temperature sensors can allow, in particular on solid bodies with a symmetrical, preferably rotationally symmetrical, cross section, in addition to a certain redundancy, better estimation of the temperature in a region of the solid body between the temperature sensors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The solid body can comprise, for example, a battery cell, and the arrangement is arranged, for temperature measurement, on the outer surface of the battery cell, for example in a groove or recess which runs around the battery cell. In this case, the arrangement for temperature measurement preferably bears against the outer surface of the battery cell under elastic stress.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more refinements of the solid body, the solid body, for example the battery cell, is surrounded by an electrically non-conductive sheath, for example a shrink sleeve. The electrically non-conductive sheath presses the arrangement for temperature measurement against the battery cell. During production of the solid body, the arrangement for temperature measurement is initially arranged on the solid body, and thereafter the electrically non-conductive sheath is fitted over the solid body and the arrangement for temperature measurement.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A plurality of solid bodies can be arranged together, for example a plurality of battery cells can be arranged in a battery or a battery pack. In this case, at least one of the solid bodies is provided with an arrangement according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one or more refinements of the solid bodies which are arranged together, in particular in the case of battery cells which are arranged to form a battery or a battery or battery pack, solid bodies with an arrangement for temperature measurement and solid bodies without such an arrangement for temperature measurement are arranged with respect to one another such that a solid body equipped with the arrangement makes contact with an adjacent solid body without such an arrangement, preferably in the region of one of the temperature sensors. In this way, the temperature of two adjacent solid bodies can be detected using a single temperature sensor, as a result of which the number of temperature sensors can be reduced. It is possible to differentiate between the temperature of the adjacent solid bodies when a solid body without an arrangement for temperature measurement is in contact with solid bodies provided with an arrangement for temperature measurement at two points. For example, a single battery cell which has a higher temperature than the adjacent battery cells can be determined in this way.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention will be described below with reference to the figures of the drawing.

The sheathing <b>206</b> can consist, for example, of a material which contracts when heat is supplied and in this way bears against the contours of the battery housing.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the battery cell <b>200</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in the completely assembled state. The components in this illustration is clearly identifiable that the sheathing <b>206</b>, besides the battery housing <b>202</b>, also encompasses the arrangement <b>100</b> according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement and securely holds it in the groove <b>204</b>, so that a change in position of the arrangement <b>100</b> for temperature measurement can be virtually precluded. Only the lines <b>106</b> exit from the sheathing <b>206</b>, so that they can be easily contacted.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a view of a detail of a section through the battery cell <b>200</b> with the arrangement <b>100</b> according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement arranged on it. This view clearly shows the position of the arrangement <b>100</b> in the groove <b>204</b>, as well as the position of the temperature sensors <b>104</b>. Said FIG. likewise shows how the sheathing <b>206</b> encompasses the battery housing <b>202</b> and the arrangement <b>100</b> for temperature measurement. The further elements of the battery cell <b>200</b> are of a conventional nature and therefore will not be explained in any detail at this juncture.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a plan view of the battery cell <b>200</b> with the arrangement <b>100</b> according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement arranged on it. This view readily shows that only the lines <b>206</b> protrude beyond the dimensions of the battery cell <b>200</b>. Since the lines <b>106</b> are preferably flexible, and also can be embodied to be particularly thin, for example in the form of flat conductors arranged on or in a flexible substrate, they do not cause any major problems during assembly of a plurality of battery cells <b>200</b> to form a battery pack.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a plan view of an exemplary battery pack <b>300</b> with a plurality of battery cells <b>200</b>, at least some of which have an arrangement <b>100</b> according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement. The battery pack <b>300</b> has a housing <b>320</b> in which the battery cell <b>200</b> are arranged in a row. The position of the temperature sensors <b>104</b> is indicated on three of the battery cells <b>200</b>, specifically the two arranged on the outside and also that arranged in the middle. The two other battery cells can be embodied without an arrangement <b>100</b> for temperature measurement, or the temperature sensors can be located in a different position. Since the temperature sensors <b>104</b> generally do not measure in a targeted manner, the temperature of the battery cells <b>200</b> which are arranged adjacent to battery cells <b>200</b> provided with an arrangement <b>100</b> for temperature measurement is also detected. The affiliation of the temperature sensors <b>104</b> to respective battery cells <b>200</b> can be identified on the basis of their arrangement with respect to the contours. A single battery cell <b>200</b>, the temperature of which is increased, may possibly be determined by the temperature differences from adjacent battery cells.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a side view of an exemplary battery pack <b>300</b> with a plurality of battery cells <b>200</b> having arrangements <b>100</b> for temperature measurement.

In the case of battery cells <b>200</b>, the electrodes of which are arranged at opposite ends, these are generally arranged with respect to one another such that a positive electrode of one battery cell <b>200</b> comes to rest next to a negative electrode of an adjacent battery cell <b>200</b>, so that only short connecting lines are required. If an arrangement <b>100</b> for temperature measurement is always provided on the same electrode of each of the battery cells <b>200</b> (indicated by the temperature sensors <b>104</b> in the FIG.), the temperature can be monitored on two opposite sides of the battery cells <b>200</b> of the battery pack <b>300</b> in this way.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a flowchart of an exemplary method <b>400</b> for producing a battery cell <b>200</b> having an arrangement <b>100</b> according to aspects of the invention for temperature measurement.
