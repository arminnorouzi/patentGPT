Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical imaging technology is being used to capture images or video data of internal anatomical or physiological features of a subject or patient during medical or surgical procedures. The images or video data captured may be processed and manipulated to provide medical practitioners (e.g., surgeons, medical operator, technicians, etc.) with a visualization of internal structures or processes within a patient or subject.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Images or video data of internal anatomical or physiological features by a medical imaging apparatus (e.g., scope assembly) may be limited and often fail to provide complex anatomy or critical structures beneath the tissue surface. As a result, incomplete or incorrect identification of the target site may be dangerous and lead to unintended tissue damage during surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, sterile barrier assemblies such as surgical drapes are known for establishing barriers between surgical components during surgery. For instance, a surgical drape may be used to provide a sterile barrier with an optically clear window between a scope and an optical connector including a camera. In surgery, the scope is treated as being sterile, while the optical connector is nonsterile. The surgical drape creates a barrier between the scope and the optical connector to prevent contamination of a sterile field in which the optical connector is operating.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The surgical drape functionally prevents contamination of surgical components, but when the light emitted from the light source to recognize the target, passes through the surgical drape during surgical procedures, reflected light is generated from the window installed inside the surgical drape causes the practitioners to be misunderstood and confused in recognizing the target.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art for addressing one or more of these deficiencies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure addresses at least the above-mentioned shortcomings medical imaging systems.

The first portion <b>310</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to the optical connector <b>350</b> and the second portion <b>310</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to the sterile adapter <b>710</b>. The first sterile drape assembly <b>700</b> may comprise a sterile adapter <b>710</b>, a drape <b>730</b> and a locking ring <b>750</b>.

The sterile adapter <b>710</b> includes a first end <b>71</b> which attaches to the coupler <b>310</b>, and a second end <b>72</b> which may connect or disconnect to an endoscope (not shown). In embodiments, a window <b>73</b> may be positioned within the sterile adapter <b>710</b> for providing a sterile barrier between the coupler <b>310</b> and the endoscope. The sterile adapter <b>710</b> may comprise an endoscope mount <b>74</b> having an interior passageway <b>75</b> which optically communicates with the window <b>73</b>. Furthermore, the sterile adapter <b>710</b> may comprise an optical coupler mount <b>76</b> also including an interior passageway which communicates with the opposite side of the window <b>73</b>.

The Mechanism M is mounted transversely with respect to axis A-A which defines the longitudinal direction. In operation, a sliding quick release M may be depressed to enlarge the opening within interior passageway enabling an endoscope to be inserted therein. Upon relieving pressure on the M, a portion of quick release M then engages an eyepiece of the endoscope. A spring member (not shown) disposed within endoscope mount <b>74</b> provides the sliding quick release M with spring tension to releasably engage the endoscope. In embodiments, the drape <b>730</b> may include a drape ring <b>77</b> which may be constructed of a circular shaped wire that is integral with the distal end of the drape <b>730</b>.

In an example, the medical imaging apparatus may use hyperspectral imaging to identify the tissue type. The processor may be capable of employing one or more machine learning algorithms to analyze a database comprising a plurality of known or previously collected data sets (e.g., light spectra, images, or videos) related to a plurality of tissue or features thereof. The one or more machine learning algorithms may be capable of analyzing the light signal data set from the image sensor of the camera. The one or more machine learning algorithms may comprise an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network may involve a network of simple processing elements (i.e., artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters. With or without a training set (e.g., database of previously identified tissue sites and features thereof along with respective light signal data sets), the artificial neural network may enhance the analysis capability of the machine learning algorithms.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref> schematically illustrate a machine learning algorithm that is operatively coupled to the subject system for medical imaging in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the one or more machine learning algorithms of the present disclosure may comprise: (i) an input <b>2010</b> comprising image/video data that is collected from at least the medical imaging apparatus of the present disclosure, (ii) a machine learning module <b>2030</b> for analysis of the input <b>2010</b>, and (iii) an output <b>2050</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the artificial neural network of the one or more machine learning algorithms, for example, YOLO, may comprise an input layer (Backbone) <b>2110</b>, one or more hidden layers (PANet) <b>2130</b> including at least two hidden layers, and an output layer (Output) <b>2150</b>. The one or more hidden layers may take in input signals (e.g., the light signal data), analyze them, and convert them into an output (e.g., an identified tissue type). In some cases, first, the data is inputted to CSPDarknet for feature extraction. It is then fed to PANet for feature fusion. Lastly, the YOLO Layer outputs detection results, such as the class, score, location, and size. Faster R-CNN was also used to compare the performance with YOLO. Faster R-CNN object (e.g., a tissue) detection network is composed of a feature extraction network followed by a region proposal network to generate object proposals and another subnetwork to predict the actual class of each object proposal. The feature extraction network may be typically a pretrained CNN, such as ResNet-50 or Inception v3.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Meanwhile, in order to solve the problem of limited size of training data, the machine learning may be used a technique called transfer learning, where a model's structure and parameter trained for one task is reused as the starting point for another task. The neural networks may be initialized by the pretrained weights on the dataset. The dataset may be collected not only as clean images but also as low-quality, blurry images from videos to make a model robust to motion artifacts during surgery. Also, data augmentation may be used to improve network accuracy by randomly transforming the original data during training. It shall be noted that data augmentation is not applied to test and validation data. To take the images of low resolution in real-time situations into account, the data may be augmented by blurring the image with the probability of 0.1. To evaluate the trained object detector on a large set of images to measure the performance, Mean Average Precision (mAP) at different intersection over union (IoU) levels (mAP.5:.95) may be used as an evaluation metric for object (e.g., a tissue) detection. A general definition of the AP (Average Precision) may be calculating the area under the precision-recall curve. The precision-recall curve may be created by calculating precisions at each level of confidence threshold. The AP may provide a single number that incorporates the ability of the detector to make correct classifications (precision) and the ability of the detector to find all relevant objects (recall). For example, mAP.5:.95 means average AP over different IOU thresholds, from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some cases, the light signal data input may comprise at least wavelength (e.g., more than 3 wavelengths, up to 1000 wavelengths, etc.).
