Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine caffeine, choline, N,N<sup>1</sup>-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamin, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, &#x26;canine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0106">The preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts described above and other typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts is more fully described by Berg et al., &#x201c;Pharmaceutical Salts,&#x201d; <i>J Pharm.

The particles are formed by mixing lipids dissolved in alcohol with siRNA dissolved in a citrate buffer. The mixing ratio of lipids to siRNA are targeted at 45-55% lipid and 65-45% siRNA. The lipid solution contains a novel cationic lipid of the instant invention, a helper lipid (cholesterol) , PEG (e.g. PEG-C-DMA, PEG-DMG) lipid, and DSPC at a concentration of 5-15 mg/mL with a target of 9-12 mg/mL in an alcohol (for example ethanol). The ratio of the lipids has a mole percent range of 25-98 for the cationic lipid with a target of 35-65, the helper lipid has a mole percent range from 0-75 with a target of 30-50, the PEG lipid has a mole percent range from. 1-15 with a target of 1-6, and the DSPC has a mole precept range of 0-15 with a target of 0-12. The siRNA solution contains one or more siRNA sequences at a concentration range from 0.3 to 1 .0 mg/mL with a target of 0.3 -0.9 mg/mL in a sodium citrate buffered salt solution with pH in the range of 3.5-5. The two liquids are heated to a temperature in the range of 15-40&#xb0; C., targeting 30-40&#xb0; C., and then mixed in an impinging jet mixer instantly forming the LNP. The teeiD has a range from 0.25 to 1.0 MM and a total flow rate from 10 -600 mL/min. The combination of flow rate and tubing ID has effect of controlling the particle size of the LNPs between 30 and 200 nm. The solution is then mixed with a buffered solution at a higher pH with a mixing ratio in the range of 1:1 to 1:3 vol:vol but targeting 1:2 vol:vol. This buffered solution is at a temperature in the range of 15-40&#xb0; C., targeting 30-40&#xb0; C. The mixed LNPs are held from 30 minutes to 2 hrs prior to an anion exchange filtration step. The temperature during incubating is in the range of 15-40&#xb0; C., targeting 30-40&#xb0; C. After incubating the solution is filtered through a 0.8 um filter containing an anion exchange separation step. This process uses tubing IDs ranging from 1 mm ID to 5 mm ID and a flow rate from 10 to 2000 mL/min. The LNPs are concentrated and diafiltered via an ultrafiltration process where the alcohol is removed and the citrate buffer is exchanged for the final buffer solution such as phosphate buffered saline. The ultrafiltration process uses a tangential flow filtration format (TFF). This process uses a membrane nominal molecular weight cutoff range from 30 -500 KD. The membrane format can be hollow fiber or flat sheet cassette. The TFF processes with the proper molecular weight cutoff retains the LNP in the retentate and the filtrate or permeate contains the alcohol; citrate buffer; final buffer wastes. The TFF process is a multiple step process with an initial concentration to a siRNA concentration of 1 -3 mg/mL. Following concentration, the LNPs solution is diafiltered against the final buffer for 10 -20 volumes to remove the alcohol and perform buffer exchange. The material is then concentrated an additional 1-3 fold. The final steps of the LNP process are to sterile filter the concentrated LNP solution and vial the product.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Analytical Procedure:</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0143">1) siRNA Concentration</p><p id="p-0174" num="0144">The siRNA duplex concentrations are determined by Strong Anion-Exchange High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (SAX-HPLC) using Waters 2695 Alliance system (Water Corporation, Milford MA) with a 2996 PDA detector.

This is a two step process; the first is a concentration step taking the diluted material and concentrating approximately 8-fold, to a concentration of approximately 0.3-0.6 mg/mL siRNA.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0168">In the first step, a ring-stand with an ultrafiltration membrane 100 kDa PES (Spectrum Labs) installed is attached to a peristaltic pump (Spectrum KrosFloll System). 9.2 L of sterile distilled water is added to the reservoir; 3 L is drained to waste and the remainder is drained through permeate to waste. 5.3 L of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide is added to the reservoir with 1.5 L drained to waste and 3.1 L drained through permeate to waste. The remaining sodium hydroxide is held in the system for sanitization (at least 10 minutes), and then the pump is drained. 9.2 L of 70 (v/v) % isopropyl alcohol is added to the reservoir with 1.5 L drained to waste and the remainder drained through permeate to waste. 6 L of conditioning buffer (12.5% ethanol in phosphate buffered saline) is added with 1.5 L drained to waste and the remainder drained though the permeate until the waste is of neutral pH (7-8). A membrane flux value is recorded, and the pump is then drained.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0169">The diluted LNP solution is placed into the reservoir to the 1.1 L mark. The pump is turned on at 2.3 L/min. After 5 minutes of recirculation, the permeate pump is turned on at 62.5 mL/min and the liquid level is constant at approximately 950 mL in the reservoir. The diluted LNP solution is concentrated from 9.8 L to 1.1 L in 140 minutes, and the pump is paused when all the diluted LNP solution has been transferred to the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0170">The second step is a diafiltration step exchanging the ethanol/aqueous buffer to phosphate buffered saline. During this step, approximately 10-20 diafiltration volumes of phosphate buffered saline are used. Following diafiltration, a second concentration is undertaken to concentrate the LNP suspension 3-fold to approximately 1-1.5 mg/mL siRNA.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0171">The concentrated suspension is collected into sterile, plastic PETG bottles. The final suspension is then filtered sequentially via Pall 0.45 urn PBS and Pall 0.2 urn PES filters for terminal sterilization prior to vial filling.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0172">In an embodiment, an LNP composition of the instant invention comprises, a cationic lipid of Formula A, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG-DMG.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0173">In another embodiment, an LNP composition of the instant invention further comprises a cryoprotectant.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0174">In another embodiment, the cryoprotectant is Sucrose, Trehalose, Raffinose, Stachyose, Verbascose, Mannitol, Glucose, Lactose, Maltose, Maltotriose-heptaose, Dextran, Hydroxyethyl Starch, Insulin, Sorbitol, Glycerol, Arginine, Histidine, Lysine, Proline, Dimethylsulfoxide or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0175">In another embodiment, the cryoprotectant is Sucrose.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0176">In another embodiment, the cryoprotectant is Trehalose.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0177">In another embodiment, the cryoprotectant is a combination of Sucrose and Trehalose.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0178">In another embodiment, the LNP composition comprises, the cationic lipid (13Z,16Z)-N,N-dimethyl-3-nonyldocosa-13,16-dien-1-amine (Compound 32), cholesterol, DSPC and PEG-DMG.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0179">The obtained LNPs are characterized in terms of particle size, Zeta potential, alcohol content, total lipid content, nucleic acid encapsulated, and total nucleic acid concentration.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0180">One skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein.

The siRNA targets the mRNA transcript for the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>) luciferase gene (Accession # M15077). The primary sequence and chemical modification pattern of the luciferase siRNA is displayed above. The in vivo luciferase model employs a transgenic mouse in which the firefly luciferase coding sequence is present in all cells. ROSA26-LoxP-Stop-LoxP-Luc (LSL-Luc) transgenic mice licensed from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute are induced to express the Luciferase gene by first removing the LSL sequence with a recombinant Ad-Cre virus (Vector Biolabs). Due to the organo-tropic nature of the virus, expression is limited to the liver when delivered via tail vein injection. Luciferase expression levels in liver are quantitated by measuring light output, using an IVIS imager (Xenogen) following administration of the luciferin substrate (Caliper Life Sciences). Pre-dose luminescence levels are measured prior to administration of the RDVs. Lucifcrin in PBS (15 mg/mL) is intraperitoneally (IP) injected in a volume of 150 &#x3bc;L. After a four minute incubation period mice are anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in the IVIS imager. The RDVs (containing siRNA) in PBS vehicle were tail vein injected in a volume of 0.2 mL. Final dose levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg siRNA. PBS vehicle alone was dosed as a control. Mice were imaged 48 hours post dose using the method described above. Changes in luciferin light output directly correlate with luciferase mRNA levels and represent an indirect measure of luciferase siRNA activity. In vivo efficacy results are expressed as % inhibition of luminescence relative to pre-dose luminescence levels. Systemic administration of the luciferase siRNA RDVs decreased luciferase expression in a dose dependant manner. Greater efficacy was observed in mice dosed with Compound 1 containing RDVs than with the RDV containing the octyl-CLinDMA (OCD) cationic lipid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). OCD is known and described in WO 2010/021865.

TRE-MET mice are transgenic mice in an FVB/N genetic background where the human MET transgene is expressed under an hCMV promoter with heptamerized upstream tet-operators. When TRE-MET mice are crossed with the LAP-tTA line, the double transgenic (TRE-MET/LAP-tTA) mice express MET in a liver-specific manner which can be suppressed by administration of doxycycline. These mice develop HCC at &#x2dc;3 months of age with visually identifiable tumor nodules on the liver surface and the tumors display a diffuse trabecular growth pattern typical fox HCC and express the HCC tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In addition, the mutation analysis in the tumor of TRE-MET mice has also identified activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene in approximately 95% of tumors. These features make the TRE-MET HCC mouse model suitable for evaluating LNP-mediated delivery of &#x3b2;-catenin siRNA and the resultant efficacy on tumor growth.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0219">The effect of &#x3b2;-catenin containing LNPs in silencing &#x3b2;-catenin mRNA in both liver and tumor tissues was first evaluated in a pharmacodynamic (PD) study in TRE-MET mice bearing tumors.
