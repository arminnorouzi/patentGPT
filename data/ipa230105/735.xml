id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to formulations and use thereof in preventing skin damages, and the methods for preparing the formulations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Skin is one of the largest organs of the body. Skin is composed of two main layers: the surface epithelium or epidermis which includes the uppermost stratum corneum, and the subjacent connective tissue layer or dermis. Skin has several functions such as protecting the body from injury and dehydration, receiving environmental stimuli, excreting various substances, regulating body temperature, and helping to maintain water balance. Skin hydration is mostly linked to its water balance and water retention capacity and is important for maintaining the skin functions and health.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Radiation therapy has traditionally been the treatment of choice for locally or regionally advanced cancer. However, its therapeutic efficacy is often hindered by limited tolerance of normal tissues and by tumor radio-resistance. To improve therapeutic outcome, radiotherapy is frequently combined with chemotherapeutic drugs that may sensitize cells to radiation but are themselves cytotoxic. Skin damages due to radiation therapy represent the most frequent adverse effect of this life-saving treatment. In radiation therapy, the skin is exposed to extremely high energy radiation which exceeds its tolerability and protection capacity. Thus, the exposure of the skin to intense radiation energy causes severe dehydration and loss of its integrity. Radiation may cause severe burns of the skin and surrounding tissues as well as permanent changes in pigmentation. Consequently, the main clinical symptoms include skin redness, skin dryness, itching, blistering, peeling, and inflammation known as radiation dermatitis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, the health and integrity of skin may be compromised by wounds, abrasions, ulcers, burns, infections, irritations, premature birth, and other conditions for which normal skin production and repair processes may be inadequate. Prolonged exposure to UV radiation, such as from the sun, can lead to the formation of light dermatoses and erythema, as well as increase the risk of skin cancers, such as melanoma, and accelerate skin aging, such as loss of skin elasticity and wrinkling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Skin protection and treatments against skin damage encompass a variety of methods and products. These may range from protective skincare and pharmaceutical products, such as moisturizing creams, to symptomatic treatments, such as the use of topical anti-inflammatory compounds. Common remedies for skin protection contain a wide range of protective actives, including antioxidants, enzymes cofactors, humectants and other actives that may improve the healing of the damaged skin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The key factor for the skin protection effect is the duration of action. Due to the properties of the skin, most topical skincare and pharmaceutical remedies are eliminated from the skin after a short period of time. This elimination is mainly due to their wash-off from the skin surface by water, and/or due to the rapid absorption of the product constituents followed by rapid clearance to deeper tissues and to the blood circulation. This inherent nature of the skin shortens the retention of the absorbed ingredients and/or water in the stratum corneum. Thus, the efficacy of most topically applied products only lasts for a relatively short period of time at upper skin layers, which makes it necessary to use and dose frequently.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A wide range of studies have been conducted to prolong the skin protection effect of topical formulations. These approaches have led to the development of many skincare and pharmaceutical products based on oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions/dispersions. In w/o dispersions, the water droplets are dispersed in the oily continuous phase. O/w dispersions contain dispersed oil constituents such as droplets or particles, for example lipid-based micelles or vesicles, that are dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase. In the case of micelles, the dispersed vesicles may take various types of morphologies, such as capsules, liposomes and niosomes. The vesicular systems increase water entrapment and can also be used as vehicles for effective delivery of active agents to the skin.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to prevent the rapid wash-out and clearance of water and ingredients from the skin, there is an unmet need for topical formulations to have prolonged retention at the stratum corneum. There is also an urgent need for compositions which can provide protection against skin damages such as from exposure to radiation as well as preventing skin cancer reoccurrence.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure provides for a composition comprising an aqueous medium, lipids, and at least one nonionic surfactant.

The compositions have improved thermodynamic stability. The lipid phase and the lipid-based vesicles in the composition may contain oils, waxes and surfactants which are characterized by lamellar structures having one or more lipid layers separated from each other by aqueous layers. The lipid-based vesicles may have aqueous cores. Also encompassed by the present disclosure are methods of preparing the compositions and methods of preventing or reducing skin damage in a subject using the composition.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0096">The present disclosure provides a composition for skin protection where the composition exhibits significantly prolonged retention of water and other ingredients in the skin. The composition simulates the stratum corneum structure by dispersed, lamellar lipid-based vesicles in a continuous water phase. The morphology and size of the vesicles enable their prolonged retention in the skin and effective entrapment and delivery of a significant water and other ingredient payload to the upper layers of the skin for a prolonged time. Following the topical application of the composition, it is rapidly absorbed and protects the skin against damages, e.g., induced by radiation therapy. Notably, washing the skin with water does not interfere with the function of the composition due to its rapid absorption. More specifically, the aqueous dispersion of lamellar lipid-based vesicles exhibits significant retention in the stratum corneum which provides effective skin protection even with once daily application.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0097">The composition provides better hydration and bioavailability of active agents at the upper layers of the skin. By achieving this retention profile, the present composition provides effective and prolonged skin protection against dehydration and loss of integrity as well as a vehicle for effective delivery of active agents to the stratum corneum.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0098">The present disclosure provides for a composition comprising an aqueous medium, lipids, and at least one nonionic surfactant.

The trace element may be water-soluble. The trace elements may affect the lamellar structure of the cream matrix (or the composition) and/or of the dispersed lipid-based vesicles. In certain embodiments, in an oil-in-water emulsion having a nonionic surfactant, the specific types of the trace elements at specific concentrations, combined with the method of formulation, may enable the transition of the dispersed unilamellar lipid vesicles to multilamellar. In addition, the trace elements may induce a multilamellar morphology and order of the lamellas of the cream matrix which thus increases the viscosity of the cream base. The multilamellar texture of the cream bases (or the composition) significantly increases its water load which prolongs water retention in the skin and acts as effective vehicles for the delivery of water-soluble and/or lipophilic active agents to the skin.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0123">In certain embodiments, the specific trace elements and their specific concentrations ranges enable a controlled coacervation of the lipid phase in the oil-in-water emulsion system.

Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are amphoteric trace elements. They may exist in the water phase as either cations or anions, with their valency ranging from &#x2212;2 to +6. The trace elements may also include a trace element that have an oxidative state similar to those of selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn), and a trace element that can act as an effective coacervation-inducing agent in a nonionic surfactant-based emulsion.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0125">In one embodiment, the present composition contains an oil-in-water emulsion that comprises about 20% lipids/oils and about 60% of an aqueous medium emulsified with a relatively high concentration (about 15%) of surfactants. The relatively high surfactant concentration enables the compatibility of trace elements with the dispersion constituents. Moreover, it enables a controlled coacervation of the dispersed lipid-based vesicles and their transition from unilamellar to multilamellar nano-sized and/or micro-sized capsules. The trace elements induce controlled coacervation to produce dispersed multilamellar lipid-based vesicles in a nonionic surfactant-based, water-in-oil emulsion of a cream base having a lamellar matrix. The process of making the present composition having a lamellar vesicular system is relatively simple compared to the known methods in the art of particle sciences such as the methods to make niosomes.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0126">The microscopic morphology and physical properties of the lipid-based vesicles and the microscopic texture of the cream bases have been studied in detail.

In some embodiments, said skin damage or disorder is radiation dermatitis or radiodermatitis.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Radiotherapy (Radiation Therapy)</heading><p id="p-0177" num="0188">Radiation therapy works by directing ionizing radiation into the area being treated with the goal of damaging the genetic material of cancerous cells thereby making it impossible for these cells to divide. Accordingly, radiotherapy is an important tool in the fight against cancer and is used in the treatment many cancer patients. Other terms for radiotherapy include radiation therapy, x-ray therapy, electron beam therapy, cobalt therapy, or irradiation.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0189">Radiotherapy is especially useful in cases where surgical removal of the cancer is not possible, where surgery might debilitate the patient, or where surgical debulking of the tumor has not absolutely removed all cancerous tissue. Radiotherapy is routinely used following surgery to destroy any cancer cells that were not removed by surgery. Further uses of radiotherapy are prior to surgery where it can &#x201c;shrink&#x201d; a previously inoperable tumor down to a manageable size to enable surgical excision.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0190">Radiation therapy can also be used to help relieve symptoms of advanced cancer (such as bleeding or pain), even if a cure is not possible. Over one-third of the practice of radiation therapy is palliative. The typical intent of palliative treatment is to relieve pain quickly and maintain symptom control for the duration of the patient's life. Accordingly, treatment is usually tailored to the patient's clinical condition and overall prognosis. Palliative treatment is often complementary to analgesic drug therapies and may enhance their effectiveness because it can directly target the cause of pain.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0191">Specifically, radiotherapy can be used to treat localized solid tumors, such as cancers of the skin, head and neck, brain, breast, prostate, cervix, and the like. Radiation therapy can also be used to treat cancers of the blood-forming cells and lymphatic system including leukemia and lymphoma respectively, and the like. Skin cells in the vicinity of the radiation or in the path of the radiation can be protected using the present invention.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0192">External beam radiation therapy commonly uses photons to treat cancer. In some embodiments, radiation includes ultraviolet (UV) rays and particularly UV-A and UV-B radiation such as from the sun. Ultraviolet radiation between 290 nm and 320 nm (&#x201c;UV-A&#x201d;) has been known to rapidly produce damage to the human skin. Also, the human skin has been known to be affected by UV radiation between 320-400 nm (&#x201c;UV-B&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0193">It is an object herein to ameliorate the negative effects of all radiotherapy regardless of the form of the photon or particle, including x-rays, gamma rays, UV rays including UV-A, UV-B and UV-C, neutrons, protons, and electrons including beta particles and the like. In some embodiments, laser includes laser beam used in laser therapy for cosmetic skin treatments and hair removal. Currently, 1064 nm wavelength is approved by FDA for permanent hair reduction.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0194">X-rays are a very common form of radiation used in radiotherapy. Gamma rays are another form of photons used in radiotherapy. Gamma rays can be produced spontaneously as certain elements (such as radium, uranium, and cobalt 60), which release radiation as they decompose, or decay. Each element decays at a specific rate and can give off energy in the form of gamma rays and other particles. Typically x-rays and gamma rays have the same general effect on cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0195">External beam radiation therapy can be delivered by means of a linear accelerator. Typically, linear accelerators use powerful generators to create the high energy rays for external beam radiation therapy. Generally, linear accelerators can produce x-rays at various energies. The linear accelerator can include a special set of lead shutters, called collimators, which focus and direct the rays to the tumor. The linear accelerator can be a large &#x201c;L-shaped&#x201d; design which allows it to rotate and deliver radiation from all angles. Multiple angles allow the maximum amount of radiation to be delivered to the tumor while delivering a minimal amount of radiation to the surrounding healthy tissue. The formulations and methods described herein can be used in conjunction with collimators or other devices and methods that limit radiation exposure to normal cells.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0196">The present compositions and methods described herein can ameliorate the effects of radiotherapy on skin cells. For example, the compositions and methods can ameliorate the effects of local-field radiation and wide-field radiation. Local field radiation relates to a narrow beam of radiation directed at the specific metastatic site or sites. Customarily, local field radiation has tended to be used for patients with a long life expectancy and fewer metastatic sites. In contrast, wide-field radiation employs a larger field of radiation and is often used to treat patients with a shorter life expectancy and multiple metastatic pain-causing sites.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0197">Radiotherapy dosage is measured by the scientific unit rad (radiation absorbed dose) which is a radiation energy dose equal to energy of 100 ergs per gram of irradiated material. A patient who receives radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer can receive several thousand rads over a very short period of time (weeks or months). In contrast, a typical scanning x-ray contains far fewer rads. For example, modern mammography systems used to take x-ray images of the breast use approximately 0.1 to 0.2 rad dose per x-ray.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0198">In general, radiation therapy is a local treatment. It typically affects the cells in the treated area. However, in addition to damaging cancer cells, radiation can also damage normal cells located in the treated area and particularly skin cells in the radiation path. Radiation side effects are typically restricted to the radiation portal and can be classified as acute, occurring during or immediately after the course of radiation therapy, or late, occurring months to years later. Acute radiation effects are more prominent with radiation schedules that deliver high total doses of radiation with small daily fractions; they generally begin at the end of the second week of therapy. Acute radiation effects, occurring at skin surfaces, usually consist of an inflammatory response such as skin erythema or pigmentation. Late radiation effects may arise without any preceding acute reactions. Fibrosis is the most common type oflate radiation injury and can be observed in many types of tissue, including skin.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0199">Other skin conditions caused by radiation therapy include dry and moist desquamation. Dry desquamation, which is characterized by dry and flaky skin and pruritus in the area of irradiation. Moist desquamation, is characterized by sloughing of the epidermis, exposing the moist, raw, dermis layer of the skin.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0200">One objective described herein is to ameliorate the negative effects of radiation therapy on normal skin cells, regardless of whether the effect is acute or late.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions</heading><p id="p-0190" num="0201">The present composition may contain a carrier.

These mixtures may have at least two immiscible phases such as water and oil. A mixture may contain a dispersed phase in a continuous phase. The dispersed phase may be droplets, vesicles, or particles. An example of such a mixture is an emulsion. There are two main types of emulsions: oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions which are composed of small droplets of oil dispersed in a continuous water phase, and water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions which are composed of small droplets of water dispersed in a continuous oil phase. Oil-in-water emulsions are comfortable to use topically and cosmetically acceptable, as they are not very greasy and can be easily washed off by water. Although oil-in-water emulsions can rapidly deliver water to the skin, their moisturizing effect may only last for a relatively short period of time and consequently provide limited water retention for the skin. On the other hand, water-in-oil emulsions can be moisturizing, as they provide an oily barrier which reduces water loss from the stratum corneum.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0245">In one embodiment, creams are semi-solid emulsions which may not as thermodynamically stable as the liquid emulsions. The inherent thermodynamic entropies of each of the emulsified phases (oils and water) dominate the separation of dispersed phases within time. The most common method to increase the physical stability of emulsions and to extend their shelf-life is to mix the two immiscible liquids in the presence of emulsifiers. The most common emulsifiers used in skincare and pharmaceutical topical products are known as surface active agents or surfactants.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0246">Surfactants may be amphiphilic. They typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e., water-soluble) head and a non-polar (i.e., hydrophobic or lipophilic) tail. The measure of the surfactant capability to emulsify various proportions of oils and water is known as the Hydrophilic-Lipophilic-Balance (HLB). The degree of HLB enables the prediction of the surfactant solubility in either oil or water. Hence, the HLB classification scale provides the basis for selection of effective surfactants for the emulsification of oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions. Accordingly, surfactants with HLB values of less than 10 are considered as lipid-soluble (water-insoluble) and those that have HLB above 10 are water-soluble (lipid-insoluble). The HLB classification scale is used for selections of surfactants according to the required HLB of the emulsion constituents. Accordingly, most oil-in-water emulsions have an HLB range of 8-16, and water-in-oil emulsions usually have an HLB range of 3-6. In the common practice of emulsion preparations, the emulsification efficacy may be controlled by factors including the types and percentages of the selected surfactant. In some cases, stable emulsions may be obtained by a combination of two or more surfactants in the system.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0247">The surfactants can act by their ability to adsorb to the surface of the dispersed droplets. Their typical structure and thermodynamics can enable their diffusion and orientation at the interface between the dispersed droplets and the continuous phase. This distinctive orientation can enable surfactants to reduce the interfacial tension between the dispersed phases and to reduce the surface energy and the thermodynamic instability of the dispersion system.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0248">Surfactants can be classified according to the types of their polar head groups. Ionic surfactants can include carriers of net positive charge such as cationic surfactants, or negative charge such as anionic surfactants. An amphoteric surfactant can contain a head with two oppositely charged groups.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0249">The emulsification mechanism of ionic surfactants can be determined by the type of charge of the head groups. Cationic and anionic surfactants can enable stable dispersion by increasing the electrostatic repulsion forces between the dispersed droplets. The dispersion system can be stabilized due to the electrostatic repulsions elicited by the ionic surfactants adsorbed at the interface of the dispersed droplets which diffuse the droplets and maintain them in the dispersed state.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0250">In certain embodiments, the present composition is an oil-in-water emulsion containing at least one nonionic surfactant. The concentration of the nonionic surfactant(s) may range from about 1% to about 5% (w/w) in the composition. The nonionic surfactant may have an HLB ranging from about 8 to about 16.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0251">Without limiting the invention to a particular theory or mechanism of action, the trace elements may act by inducing coacervation in emulsions made of nonionic surfactants. Nonionic surfactants may form a molecular barrier between the dispersed droplets known as the steric effect which is characterized by relatively weak intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the stability of nonionic surfactants-based emulsions is much more sensitive to the presence of ions in the system than the ionic surfactants-based emulsions.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0252">Coacervates are organic-rich droplets formed via liquid-liquid phase-separation, mainly resulting from association of oppositely charged molecules. More specifically, coacervation refers to the production of coacervate colloidal droplets. When coacervation occurs, two liquid phases will co-exist: a dense, polymer-rich phase (coacervate phase or coacervate droplets) and a very dilute, polymer-deficient phase (dilute phase). In some cases, the coacervation approach is applied in order to increase the viscosity and consistency of the emulsion. This coacervation may be performed under controlled conditions, such as the temperature, the concentrations of the coacervation-inducing agents, and the type and concentration of the emulsifying surfactants. Coacervation-inducing agents may be substances that have ionic charges such as ionic polymers or salts (electrolytes). When salts are added to the emulsion, they reduce the existing repulsive forces (induced attraction) between the dispersive droplets. This effect may be limited to the specific and controlled conditions of the system. More specifically, the coacervation may be mostly dependent on the type of ions derived from the trace elements (anion or cation, monovalent or multivalent) and a range of concentrations of the conservation-inducing agent and the emulsion constituents. For example, an increase of the concentration of the coacervation-inducing agent may cause a loss of balance between the surfactants and the dispersed droplets and a disruption of the emulsion consistency and stability. Due to the electrostatic nature of the coacervation phenomenon, this mechanism can be relevant to salts and ionic surfactants-based emulsions rather than nonionic surfactants-based emulsions. In certain embodiments, specific trace elements may induce a controlled coacervation in a nonionic surfactant-based emulsion. More specifically, the specific trace elements may be cationic ions having at least bivalent charges, including, but not limited to, selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). Surprisingly, these elements may elicit a transition of the dispersed unilamellar lipid-based vesicles to multilamellar structures in a nonionic surfactant-based oil-in-water emulsion.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0253">Controlled coacervation may relate to a quantitative measurement of the ions charge and their concentration as a function of the electrostatic effects applied to the dispersion system. The measure of this effect may include the zeta (Z) potential. The Z-potential enables the detection of electrostatic fields between the dispersed droplets and it serves as a descriptive 30 measure to confirm the coacervation mechanism, the trace elements effects and its control. In the practice of emulsions, the Z-potential values of above &#x2212;20 mV or +20 mV are considered as stable dispersion.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0254">The present disclosure provides for the method of controlled coacervation and its physical effects of the cream constituents. More specifically, the present disclosure provides for the specific trace elements, their concentrations and conditions of use to control the coacervation of the oil-in-water cream base. The trace elements can affect the unique microscopic texture of the cream base and the morphology and physical properties of the dispersed lipid-based vesicles. The present method may produce a unique lamellar texture of the cream matrix. The lamellar matrix may comprise dispersed, multilamellar lipid-based vesicles that have distinctive morphology and function. The differentiated morphology and function of the dispersed multilamellar lipid-based vesicles can enhance the entrapment of water payload, to improve the encapsulation efficiency and the delivery of the active agent and to maximize the skin protection effect against radiation-induced skin damage for a prolonged period of time.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0255">In the discussion unless otherwise stated, adjectives such as &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; and &#x201c;about&#x201d; modifying a condition or relationship characteristic of a feature or features of an embodiment of the invention, are understood to mean that the condition or characteristic is defined to within tolerances that are acceptable for operation of the embodiment for an application for which it is intended.

Without wishing to be bound by any specific mechanism, the minerals may play a role in skin protection due to their physical effect on the cream base.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0277">We studied the physical roles of the minerals in the cream base.

This outcome is correlated with the use of Tween 80 as a nonionic surfactant for oil-in-water emulsions. We used a relatively high load of oil phase (the weight ratio of the lipids to the aqueous medium was 4:5) in order to observe mild (but not maximal) emulsification of Tween 80 as a baseline for reliable evaluations of the trace elements effects. As indicated from Samples EEE and FFF, the addition of selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) in a final concentration of 0.03 wt % and 0.18 wt % surprisingly increased the emulsification capacity by a significant manner in this repeated study. Considering the lack of interaction between selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) with the oils, as depicted in Example 9, these data support the conclusion that the selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) induced coacervation may be associated with the nonionic surfactant mode of emulsification.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Example 17</heading><p id="p-0337" num="0360"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows oil-in-water basic emulsions emulsified with the nonionic surfactant Tween-80 as an exemplary surfactant.

Note that the ratio of lipids/aqueous medium was reduced to 1:2 in order to enable optimal conditions for the Tween 80 to emulsify the phases. However, the increased concentration of NaCl exceeded the threshold of coacervation and induced a salt-out effect of the surfactant as indicated by the significant foam at the image taken from the upper side of the sample (the bottom photo).

The viability of human epidermal skin cells was evaluated by the MTT ((3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay at 48 hours post UVB irradiation. All tested groups were performed in replicates of n=5 per group. The data shows the significant effect of UVB irradiation on skin viability (control versus sham control), a reduction of sham control viability levels by 42&#xb1;3% with significance of p=0.002.

The data shows that UVB irradiation induced IL-8 release significantly at 24 hours post UVB irradiation. All tested groups were performed in replicates of n=3 per group. UVB-irradiated human skin grafts released about six times higher levels of IL-8 compared to the sham control (p=0.01). Pretreatment of the skin graft by the positive control (commercial SPF-15 sunscreen) inhibited the UVB-induced IL-8 release by about 40% (p=0.05). Under the same experimental conditions, the Group 1 composition (ARC, an embodiment of the present composition) inhibited the UVB-induced IL-8 release by about 80% (p=0.02). The data demonstrate that the present composition can provide about 2-fold of potency against IL-8 release compared to the positive control (the SPF-15 sunscreen).</p><heading id="h-0034" level="2">Conclusions</heading><p id="p-0351" num="0371">The present composition demonstrated significant skin protection effects. The high water entrapment efficiency of the multilamellar matrix of the composition helps protect human epidermal cells against UV-induced photoaging and inflammatory effects. This effect protects the skin against UVB radiation without the use of chemical UV filters. The data emphasize the efficacy of the aqueous oil-in-water multilamellar matrix to hydrate the extracellular microenvironment of the skin layers exposed to radiation and to protect the human skin against tissue damage and inflammation. Moreover, the results of the SPF test show that the present composition can protect patients against radiation dermatitis without interfering with the radiation efficacy to treat cancer.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0372">The scope of the present invention is not limited by what has been specifically shown and described hereinabove.
