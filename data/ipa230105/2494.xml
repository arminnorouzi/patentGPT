TAO is divided into two types. Active TAO, which typically lasts 1-3 years, is characterized by an ongoing autoimmune/inflammatory response in the soft tissues of the orbit. Active TAO is responsible for the expansion and remodeling of the ocular soft tissues. The autoimmune/inflammatory response of active TAO spontaneously resolves and the condition transitions into inactive TAO. Inactive TAO is the term used to describe the long-term/permanent sequelae of active TAO. The cause of TAO is unknown. TAO is typically associated with Graves' hyperthyroidism, but can also occur as part of other autoimmune conditions that affect the thyroid gland and produce pathology in orbital and periorbital tissue, and, rarely, the pretibial skin (pretibial myxedema) or digits (thyroid acropachy). TAO is an autoimmune orbitopathy in which the orbital and periocular soft tissues are primarily affected with secondary effects on the eye and vision. In TAO, as a result of inflammation and expansion of orbital soft tissues, primarily eye muscles and adipose, the eyes are forced forward (bulge) out of their sockets&#x2014;a phenomenon termed proptosis or exophthalmos. Although most cases of TAO do not result in loss of vision, this condition can cause vision-threatening exposure keratopathy, troublesome diplopia (double vision), and compressive dysthyroid optic neuropathy. TAO may precede, coincide with, or follow the systemic complications of dysthyroidism. The ocular manifestations of TAO include upper eyelid retraction, lid lag, swelling, redness (erythema), conjunctivitis, and bulging eyes (exophthalmos or proptosis), chemosis, periorbital edema, and altered ocular motility with significant functional, social, and cosmetic consequences. Many of the signs and symptoms of TAO, including proptosis and ocular congestion, result from expansion of the orbital adipose tissue and periocular muscles. The adipose tissue volume increases owing in part to new fat cell development (adipogenesis) within the orbital fat. The accumulation of hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans, primarily hyaluronic acid, within the orbital adipose tissue and the perimysial connective tissue between the extraocular muscle fibers, further expands the fat compartments and enlarges the extraocular muscle bodies. Hyaluronic acid is produced by fibroblasts residing within the orbital fat and extraocular muscles, and its synthesis in vitro is stimulated by several cytokines and growth factors, including IL-1beta, interferon-gamma, platelet-derived growth factor, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) have also been detected and implicated in active TAO. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that TSHR and IGF-IR form a physical and functional complex in orbital fibroblasts, and that blocking IGF-IR appears to attenuate both IGF-1 and TSH-dependent signaling. It has been suggested that blocking IGF-IR using an antibody antagonist might reduce both TSHR- and IGF-I-dependent signaling and therefore interrupt the pathological activities of autoantibodies acting as agonists on either receptor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IGF-IR is a widely expressed heterotetrameric protein involved in the regulation of proliferation and metabolic function of many cell types. It is a tyrosine kinase receptor comprising two subunits. IGF-IRalpha contains a ligand-binding domain while IGF-IRbeta is involved in signaling and contains tyrosine phosphorylation sites.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current therapies for hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease are imperfect because therapies targeting the specific underlying pathogenic autoimmune mechanisms of the disease are lacking. Even more complex is the treatment of moderate-to-severe active TAO. Although recent years have witnessed a better understanding of its pathogenesis, TAO remains a therapeutic challenge and dilemma. There are no approved drugs to treat active TAO. Intravenous glucocorticoids (ivGCs) and oral glucocorticoids are used to treat patients with moderate-to-severe active TAO, but results are seldom satisfactory. Partial responses are frequent and relapses (rebound) after drug withdrawal are not uncommon. Adverse events do occur and many patients eventually require rehabilitative surgery conducted when their condition has transitioned to inactive TAO. Accordingly, there is still a need to provide alternative therapies for TAO and its related symptoms.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embodiments relate generally to IGF-1R antibodies, and antigen binding fragments thereof.

The antibodies can be used, for example, to treat thyroid eye disease.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, &#x201c;Thyroid-associated Ophthalmopathy&#x201d; (TAO), &#x201c;Thyroid Eye Disease&#x201d; (TED), &#x201c;Graves' Ophthalmopathy&#x201d; or &#x201c;Graves' Orbitopathy&#x201d; (GO) refer to the same disorder or condition and are used interchangeably. They all refer to the inflammatory orbital pathology associated with some autoimmune thyroid disorders, most commonly with &#x201c;Graves' Disease&#x201d; (GD), but sometimes with other diseases, e.g. Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The terms &#x201c;proptosis&#x201d; and &#x201c;exophthalmos&#x201d; (also known as exophthalmos, exophthalmia, or exorbitism) refer to the forward projection, displacement, bulging, or protrusion of an organ. As used herein, the terms refer to the forward projection, displacement, bulging, or protrusion of the eye anteriorly out of the orbit. Proptosis and exophthalmos are considered by some of skill in the art to have the same meaning and are often used interchangeably, while others attribute subtle differences to their meanings. Exophthalmos is used by some to refer to severe proptosis; or to refer to endocrine-related proptosis. Yet others use the term exophthalmos when describing proptosis associated with the eye, in, for example, subjects with TAO (TED or GO).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;proptosis&#x201d; and &#x201c;exophthalmos&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to the forward projection, displacement, bulging, or protrusion of the eye anteriorly out of the orbit. Owing to the rigid bony structure of the orbit with only anterior opening for expansion, any increase in orbital soft tissue contents taking place from the side or from behind will displace the eyeball forward. Proptosis or exophthalmos can be the result of a several disease processes including infections, inflammations, tumors, trauma, metastases, endocrine lesions, vascular diseases &#x26; extra orbital lesions. TAO (TED or GO) is currently recognized as the most common cause of proptosis in adults. Exophthalmos can be either bilateral, as is often seen in TAO (TED or GO), or unilateral (as is often seen in an orbital tumor).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Measurement of the degree of exophthalmos can be performed using, for example, an exophthalmometer, an instrument used for measuring the degree of forward displacement of the eye. The device allows measurement of the forward distance of the lateral orbital rim to the front of the cornea. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and Magnetic resonance imaging (MM) may also be used in evaluating the degree of exophthalmos or proptosis. CT scanning is an excellent imaging modality for the diagnosis of TAO. In addition to allowing visualization of the enlarged extraocular muscles, CT scans provide the surgeon or clinician with depictions of the bony anatomy of the orbit when an orbital decompression is required. MM, with its multi-planar and inherent contrast capabilities, provides excellent imaging of the orbital contents without the radiation exposure associated with CT scan studies. Mill provides better imaging of the optic nerve, orbital fat, and extraocular muscle, but CT scans provide better views of the bony architecture of the orbit. Orbital ultrasonography can also be a used for the diagnosis and evaluation of TAO, because it can be performed quickly and with a high degree of confidence. High reflectivity and enlargement of the extraocular muscles are assessed easily, and serial ultrasonographic examinations can also be used to assess progression or stability of the ophthalmopathy.

Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.

In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) <i>Trends Biochem. Sci. </i>26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) <i>J. Immunol. Methods </i>231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V<sub>H </sub>domains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d; refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V<sub>H</sub>) connected to a light chain variable domain (V<sub>L</sub>) in the same polypeptide chain (V<sub>H</sub>-V<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>L</sub>-V<sub>H</sub>). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>23:1126-1136.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Typically, a variant antibody or antigen binding fragment of the antibodies provided herein retain at least 10% of its IGF-1R binding activity (when compared to a parental antibody that is modified) when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. In some embodiments, a variant antibody (or antigen fragment thereof), or antigen binding fragment of an antibody provided herein, retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the IGF-1R binding affinity as the parental antibody. As described herein, it is also intended that an antibody or antigen binding fragment of the invention can include conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, which can also be referred to as &#x201c;conservative variants&#x201d; or &#x201c;function conserved variants&#x201d; of the antibody, that do not substantially alter its biologic activity.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">&#x201c;Isolated antibody&#x201d; refers to the purification status of a binding compound and in such context means the molecule is substantially free of other biological molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth media. Generally, the term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; is not intended to refer to a complete absence of such material or to an absence of water, buffers, or salts, unless they are present in amounts that substantially interfere with experimental or therapeutic use of the binding compound as described herein.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the antibody molecules comprising the population are identical in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of different antibodies having different amino acid sequences in their variable domains, particularly their CDRs, that are often specific for different epitopes. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) <i>Nature </i>256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) <i>Nature </i>352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) <i>J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. </i>116:731.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">As used herein, a &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>81: 6851-6855). Typically the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the &#x201c;parental antibody&#x201d;), such as a rodent, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental (e.g. rodent) antibody.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., murine, rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The term &#x201c;fully human antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, &#x201c;mouse antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only. Alternatively, a fully human antibody may contain rat carbohydrate chains if produced in a rat, in a rat cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a rat cell. Similarly, &#x201c;rat antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that comprises rat immunoglobulin sequences only.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In general, the basic antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; (about 25 kDa) and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain may define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a &#x201c;J&#x201d; region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a &#x201c;D&#x201d; region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, <i>Fundamental Immunology </i>Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">Typically, the variable domains of both the heavy and light chains comprise three hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs), located within relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The CDRs are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chains variable domains comprise FR1, CDR1, FR2 , CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is, generally, in accordance with the definitions of <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, </i>Kabat, et al.; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; 5<sup>th </sup>ed.; NIH Publ.

Mol. Biol. </i>196: 901-917). As used herein, the term &#x201c;framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR&#x201d; residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues. CDRs provide the majority of contact residues for the binding of the antibody to the antigen or epitope.

Included within the definition of &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; is a protein-encoding nucleic acid. An &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; can also refer to the binding partner of an antibody. In some embodiments, the antigen is the IGF-1R protein expressed on the surface of a cell. In some embodiments, the cell is an intact cell. An intact cell is a cell that has not been lysed or broken open with the use of detergents or other reagents. A cell that has been treated with detergents or other reagents that breaks up the cellular membrane or punches holes in a cellular membrane is not an intact cell. For example, methods are provided herein for generating an antibody that binds to a IGF-1R protein, the method comprising culturing a cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding the IGF-1R antibody.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">As used herein, &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunospecific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;binds immunospecifically&#x201d; refer to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen (e.g. IGF-1R) or epitope present on the antigen. In some embodiments, the antibody binds with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M or less, and binds to the predetermined antigen with a K<sub>D </sub>that is at least two-fold less than its K<sub>D </sub>for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein, or another non-specific polypeptide) other than the predetermined antigen. The phrases &#x201c;an antibody recognizing IGF-1R &#x201d; and &#x201c;an antibody specific for IGF-1R&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein with the term &#x201c;an antibody which binds immunospecifically to IGF-1R.&#x201d; Reference in the present disclosure may be made to IGF-1R. The degree of specificity necessary for an anti-IGF-1R antibody may depend on the intended use of the antibody, and at any rate is defined by its suitability for use for an intended purpose. In some embodiments, the antibody, or binding compound derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen (IGF-1R), with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, at least ten times greater, at least 20-times greater, or at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antigen.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">Methods for determining mAb specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988), Colligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1992, 1993), and Muller, Meth.

In some embodiments, the antibody has conservative substitutions as compared to a sequence described herein. Exemplary conservative substitutions are illustrated in Table 1 and are encompassed within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. The conservative substitution may reside in the framework regions, or in antigen-binding sites, as long they do not adversely affect the properties of the antibody. Substitutions may be made to improve antibody properties, for example stability or affinity. Conservative substitutions will produce molecules having functional and chemical characteristics similar to those molecules into which such modifications are made.

Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Example of epitopes include, but are not limited to, the residues described herein that form IGF-1R epitopes. In some embodiments, the epitope is only present in a non-denatured protein.

Once the sequences are known, the antibodies can also be generated according to known methods. The antibodies can also be converted to different types, such as being converted to Human IgGs and the like. By converting the antibodies to a human antibody, a human subject should not identify the antibodies as foreign. The conversion of a non-human IgG antibody to a human IgG antibody is well known and can routinely be done once the native sequence is known. As discussed herein, the antibodies can be modified according to known methods. Such methods are described in, for example, Riechmann L, Clark M, Waldmann H, Winter G (1988).

The antibody-producing cell contributing the nucleotide sequences encoding the antigen-binding region of the chimeric antibody can also be produced by transformation of a non-human, such as a primate, or a human cell. For example, a B lymphocyte which produces the antibody can be infected and transformed with a virus such as Epstein-Barr virus to yield an immortal antibody producing cell (Kozbor et al., Immunol.

A convenient alternative to the use of chromosomal gene fragments as the source of DNA encoding the V region antigen-binding segment is the use of cDNA for the construction of chimeric immunoglobulin genes, e.g., as reported by Liu et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 84:3439 (1987) and J. Immunology 139:3521 (1987), which references are hereby entirely incorporated herein by reference. The use of cDNA requires that gene expression elements appropriate for the host cell be combined with the gene in order to achieve synthesis of the desired protein. The use of cDNA sequences is advantageous over genomic sequences (which contain introns), in that cDNA sequences can be expressed in bacteria or other hosts which lack appropriate RNA splicing systems.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">For example, a cDNA encoding a V region antigen-binding segment able to detect, bind, to or neutralize a IGF-1R antigen can be provided using known methods based on the use of the amino acid sequences provided herein. Because the genetic code is degenerate, more than one codon can be used to encode a particular amino acid (Watson, et al., infra). Using the genetic code, one or more different oligonucleotides can be identified, each of which would be capable of encoding the amino acid. The probability that a particular oligonucleotide will, in fact, constitute the actual XXX-encoding sequence can be estimated by considering abnormal base pairing relationships and the frequency with which a particular codon is actually used (to encode a particular amino acid) in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells expressing an antibody or fragment. Such &#x201c;codon usage rules&#x201d; are disclosed by Lathe, et al., J. Molec. Biol. 183:1 12 (1985). Using the &#x201c;codon usage rules&#x201d; of Lathe, a single oligonucleotide, or a set of oligonucleotides, that contains a theoretical &#x201c;most probable&#x201d; nucleotide sequence capable of encoding an antibody variable or constant region sequences is identified.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">The variable regions described herein can be combined with any type of constant region including a human constant region or murine constant region. Human genes which encode the constant (C) regions of the antibodies, fragments and regions can be derived from a human fetal liver library, by known methods. Human C regions genes can be derived from any human cell including those which express and produce human immunoglobulins. The human C<sub>H </sub>region can be derived from any of the known classes or isotypes of human H chains, including gamma, &#x3bc;, &#x3b1;, &#x3b4; or &#x3b5;, and subtypes thereof, such as G1, G2, G3 and G4. Since the H chain isotype is responsible for the various effector functions of an antibody, the choice of C<sub>H </sub>region will be guided by the desired effector functions, such as complement fixation, or activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Preferably, the C<sub>H </sub>region is derived from gamma 1 (IgG1), gamma 3 (IgG3), gamma 4 (IgG4), or &#x3bc; (IgM). The human C<sub>L </sub>region can be derived from either human L chain isotype, kappa or lambda. In some embodiments, the antibody comprises a Fc domain. In some embodiments, the Fc domain comprises a mutation to extend the half-life of the antibody. In some embodiments, the Fc domain comprises a mutation such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,670,600, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiment, the constant region comprises a mutation at position at amino acid residue 428 relative to a wild-type human IgG constant domain, numbered according to the EU numbering index of Kabat. Without being bound to any particular theory, an antibody comprising a mutation that corresponds to residue 428 can have an increased half-life compared to the half-life of an IgG having the wild-type human IgG constant domain. In some embodiments, the mutation is a substitution of the native residue with a threonine, leucine, phenylalanine or serine. In some embodiments, the antibody further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions relative to the corresponding wild-type human IgG constant domain at one or more of amino acid residues 251-256, 285-290, 308-314, 385-389, and 429-436, numbered according to the Kabat EU numbering index.

(Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1987 1993)). Human C region genes are readily available from known clones containing genes representing the two classes of L chains, the five classes of H chains and subclasses thereof. Chimeric antibody fragments, such as F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>and Fab, can be prepared by designing a chimeric H chain gene which is appropriately truncated. For example, a chimeric gene encoding an H chain portion of an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment would include DNA sequences encoding the CH<sub>1 </sub>domain and hinge region of the H chain, followed by a translational stop codon to yield the truncated molecule.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">In some embodiments, the antibodies, murine, human, humanized, or chimeric antibodies, fragments and regions of the antibodies described herein are produced by cloning DNA segments encoding the H and L chain antigen-binding regions of a IGF-1R antigen specific antibody, and joining these DNA segments to DNA segments encoding C<sub>H </sub>and C<sub>L </sub>regions, respectively, to produce murine, human or chimeric immunoglobulin-encoding genes.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">Thus, in some embodiments, a fused chimeric gene is created which comprises a first DNA segment that encodes at least the antigen-binding region of non-human origin, such as a functionally rearranged V region with joining (J) segment, linked to a second DNA segment encoding at least a part of a human C region.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Therefore, cDNA encoding the antibody V and C regions, the method of producing the antibody according to some of the embodiments described herein involve several steps, as exemplified below: 1. isolation of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the cell line producing an anti-IGF-1R antigen antibody and from optional additional antibodies supplying heavy and light constant regions; cloning and cDNA production therefrom; 2. preparation of a full length cDNA library from purified mRNA from which the appropriate V and/or C region gene segments of the L and H chain genes can be: (i) identified with appropriate probes, (ii) sequenced, and (iii) made compatible with a C or V gene segment from another antibody for a chimeric antibody; 3. Construction of complete H or L chain coding sequences by linkage of the cloned specific V region gene segments to cloned C region gene, as described above; 4. Expression and production of L and H chains in selected hosts, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to provide murine-murine, human-murine, human-human or human murine antibodies.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Two coding DNA sequences are said to be &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; if the linkage results in a continuously translatable sequence without alteration or interruption of the triplet reading frame. A DNA coding sequence is operably linked to a gene expression element if the linkage results in the proper function of that gene expression element to result in expression of the coding sequence.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is intended to mean&#xb1;5% of the value it modifies.

The term refers to preparations where the isolated protein is sufficiently pure to be analyzed, or at least 70% to 80% (w/w) pure, at least 80%-90% (w/w) pure, 90-95% pure; and, at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% (w/w) pure. In some embodiments, the antibody is purified.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">As an alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody to a polypeptide may be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with a polypeptide described herein to thereby isolate immunoglobulin library members that bind to the polypeptide. Techniques and commercially available kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are well known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody or antigen binding protein display libraries can be found in the literature.

The chemical moiety may be, inter alia, a polymer, a radionuclide or a cytotoxic factor. In some embodiments, this can be referred to as an antibody drug conjugate. In some embodiments, the chemical moiety is a polymer which increases the half-life of the antibody molecule in the body of a subject. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., PEG with a molecular weight of 2 kDa, 5 kDa, 10 kDa, 12 kDa, 20 kDa, 30 kDa or 40 kDa), dextran and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). Lee, et al., (1999) (Bioconj. Chem. 10:973-981) discloses PEG conjugated single-chain antibodies. Wen, et al., (2001) (Bioconj. Chem. 12:545-553) disclose conjugating antibodies with PEG which is attached to a radiometal chelator (diethylenetriaminpentaacetic acid (DTPA)). Examples of chemical moieties include, but are not limited to, anti-mitotics, such as calicheamicins (e.g. ozogamicin), monomethyl auristatin E, mertansine, and the like. Other exmaples include, but are not limited to, biologically active anti-microtubule agents, alkylating agents and DNA minor groove binding agents. Other examples of are provided herein and below. The chemical moiety can be linked to the antibody through a linking group (maleimide), a cleaveble linker, such as a cathepsin cleavable linkers (valine-citrulline), and in some embodiments, one or more spacers (e.g. para-aminobenzylcarbamate). Without being bound to any particular theory, once the antibody conjugate binds IGF-1R it can be internalized and the chemical moiety can kill the cell or otherwise inhibit its growth. In some embodiments, the cell is a thyroid cell.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention may also be conjugated with labels such as <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>O, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>51</sup>Cr, <sup>57</sup>To, <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>60</sup>Co, <sup>59</sup>Fe, <sup>57</sup>Se, <sup>152</sup>Eu, <sup>67</sup>CU, <sup>217</sup>Ci, <sup>211</sup>At, <sup>212</sup>Pb, <sup>47</sup>Sc, <sup>109</sup>Pd, <sup>234</sup>Th, and <sup>40</sup>K, <sup>157</sup>Gd, <sup>55</sup>Mn, <sup>52</sup>Tr and <sup>56</sup>Fe.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The antibodies and antibody fragments may also be conjugated with fluorescent or chemilluminescent labels, including fluorophores such as rare earth chelates, fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaladehyde, fluorescamine, <sup>152</sup>Eu, dansyl, umbelliferone, luciferin, luminal label, isoluminal label, an aromatic acridinium ester label, an imidazole label, an acridimium salt label, an oxalate ester label, an aequorin label, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, biotin/avidin, spin labels and stable free radicals.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">The antibody molecules may also be conjugated to a cytotoxic factor such as diptheria toxin, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>exotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, <i>Aleurites fordii </i>proteins and compounds (e.g., fatty acids), dianthin proteins, <i>Phytoiacca americana </i>proteins PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S, <i>Momordica charantia </i>inhibitor, curcin, crotin, <i>Saponaria officinalis </i>inhibitor, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0116">Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody molecules of the invention to the various moieties may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter, et al., (1962) Nature 144:945; David, et al., (1974) Biochemistry 13:1014; Pain, et al., (1981) J.

In some embodiments, the extracellular domain of the CAR can be an antibody as provided for herein. In some embodiments, the antibody is in a scFv format. CAR-T cells are a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are modified so they will attack the cells that are expressing IGF-1R. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cells is added in the laboratory. In some embodiments, the receptor binds to IGF-1R using the binding regions of the antibodies provided for herein. The CAR-T cells comprising the IGF-1R antibody can then be used to treat a condition, such as those provided for herein.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">In some embodiments, antibodies (e.g. an anti-IGF-1R antibody) are provided herein. In some embodiments, the antibody is a recombinant antibody that binds to a IGF-1R protein. In some embodiments, the IGF-1R protein is a human IGF-1R protein. In some embodiments, the IGF-1R protein that is recognized by the antibodies is in its native conformation (non-denatured) conformation. In some embodiments, the antibody does not specifically binds to a denatured IGF-1R protein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;recombinant antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is not naturally occurring. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;recombinant antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is not isolated from a human subject.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">In some embodiments, the antibody

The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index (LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>). In particular aspects, antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are desirable. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity.

Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0184">Alternately, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0185">The administration regimen depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the therapeutic antibody, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the therapeutic antibody, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, the administration regimen delivers sufficient therapeutic antibody to effect improvement in the target disease state, while simultaneously minimizing undesired side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular therapeutic antibody and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of therapeutic antibodies is available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) <i>Antibody Therapy, </i>Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) <i>Monoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis, </i>Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.)

Med. </i>343:1594-1602).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0186">Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects.

Each component is scored as present (1 point) or absent (0 points). The score at each efficacy assessment is the sum of all items present; giving a range of 0-7, where 0 or 1 constitutes inactive disease and 7 severe active ophthalmopathy. A change of &#x3e;2 points is considered clinically meaningful.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0208">Item 1, spontaneous orbital pain could be a painful, or oppressive feeling on, or behind, the globe. This pain may be caused by the rise in intraorbital pressure, when the orbital tissues volume increases through excess synthesis of extracellular matrix, fluid accumulation, and cellular infiltration and expansion. Item 2, gaze evoked orbital pain, could be pain in the eyes when looking, or attempting to look, up, down or sideways, i.e., pain with upward, downward, or lateral eye movement, or when attempting eye movement. This kind of pain could arise from the stretching of the inflamed muscle(s), especially on attempted upgaze. The stretching pain' cannot be provoked by digital pressing on the eyeball, as would be expected if it were a manifestation of the raised intraorbital pressure. Both kinds of pain can be reduced after anti-inflammatory treatment. These kinds of pain are therefore considered to be directly related to autoimmune inflammation in the orbit and thus useful in assessing TAO activity.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0209">Swelling in TAO is seen as chemosis (edema of the conjunctiva), item no. 6 in Table 1, and swelling of the caruncle and/or plica semilunaris. Both are signs of TAO activity. Swollen eyelids can be caused by edema, fat prolapse through the orbital septum, or fibrotic degeneration.

In some embodiments, the improvement in or reduction in severity of diplopia is sustained at least 20 weeks after discontinuation of antibody administration. In some embodiments, the improvement in or reduction in severity of diplopia is sustained at least 50 weeks after discontinuation of antibody administration.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0215">The severity of the disease can be measured in the following non-limiting embodiments. For example, for lid aperture, the distance between the lid margins are measured (in mm) with the patient looking in the primary position, sitting relaxed, and with distant fixation. For swelling of the eyelids, the measure/evaluation is either &#x201c;absent/equivocal,&#x201d; &#x201c;moderate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;severe.&#x201d; Redness of the eyelids is either absent or present. Redness of the conjunctivae is either absent or present. In some embodiments, conjunctival edema is either absent or present. In some embodiments, inflammation of the caruncle or plica is either absent or present. Exophthalmos is measured in millimeter using the same Hertel exophthalmometer and same intercanthal distance for an individual patient. Subjective diplopia is scored from 0 to 3 (0=no diplopia; 1=intermittent, i.e., diplopia in primary position of gaze, when tired or when first awakening; 2=inconstant, i.e., diplopia at extremes of gaze; 3=constant, i.e., continuous diplopia in primary or reading position). For eye muscle involvement, the ductions are measured in degrees. Corneal involvement is either absent/punctate or keratopathy/ulcer. For optic nerve involvement, i.e., best-corrected visual acuity, color vision, optic disc, relative afferent pupillary defect, the condition is either absent or present. In addition, visual fields are checked if optic nerve compression is suspected. In some embodiments, the patient can be classified according to the following severity classification. For example, sight-Threatening Thyroid Eye Disease: Patients with dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) and/or corneal breakdown. This category warrants immediate intervention. Moderate-to-Severe Thyroid Eye Disease: Patients without sight-threatening disease whose eye disease have sufficient impact on daily life to justify the risks of immunosuppression (if active) or surgical intervention (if inactive). Patients with moderate-to-severe thyroid eye disease usually have any one or more of the following: lid retraction greater than or equal to 2 mm, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos greater than or equal to 3 mm above normal for race and gender, inconstant or constant diplopia. Mild Thyroid Eye Disease: Patients whose features of thyroid eye disease have only a minor impact on daily life insufficient to justify immunosuppressive or surgical treatment. They usually have only one or more of the following: minor lid retraction (&#x3c;2 mm), mild soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos&#x3c;3 mm above normal for race and gender, transient or no diplopia, and corneal exposure responsive to lubricants.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0216">In some embodiments, a patient can be characterized by Graves Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life (GO-QoL) score. In addition to proptosis (or exophthalmos) and CAS, quality of life is also evaluated with the use of the GO quality of life (GO-QoL) questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed to determine the improved quality of life after treatment with a method disclosed herein. In some embodiments, questionnaire may determine the decreased or lack of side effects after being treated with an antibody, or an antigen binding fragment thereof, according to a method disclosed herein as compared to treatment with glucocorticoids. The GO-QoL is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire divided into 2 subsets and used to assess the perceived effects of TED by the subjects on (i) their daily physical activity as it relates to visual function, and (ii) psychosocial functioning. Quality of life is evaluated with the use of the GO QoL questionnaire. The GO-QoL questionnaire [C. B. Terwee et al, 1998] is completed on Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, and 24 (or PW) during the Treatment Period, and at Months 7 and 12 (or PW) during the Follow-Up Period. The GO-QoL is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire divided into two self-assessment subscales; one covering impact of visual function on daily activities, the other assesses the impact of self-perceived appearance. The visual function subscale covers activities such as driving, walking outdoors, reading, watching television. The appearance subscale asks the subject questions such as whether ophthalmopathy has altered the subject's appearance, caused other people to have a negative reaction to the subject, caused social isolation, and caused the subject to try to mask his or her appearance. Each subscale has 8 questions which are answered with: yes&#x2014;very much so; yes&#x2014;a little; or no&#x2014;not at all. Each question is scored 0-2, respectively, and the total raw score is then mathematically transformed to a 0-100 scale, where 0 represents the most negative impact on quality of life, and 100 represents no impact. A change of &#x3e; or greater than equal to 8 points on the 0-100 scale has been shown to be clinically meaningful. The combined score takes raw scores from both subscales and again transforms them to a single 0-100 scale. The questionnaire has two self-assessment subscales. Each subscale has 8 questions which are answered with: (i) yes&#x2014;very much so; (ii) yes&#x2014;a little; or (iii) no&#x2014;not at all. Each question is scored 0-2, respectively, and the total raw score is then mathematically transformed to a 0-100 scale, where 0 represents the most negative impact on quality of life, and 100 represents no impact. A change of &#x3e;8 points on the 0-100 scale is considered to be clinically meaningful. The combined score takes raw scores from both subscales and again transforms them to a single 0-100 scale.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0217">Patients can also be assessed by the presence of absence of Gorman Grading of Diplopia. The Gorman assessment of subjective diplopia includes four categories: no diplopia (absent), diplopia when the patient is tired or awakening (intermittent), diplopia at extremes of gaze (inconstant), and continuous diplopia in the primary or reading position (constant). Patients are scored according to which grade of diplopia they are experiencing. An improvement of greater than equal or to 1 grade is considered clinically meaningful.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0218">In some embodiments, the methods comprise administering an antibody, such as those provided herein.

Unexpectedly, the yield for the antibody with the YTE mutation in the Fc domain (VRDN2700) was approximately 80% higher than the yield of a similar antibody except that it has a L/S mutation. This was surprising and unexpected as other antibodies that have been tested that target IGF-1R with the YTE or LS mutations had similar expressions regardless of the Fc mutations. The YTE version had fewer lower molecular weight species as compared to the LS version. Thus, indicating that the YTE antibody has fewer impurities and is a more homogenous composition, which provides advantages over the antibody with the LS mutation. This was also not predictable as another antibody that was evaluated showed the opposite effect on such species. Furthermore, during purification, it was found that the LS mutant formed more aggregates when being purified on a cation exchange column as compared VRDN-2700. The aggregation of the LS mutant would cause significant manufacturing issues, which were not observed for VRDN-2700.
