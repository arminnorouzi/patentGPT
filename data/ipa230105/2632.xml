Traditional analog printing typically involves the creation of a plate or a screen, i.e., an actual physical image from which ink is transferred to the textile. Both rotary and flat screen printing have great volume throughput capacity, but also have limitations on the maximum image size that can be printed. For large images, pattern repeats are used. Conversely, digital inkjet printing enables greater flexibility in the printing process, where images of any desirable size can be printed immediately from an electronic image without pattern repeats. Inkjet printers are gaining acceptance for digital textile printing. Inkjet printing is a non-impact printing method that utilizes electronic signals to control and direct droplets or a stream of ink to be deposited on media.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Features of examples of the present disclosure will become apparent by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an example multi-fluid kit and an example textile printing kit;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an example of a printing system and different examples of the printing method;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts Turn-On-Energy (TOE) curves for three example pretreatment fluids, plotting drop weight in nanograms (ng) vs. firing energy in microJoules (pJ); and</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> are black and white reproductions of originally colored photographs of comparative prints (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) generated with different comparative pretreatment fluids and example prints (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) generated with different example pretreatment fluids, illustrating an improvement in opacity for each of the example prints as compared to the comparative prints.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The textile industry is a major industry, and printing on textiles, such as cotton, polyester, etc., has been evolving to include digital printing methods. Some digital printing methods enable direct to garment (or other textile) printing. White ink is one of the most heavily used inks in direct to garment printing. More than two-thirds of the direct to garment printing that is performed utilizes a white ink on a colored textile. Obtaining white images with desirable opacity has proven to be challenging, in part because different textile fabrics introduce different obstacles that can affect the white print. As an example, cotton fabrics are more likely than polyester fabrics to have fibrillation (e.g., hair-like fibers sticking out of the fabric surface).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein is a multi-fluid kit that is particularly suitable for obtaining white images, which may have desirable opacity, durability (i.e., washfastness), and quality. Examples of the multi-fluid kit include a pretreatment fluid, a fixer fluid, and a white inkjet ink. The pretreatment fluid includes anionically modified cellulose nanocrystals, which interact with positively charged groups of a cationic polymer in the fixer fluid to form a gel. This gel forms a film that blocks pores of the textile fabric. As such, the gel film allows the pigment of the white inkjet ink to be fixed at or near the surface of the textile fabric, which improves the opacity of the white image that is formed. Moreover, the gel film may be able to hold the hair-like fibers of the cotton textile fabric, which reduces fibrillation and improves image quality.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The opacity may be measured in terms of L*, i.e., lightness, of a white print generated on a colored textile fabric. A greater L* value indicates a greater opacity of the white ink on the colored textile fabric. L* is measured in the CIELAB color space, and may be measured using any suitable color measurement instrument (such as those available from HunterLab or X-Rite). The white inkjet ink, when printed on the colored textile fabric pretreated with the pretreatment fluid and the fixer fluid disclosed herein, may generate prints that have a desirable L* value.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The durability of a print on a textile fabric may be assessed by its ability to retain color after being exposed to washing. This is also known as washfastness. Washfastness can be measured in terms of a change in L* before and after washing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The fluid(s) and/or white inkjet ink disclosed herein may include different components with different acid numbers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;acid number&#x201d; refers to the mass of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in milligrams that is used to neutralize one (1) gram of a particular substance. The test for determining the acid number of a particular substance may vary, depending on the substance. For example, to determine the acid number of a polyurethane-based binder, a known amount of a sample of the binder may be dispersed in water and the aqueous dispersion may be titrated with a polyelectrolyte titrant of a known concentration. In this example, a current detector for colloidal charge measurement may be used. An example of a current detector is the MUtek PCD-05 Smart Particle Charge Detector (available from BTG). The current detector measures colloidal substances in an aqueous sample by detecting the streaming potential as the sample is titrated with the polyelectrolyte titrant to the point of zero charge. An example of a suitable polyelectrolyte titrant is poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (i.e., PolyDADMAC). It is to be understood that any suitable test for a particular component may be used.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Throughout this disclosure, a weight percentage that is referred to as &#x201c;wt % active&#x201d; refers to the loading of an active component of a dispersion or other formulation that is present in the pretreatment fluid, the fixer fluid, or the white inkjet ink. For example, the white pigment may be present in a water-based formulation (e.g., a stock solution or dispersion) before being incorporated into the white inkjet ink. In this example, the wt % actives of the white pigment accounts for the loading (as a weight percent) of the white pigment that is present in the white inkjet ink, and does not account for the weight of the other components (e.g., water, etc.) that are present in the formulation with the white pigment. The term &#x201c;wt %,&#x201d; without the term actives, refers to the loading (in the pretreatment fluid, the fixer fluid, or the white inkjet ink) of a 100% active component that does not include other non-active components therein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;molecular weight&#x201d; as used herein refers to weight average molecular weight (Mw), the units of which are g/mol or Daltons.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The viscosity measurements set forth herein represent those measured by a viscometer at a particular temperature and at a particular shear rate (s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) or at a particular speed. The temperature and shear rate or temperature and speed are identified with individual values. Viscosity may be measured, for example, by a VISCOLITE&#x2122; viscometer (from Hydromotion) or another suitable instrument.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; may mean that one component or material is positioned directly on another component or material. When one is directly on another, the two are in contact with each other. For example, the fixer fluid may be applied on the textile fabric so that it is directly on and in contact with the textile fabric.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other examples, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; may mean that one component or material is positioned indirectly on another component or material. By indirectly on, it is meant that an additional component or material may be positioned between the two components or materials. For example, the pretreatment fluid may be applied on the fixer fluid which has been applied on the textile fabric, and thus the pretreatment fluid may be considered to be on, or in indirect contact with, the textile fabric.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Sets and Kits</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Examples of the multi-fluid kit disclosed herein are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

As a result of acid hydrolysis and esterification, a fraction of the hydroxy (&#x2014;OH) groups of natural cellulose are esterified by the acid, which incorporates anionic carboxylate (&#x2014;O&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) or sulfonate (&#x2014;O&#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) groups on the surface of the nanocrystals.

Mixture 1), a strong gel was formed. When PT3 was mixed with an acid (Comp. Mixture 2) or the fixer fluid was mixed with a base (Comp. Mixture 5), no gel was formed. These results indicated that gel formation was not due to pH shock. Additionally, no gel was formed when the fixer fluid was mixed with the anionic polymer (Comp. Mixture 6). Loose and weak gels were formed when PT3 was mixed with the comparative cationic dispersion (Comp. Mixtures 3 and 4). When the fixer fluid was mixed with the comparative pretreatment fluids, PT4 or PT5, no gel was formed.

The example pretreatment fluids were printed using a thermal inkjet printer. The jettability performance was evaluated using a Turn-On Energy (TOE) curve. The term &#x201c;Turn-On Energy (TOE) curve,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the drop weight of the pretreatment fluid as a function of firing energy. A pretreatment fluid with good jettability performance also has a good TOE curve, where the fluid drop weight rapidly increases (with increased firing energy) to reach a designed drop weight for the pen architecture used; and then a steady drop weight is maintained when the firing energy exceeds the TOE. In other words, a sharp TOE curve may be correlated with good jettability performance. In contrast, a pretreatment fluid with a poor TOE curve may show a slow increase in drop weight (with increased firing energy) and/or may never reach the designed drop weight for the pen architecture. A poor TOE curve may be correlated with poor jettability performance. The TOE curves for the example pretreatment fluids, PT1, PT2, PT3, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As depicted, each of the example pretreatment fluids exhibited a good TOE curve, indicating good jettability via thermal inkjet printheads.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0187">Prints were then generated using one or more of: the example or comparative example pretreatment fluids, the fixer fluid, and the white inkjet ink.
