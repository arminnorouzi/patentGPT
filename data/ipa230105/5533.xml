As such, other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications. Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures, or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as&#x201d; &#x201c;a&#x201d;,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for the existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material onto which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself can be patterned. Materials added on top of the substrate can be patterned or can remain unpatterned. Furthermore, the substrate can include a wide array of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, etc. Alternatively, the substrate can be made from an electrically non-conductive material, such as a glass, a plastic, or a sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductor and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or via contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each DRAM cell includes a transistor and a capacitor within an integrated circuit, and a data bit is stored in the capacitor. Since transistors always leak a small amount of charge, the capacitors will slowly discharge, causing information stored in them to drain. As such, DRAM has to be refreshed to retain data. The advantages of DRAM are its simple design and low cost in comparison to alternative types of memory. Also, DRAM can achieve a 10 ns read and write speed. However, DRAM may also lose data easily due to charge leakage in DRAM cells.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A PCM can utilize the difference between the resistivity of the amorphous and the crystalline phase in phase-change materials (e.g., chalcogenide alloys) based on heating and quenching of the phase-change materials electrothermally. The phase-change material in a PCM cell can be located between two electrodes, and electrical currents can be applied to switch the material (or at least a fraction of it that blocks the current path) repeatedly between the two phases to store data. By changing the resistance rapidly, PCM can achieve a faster read and write speed than that of DRAM up to a 10 ns to 100 ns read and write speed. However, the performance of PCM cells is largely influenced by the elemental compositions. Different alloys may have distinctly different physical and electrical properties in terms of crystallization speed, thermal stability, switching power, and resistance contrast. A conventional approach to defining the low resistance state (e.g., ON state) as memory state &#x201c;1&#x201d; and the high resistance state (e.g., OFF state) as memory state &#x201c;0&#x201d; of a memory device may not be able to fulfill the need in defining the 1 or 0 state of PCM cells due to the high cell-to-cell variation. For example, the first memory state &#x201c;0&#x201d; can correspond to the first range of voltages, and the second memory state &#x201c;1&#x201d; can correspond to the second range of voltages. However, in the case of PCM, the range of voltages may not be easily defined because the resistance of the PCM cell may be fluctuant, and the range of voltages may be wide. Therefore, other approaches to defining the multiple memory states of a memory cell may be helpful, especially for PCM cells.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, in a cost-benefit sensitive market like solid-state drive (SSD), the pursuit of cheaper and larger SSD products has pushed the industries to store more bits on a single cell. In general, the number of bits stored on a cell determines the type of memory used. A single-level cell (SLC) memory contains one bit per cell. Multi-level cell (MLC) doubles the capacity with two bits per cell. Triple-level cell (TLC) contains three bits per cell, while quad-level cell (QLC) contains four bits per cell, allowing for four times the capacity of SLC memory. While it is not that more bits saved on a single cell equal better memory product due to other write performance issues and endurance challenges, it is generally better to have multiple approaches to realize multiple states in a single memory cell to increase the potential and flexibility of the products.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Last, among other memory devices, PCM has faced data retention challenges due to its thermal stability between the amorphous and the crystalline phase. A failed PCM cell may not be able to write back to the 0 state represented by the high-resistance state and may be read into 1 state represented by the low-resistance state, which causes data error. These error bits may need to be identified before the problem becomes catastrophic.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces a novel architecture of PCM memory devices. Each memory cell of the PCM memory device can include N PCM elements, N selectors, and N word lines (N is a positive integer greater than 1, e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.) arranged in a differential architecture, which can allow higher speed, high accuracy read and write operations, as well as the instant determination of any device failure. The number of data bits that can be stored in each memory cell can be increased, for example, from MLC to QLC, as well due to the differential architecture. In some implementations, each one of the memory cells further includes an SRAM for output data comparison and high-speed data cache.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary system SRAM <b>100</b> having a memory device, according to some aspects of the present disclosure.

Each memory cell <b>306</b> may include, for example, two PCM elements and two respective selectors and thus may store two bits in a single memory cell <b>306</b>. Furthermore, two voltage signals across the two PCM elements and two respective selectors may be compared via the comparator circuit (e.g., <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to output a bit (either 1 or 0) to be stored as memory bits, thereby providing multiple ways to store data in a single cell. By combining different methods of storing data, an MLC, TLC, or QLC design can be achieved. Furthermore, the two voltage signals across the two PCM elements and two respective selectors may also be used to determine whether one of the two PCM elements is failed, thereby correct the error bit.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">One way to determine whether there is erroneous reading is to compare the present resistance (by applying a read signal) of the PCM element with reference resistances of such PCM element (e.g., reference resistances of a high resistance state and a low resistance state). If a difference (e.g., it can be either voltage difference or current difference) between high resistance and the present resistance and another difference between low resistance and the present resistance are switched from positive to negative or from negative to positive, the PCM element is well-functioned. In contrast, if a difference between high resistance and the present resistance and another difference between low resistance and the present resistance are not switched from positive to negative or from negative to positive, the PCM element is failed due to its failure to switch between high resistance state and low resistance state. However, this method cannot be accurate if there is an occurrence of resistance-drift. The resistance-drift will make the determination wrong since the PCM element may not be failed but just change to higher resistance or a lower resistance in both high resistance state and low resistance state.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another way to determine whether there is erroneous reading precisely is to reduce the inference of the resistance-drift. In PCM devices, the amorphous or high resistance states are not entirely stable. Melt-quenched amorphous regions created inside the chalcogenide layer undergo structural relaxations and thus the resistance of the PCM device tends to increase with time which is known as the resistance-drift, which leads to a higher risk of erroneous reading. The erroneous reading can be defined, by comparing a reference resistance value of the PCM element, with a present resistance value of the PCM element (or their corresponding voltage value). For example, a reference resistance may be defined as a crystalline state (e.g., represented as &#x201c;1&#x201d;), and a present resistance of the PCM element, though in a crystalline state, may have a much higher resistance value than the reference resistance value due to the resistance-drift. As such, the present resistance of the PCM element is misread out as an amorphous state rather than a crystalline state which leads to the erroneous reading. Although the resistance-drift may cause erroneous reading, two PCM elements operated at the same time may have the same tendency to the resistance-drift. For instance, the two PCM elements may increase their corresponding resistances in the same proportion. Therefore, when determining whether one of the two PCM elements is failed, a voltage difference between two PCM elements can be used to determine whether one of them is failed and at the same time, offset the inference of resistance-drift.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">PCM elements <b>3081</b> and <b>3082</b> can utilize the difference between the resistivity of the amorphous and the crystalline phase in phase-change materials based on heating and quenching of the phase-change materials electrothermally. Electrical currents can be applied to switch the phase-change material (or at least a fraction of it that blocks the current path) of PCM elements <b>3081</b> and <b>3082</b> repeatedly between the two phases to store data. Two bits of data can be stored in each memory cell <b>306</b> and can be written or read by varying the voltage applied to respective selectors <b>3101</b> and <b>3102</b>, which eliminates the need for transistors. During operations, the set and reset state of the PCM element refers to the low and high-resistance states, respectively. After fabrication, the phase change material is in the crystalline, low-resistance state because the processing temperature of the conductive metal layers (e.g., electrodes or bit lines) is sufficient to crystallize the phase change material. To reset the PCM element into the amorphous phase, the programming region is first melted and then quenched rapidly by applying a large electrical current pulse for a short time period. Doing so leaves a region of amorphous, highly resistive material in the PCM element. This amorphous region is in series with any crystalline region of the PCM element and effectively determines the resistance of the PCM element between the top electrode and the bottom electrode. To set the PCM element into the crystalline phase, a medium electrical current pulse is applied to anneal the programming region at a temperature between the crystallization temperature and the melting temperature for a time period long enough to crystallize. To read the state of the programming region, the resistance of the PCM element is measured by passing an electrical current small enough not to disturb the current state. It is noted that, in some implementations, each one of selectors <b>3101</b> and <b>3102</b> can be replaced by a transistor, a diode, or any other devices that can be used to switch On and OFF the PCM element.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The materials of PCM elements <b>3081</b>, <b>3082</b> include chalcogenide-based composition, including chalcogenide-based alloys and chalcogenide-based glass), such as GST (Ge&#x2014;Sb&#x2014;Te) alloy, or any other suitable phase-change materials, according to some implementations.

Electrical currents can be applied to switch the phase-change material (or at least a fraction of it that blocks the current path) of common PCM element <b>308</b> repeatedly between the two phases to store data. After fabrication, the phase change material of common PCM element <b>308</b> can be programmed in the crystalline, low-resistance state because the processing temperature of the conductive metal layers (e.g., electrodes or bit lines) is sufficient to crystallize the phase change material. To reset the PCM element into the amorphous phase, a programming region (e.g., an area where PCM element <b>308</b> contacts first contact region <b>3131</b> or second contact region <b>3132</b>) is first melted and then quenched rapidly by applying a large electrical current pulse for a short time period. Doing so leaves a region of amorphous, highly resistive material in the PCM element. This amorphous region is in series with any crystalline region of the PCM element and effectively determines the resistance of the PCM element between the top electrode and the bottom electrode. To set the PCM element into the crystalline phase, a medium electrical current pulse is applied to anneal the programming region at a temperature between the crystallization temperature and the melting temperature for a time period long enough to crystallize. To read the state of the programming region, the resistance of the PCM element is measured by passing an electrical current small enough not to disturb the current state.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, PCM memory device <b>350</b> can further include one or more heaters <b>3151</b> and <b>3152</b> coupled between first bottom electrode <b>3141</b> and common PCM element <b>308</b> in first contact region <b>3131</b>, and second bottom electrode <b>3142</b> and common PCM element <b>308</b> in second contact region <b>3132</b>, respectively.

In a conventional 1 selector (heater), 1 PCM element architecture, once the PCM element is failed to switch between a crystalline phase and amorphous phase, there is no other way to repair it. On the contrary, by using common PCM element <b>308</b> with two selectors (and heaters), once a first contact region (e.g., <b>3131</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) of PCM element <b>308</b> is failed, another well-functioned heater (e.g., second heater <b>3142</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) can generate more heat by applying a higher voltage across and transmit the heat from a second contact region (e.g., <b>3132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) of PCM element <b>308</b> to the first contact region to reactivate or repair the failed part (e.g., first contact region <b>3131</b>) of PCM element <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Last but not the least, common PCM element <b>308</b> can provide a better chip size reduction. In particular, since common PCM element <b>308</b> is formed as a layer or a bulk rather than a piece of PCM element, the resistance states of common PCM element <b>308</b> can be divided into more states.
