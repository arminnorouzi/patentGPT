field of electrolyte compositions for rechargeable lithium-ion electrochemical cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Rechargeable lithium-ion type electrochemical cells are known in the prior art. As a result of their high bulk energy density and energy density for a given volume, they are a promising electric power source. They comprise at least one cathode (positive electrode), the active material of which is generally a lithiated oxide of at least one transition metal or a lithiated phosphate of at least one transition metal, and at least one anode (negative electrode), the active material of which may be graphite-based. Such cells nevertheless have a limited lifetime when used in cycling at a temperature above room temperature, typically between 25&#xb0; C. and 85&#xb0; C. The loss of capacity of such cells can reach 20% of their initial capacity after about 100 cycles of charge/discharge carried out at 85&#xb0; C. At such a temperature, the constituents of the cell rapidly degrade leading to either short-circuiting of the cell or an increase in its internal resistance. In addition, the electrolyte heats up, tends to decompose into gas, resulting in an increase in the pressure inside the container of the cell. If this increase in pressure is not controlled, it may lead to a rupture of the container of the cell, thereby exposing the electrode plate group to ambient air and an irreversible failure of the cell.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is therefore sought to provide novel lithium-ion electrochemical cells having improved lifetime when used in cycling at a temperature above room temperature, i.e. ranging from about 20-25&#xb0; C. to 85&#xb0; C. It is considered that this objective is achieved when cells are capable of operating under cycling conditions by performing at least 200 cycles with a discharge depth of 100% without a loss of capacity of more than 20% of their initial capacity being observed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to improving the service life of the lithium-ion electrochemical cells, it is desirable that such cells can operate under cycling conditions in such a temperature range without the risk of their container breaking open.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various documents disclose electrochemical cells of the lithium-ion type that overcome these drawbacks:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">European patent application, publication No. 3,195,388 discloses an electrolyte composition for a lithium-ion electrochemical cell.

Each cycle consists of charging at a rate of C/3 up to a voltage of 4.3 V, followed by a discharge at a rate of C/3 down to a voltage of 2.7 V. Allowable capacity loss is set to be 20% of the initial capacity. It is materialized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by a horizontal line at the ordinate 0.8.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0160">It is found that the replacement of EC and EMC by F1EC and F3EMC makes it possible to increase the service life of the cell because at the 250th cycle, the capacity of cell B represents about 87% of its initial value while that of cell A is only about 77% of its initial value. Nevertheless, failure of cell B due to its container breaking open was encountered at cycle 260. This is explained by the high reactivity of the graphite anode as regards F1EC. F1EC gets reduced with generation of a large amount of gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) that causes the container to break open. By increasing the LiPF<sub>6 </sub>salt concentration to 2 mol&#xb7;L<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in cell C, the number of molecules of F1EC solvating lithium ions is reduced. This reduces the amount of reduction of the F1EC molecules at the anode and the amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>generated. Cell C has a capacity retention very close to that of cell B, without however undergoing breaking open of its container beyond the 250<sup>th </sup>cycle. Swelling of the container of cell C is less than that of cell A (+16.9% for cell C with respect to +23% for cell A after 100 cycles at 25&#xb0; C. and 100 cycles at 60&#xb0; C.).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0161">b) Effect of the Presence of Hexafluoromethoxypropane (HFMP) in the Electrolyte of Cells</p><p id="p-0118" num="0162">The cycling performance of cells E, F, G the electrolyte of which contains HFMP was compared to that of cell D the electrolyte of which does not contain it. Each cycle consists of a charge at a rate of C/3 up to a voltage of 4.3 V, followed by a discharge at a rate of C/3 down to a voltage of 2.7 V. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the variation in the capacity of cells D to G expressed as a percentage of their initial capacity during cycling at a temperature of 60&#xb0; C. It is found that cells E, F and G the electrolyte of which contains HFMP have a lifetime greater than that of cell D. Cell E failed at the 136<sup>th </sup>cycle due to its container breaking open. The Applicant assumes that the presence of HFMP contributes to increasing the service life of cells E, F and G but it can cause an excessive concentration of F1EC at the anode and generate a large amount of gas by decomposition of F1EC at the anode. In order to prevent the formation of an excessively large passivation layer and the generation of gas, it is possible to add LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>to the electrolyte and/or to replace F3EMC by F3A. This is demonstrated by the results obtained with cells F and G. The container of cells F and G remains sealed right up until the end of cycling. This is explained by the presence of LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>in composition F and by the presence of trifluoroethyl acetate (F3EA) in composition G. The presence of trifluoroethyl acetate (F3EA) makes it possible to decrease the solvation number of F1EC and thus to limit the reducing reaction of F1EC at the anode, even in the absence of LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the variation in coulombic efficiency of cells D to G under the same cycling conditions as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The coulombic efficiency of cells E, F and G whose electrolyte contains HFMP is higher than that of cell D whose electrolyte does not contain it.

However, cell D, which is not part of the present invention had poor capacity retention while cells G and F according to the invention showed good capacity retention.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0165">c) Electrochemical Capacity Induced by the Reducing Reaction of Compounds of the Solvent During Charging of the Cell</p><p id="p-0122" num="0166">Cell formation was carried out on cells A, B, C and E at a temperature of 60&#xb0; C., at a rate of C/10 up to a voltage of 4.3 V. A passivation layer (SEI) is formed at the anode during this formation. This layer results from the reduction of certain chemical species from the solvent at the anode. The electrochemical capacity induced by the reaction of these species was measured. It is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for a cell voltage ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 V It can be noted by comparison between the curve obtained for cell E and those obtained with cells B and C that the presence of HFMP in the electrolyte increases the magnitude of the reduction peak for F1EC. The value of the measured electrochemical capacity peak for cell E is about 450 mAh&#xb7;V<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>while it is only about 290 mAh&#xb7;V<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>for cell B and about 320 mAh&#xb7;V<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>for cell C. Since a larger amount of F1EC surrounds the lithium ions in the case of a ternary electrolyte according to the invention, this larger amount of F1EC is brought into contact with the interface of the anode to be reduced there and contribute to the growth of the passivation layer.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0167">d) Influence of the Composition of the Solvent of the Electrolyte on the Increase in Temperature of the Cell During its First Charge.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the increase in the temperature of the outer wall of the container of cells B, E, F and G during the formation of the passivation layer (SEI) during the first charging of these cells. The increase in temperature is shown for different values of the F1EC solvation number. This increase in temperature is proportional to the amount of energy released during the F1EC exothermic reduction reaction at the anode. Cell E is the one whose electrolyte composition reacts the most with the anode and thus leads to the highest temperature rise (+9.5%). The thickest passivation layer is that obtained for cell E. The addition of 0.1% by weight of LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>mitigates the formation of the passivation layer (SEI), therefore the temperature rise of the cell and the formation of gas in the container. This is demonstrated by cell F for which the temperature increase is no more than +8.5% instead of +9.5%. Replacing F3EMC with F3EA (composition G) has the effect of reducing the temperature rise of the cell. The latter is no more than 6%. This suggests that the presence of F3EA reduces the number of F1EC molecules around the lithium ions, and thus the reactivity of F1EC at the anode. Composition B which does not contain HFMP, and therefore does not change the solvation number of F1EC leads to a low temperature rise of about +4%. As a comparison, the observed temperature rise for the cell containing the non-fluorinated composition is about 7.5%.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0169">e) Highlighting the Reduction of F1EC Reactivity and Limiting of the Growth of the Passivation Layer Thanks to the Presence of LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>:</p><p id="p-0126" num="0170">Two button format cells comprising a cathode based on LiNi<sub>0,6</sub>Co<sub>0,2</sub>Mn<sub>0,2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, an anode comprising graphite and 1.55% by weight of silicon oxide were manufactured and filled with one of 40 &#x3bc;L of the electrolyte composition E, the other with the same volume of the electrolyte composition F. A first charge was carried out at a temperature of 60&#xb0; C. on cells E and F, at a rate of C/10 up to a voltage of 4.2 V. A passivation layer (SEI) is formed at the anode during the first charge. This results from the reduction at the anode of certain chemical species of the solvent. The electrochemical capacity induced by this reduction reaction was measured during this first charge. It is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> for a voltage of between 1.5 and 3.2 V. The magnitude of the F1EC reduction peak in electrolyte F is significantly lower than that of the reduction peak of F1EC in electrolyte E This indicates that F1EC in composition F is less reactive than in composition E. This decrease in the magnitude of the reduction peak can be attributed to the presence of 0.1% by weight of LiPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>in composition F.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230006257A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
