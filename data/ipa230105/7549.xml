These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some examples, a UE may add or change serving cells.

For example, a UE may use a conditional PSCell procedure (such as conditional PSCell add or change (CPAC) procedure) to add a PSCell or to change a PSCell. The UE may be configured with the conditional PSCell procedure and may perform (or attempt to perform) the conditional PSCell procedure when a set of triggering conditions for the conditional PSCell procedure is satisfied. However, the wireless communications system may not support communication of information related to the conditional PSCell procedure, which may negatively impact the performance of the wireless communications system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the techniques described herein, a UE may report information related to a conditional procedure for adding a PSCell or changing PSCells. The reported information can be used by the network to enhance the conditional PSCell addition or change procedures.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, the information reported by the UE may also include or indicate the coexistence of primary Cell (PCell) and PSCell procedures at the UE, which may refer to the types of serving cell procedures configured at the UE. For example, the UE may be configured with a configuration for a handover procedure (e.g., a legacy handover, a conditional handover, or a Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover) for a PCell in addition to being configured with the configuration for the conditional PSCell procedure. Additionally or alternatively, the information reported by the UE may be based on the triggering order for the serving cell procedures. For example, the UE may report different information depending on whether the conditional PSCell procedure or the handover procedure is triggered first. Additionally or alternatively, the information reported by the UE may be based on a failure or success status of the serving cell(s) (e.g., PCell and PSCell) procedure(s), the connection status of the serving cell(s) (PCell and PSCell), or both, among other factors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Aspects of the disclosure are further described in the context of process flows. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to reporting for conditional primary secondary cell addition or change.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports reporting for conditional primary secondary cell addition or change in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or a New Radio (NR) network. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The base stations <b>105</b> may be dispersed throughout a geographic area to form the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. The base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may wirelessly communicate via one or more communication links <b>125</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide a coverage area <b>110</b> over which the UEs <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may establish one or more communication links <b>125</b>.

The UEs <b>115</b> may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. Some example UEs <b>115</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b>, the base stations <b>105</b>, or network equipment (e.g., core network nodes, relay devices, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, or other network equipment), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b>, or with one another, or both. For example, the base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through one or more backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over the backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>), or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>), or both. In some examples, the backhaul links <b>120</b> may be or include one or more wireless links.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">One or more of the base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by a person having ordinary skill in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or a giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or other suitable terminology.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A UE <b>115</b> may include or may be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client, among other examples. A UE <b>115</b> may also include or may be referred to as a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may include or be referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or a machine type communications (MTC) device, among other examples, which may be implemented in various objects such as appliances, or vehicles, meters, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> that may sometimes act as relays as well as the base stations <b>105</b> and the network equipment including macro eNBs or gNBs, small cell eNBs or gNBs, or relay base stations, among other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with one another via one or more communication links <b>125</b> over one or more carriers. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and &#x394;<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to IP services <b>150</b> for one or more network operators. The IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally or alternatively, an antenna panel may support radio frequency beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with one or more configurations for one or more serving cell procedures.

Unlike a configuration for a non-conditional procedure for adding or changing the PSCell, the configuration for the conditional PSCell procedure may be sent before communication conditions degrade at the PSCell. Rather than applying the configuration for the conditional PSCell procedure right away (which the UE <b>215</b> may do for a configuration for a non-conditional PSCell procedure), the UE <b>215</b> may store the configuration and wait to apply the configuration until one or more triggering conditions associated with the conditional PSCell procedure are satisfied.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some examples, the master node <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>may also send the UE <b>215</b> a configuration for a handover procedure for handing over (e.g., changing) the PCell (e.g., from a source master node to a target master node).
