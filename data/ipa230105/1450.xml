id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vibration structure, a vibration device using the vibration structure, and a tactile presentation device using the vibration device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A touchscreen, which is an input device that operates equipment by a user pressing display on a screen, may include a tactile presentation device that, by transmitting vibration when the user presses the touchscreen, gives the user a tactile sense of pressing the touchscreen. Examples of vibration structure for generating vibration in a tactile presentation device include a vibration structure described in International Publication No. 2019/013164 (hereinafter &#x201c;Patent Document 1&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vibration structure described in Patent Document 1 includes a film (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;piezoelectric member&#x201d;) that deforms in a planar direction in response to voltage application, a vibration member including a frame part, a vibration part, and a support part, and a connection member. In the vibration member, the frame part has an opening, and a part of a piezoelectric member is connected. The vibration part is disposed inside the opening, another part of the piezoelectric member is connected to the vibration part, and the piezoelectric member deforms in the planar direction to vibrate in the planar direction. The support part supports the vibration part to the frame part. The connection member connects the piezoelectric member and the frame part, and connects the piezoelectric member and the vibration part.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the vibration structure described in Patent Document 1, a part of the piezoelectric member and the frame part are connected so as to overlap each other. That is, when a tactile presentation device incorporated with the vibration structure receives impact, tensile stress is likely to be generated in the piezoelectric member due to the impact. Therefore, there is a possibility that the piezoelectric member is damaged, and the tactile presentation device will not operate normally. In particular, when a piezoelectric ceramic, which is likely to be damaged by impact, is used as a piezoelectric member, or when a resin piezoelectric film is used but fixed in a state where tensile stress is intrinsic, and the piezoelectric member is liable to be damaged by generation of the tensile stress due to impact, this problem becomes remarkable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vibration structure configured to suppress damage of a piezoelectric member when receiving impact, and a vibration device and a tactile presentation device using the vibration structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an exemplary aspect, a vibration structure is provided that includes a vibration member including a frame, a vibrator, and a support, a piezoelectric member, a first connection member, and a second connection member. The frame has a first opening. The vibrator is disposed inside the first opening and has a second opening. The support supports the vibrator to the frame. The piezoelectric member is disposed inside the second opening, has a first end and a second end, and expands and contracts in a first direction connecting the first end and the second end when voltage is applied. The first connection member connects the first end of the piezoelectric member and the frame. The second connection member connects the second end of the piezoelectric member and the vibrator. At least the first connection member is an elastic body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another exemplary aspect, a vibration device is provided that includes the vibration structure described herein and a drive circuit configured to apply voltage to the piezoelectric member included in the vibration structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, in an exemplary aspect, a tactile presentation device is provided that includes the vibration device described herein and a pressure detector that detects pressure on the vibrator included in the vibration structure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The vibration structure according to the present invention can, by elastic deformation of the first connection member, which is an elastic body, suppress the generation of tensile stress in the piezoelectric member when receiving impact. Therefore, damage of the piezoelectric member can also be prevented when receiving impact. Since the vibration device disclosed herein uses the vibration structure, failure can also be suppressed when receiving impact. Furthermore, since the tactile presentation device uses the vibration device as disclosed herein, the user can be provided a tactile sense also after receiving impact. When this device is used as a device for removing and conveying a droplet, powder, and the like, it is similarly possible to maintain its function after receiving impact.</p><?summary-of-invention

The first connection member <b>3</b> includes the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and a second part <b>3</b><i>b</i>. The second connection member <b>4</b> includes the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>and a second part <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The vibration member <b>1</b> includes a frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>(or simply a &#x201c;frame&#x201d;), the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>(or simply a &#x201c;vibrator&#x201d;), and support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>(or simply &#x201c;supports&#x201d;). The vibration structure <b>100</b> is connected to a circuit or a device that applies voltage to the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>, such as a drive circuit <b>200</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(A)</figref>) described later, with the voltage application member <b>5</b> interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown, the vibration member <b>1</b> has a first main surface and a second main surface facing back-to-back the first main surface. The frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the vibration member <b>1</b> has a first opening A<b>1</b>. The vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is a plate-shaped member having a rectangular main part and having protrusions on opposing short sides, and is disposed inside the first opening A<b>1</b>. The vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is formed with a rectangular second opening A<b>2</b> having a long axis along an expansion and contraction direction of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> described later in a plan view. The second opening A<b>2</b> is in communication with the first opening A<b>1</b>. The support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>each have a strip shape extending in a direction (second direction D<b>2</b> described later) orthogonal to the expansion and contraction direction of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> described below, and each supports the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>to the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>by connecting the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the vibration structure <b>100</b>, the frame part <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>of the vibration member <b>1</b> are formed of the identical member. As a material of the vibration member <b>1</b>, a fiber-reinforced plastic material can be used, for example, such as an acrylic resin, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, or a glass epoxy composite material, metal, glass, or the like. In a case where metal is used, stainless steel, a tungsten alloy, a titanium alloy, or the like is preferable. A board material for circuit wiring may also be used. In this case, the part related to the electric wiring can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">That is, the frame part <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>can be formed by punching one rectangular plate member such that these sites remain. In this case, the frame part <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>can be easily formed. Furthermore, when punching is performed with the identical member, it is easy to match the natural vibration periods of the plurality of support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f</i>. Therefore, vibration variation can be reduced when the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is vibrated.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, in the exemplary aspects of the present disclosure, the frame part <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>do not need to be formed of the identical member, and may be different members. For example, when the plurality of support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>are of different members, the vibration state of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be adjusted by changing the material of each support part from the material of the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b</i>. For example, use of a material, such as rubber, for the support parts <b>1</b><i>c </i>to <b>1</b><i>f </i>facilitates an increase of the vibration of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>while reducing the voltage applied to the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> includes a piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a </i>having a prismatic shape, a first electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided on a first main surface of the piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and a second electrode <b>2</b><i>c </i>on a second main surface facing back-to-back to the first main surface, and has a first end and a second end (see FIG. <b>1</b>(B)). The piezoelectric member <b>2</b> is disposed inside the second opening A<b>2</b>, and expands and contracts in a first direction D<b>1</b> connecting the first end and the second end when voltage is applied between the electrodes. As mentioned earlier, the first direction D<b>1</b>, which is the expansion and contraction direction of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>, is parallel to the long axis of the rectangular second opening A<b>2</b>. As a material of the piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a piezoelectric ceramic material can be used that exhibits a large inverse piezoelectric effect, for example, such as lead zirconate titanate and lead-free piezoelectric ceramics such as niobium piezoelectric ceramics. In this case, the vibration of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be increased.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The voltage is applied between the electrodes of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> in the vibration structure <b>100</b> from the voltage application member <b>5</b> described later with the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> interposed therebetween. However, the voltage may be applied from the voltage application member <b>5</b> not by the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> but another wiring interposed therebetween. The voltage may be applied not by the voltage application member <b>5</b>, but another wiring and the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> interposed therebetween. Furthermore, the voltage may be applied not by the voltage application member <b>5</b> and the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b>, but another wiring interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, it is noted that in the exemplary aspects of the present disclosure, the piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a </i>does not need to have a prismatic shape, and may have a columnar shape other than a prismatic shape, such as a cylindrical shape, or may have a plate shape or a film shape. For example, when the piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a </i>has a plate shape or a film shape, a resin piezoelectric film, such as polyvinylidene fluoride, poly-L-lactic acid, and poly-D-lactic acid can be used as a material of the piezoelectric element <b>2</b><i>a</i>. When the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> is the resin piezoelectric film as described above, it is preferably connected to each connection member described later in a state where tensile stress is intrinsic, that is, in a state where tension is applied. However, it is not essential that the tensile stress is intrinsic in the resin piezoelectric film, and it may be connected to each connection member so that the tensile stress is generated only when the resin piezoelectric film contracts.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As further illustrated, the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> is connected to the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the vibration member <b>1</b> by the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b>, and is connected to the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the vibration member <b>1</b> by the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b>. Each part of the first connection member <b>3</b> and the second connection member <b>4</b> has a strip shape extending along the first direction D<b>1</b>, which is the expansion and contraction direction of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> is an elastic body, and connects the first end of the first electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided on the first main surface of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> and the first main surface of the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>with the voltage application member <b>5</b> interposed therebetween. As mentioned earlier, the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> can be a voltage supply path to the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> and the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> are also elastic bodies similar to the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b>. The second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> connects the first end of the second electrode <b>2</b><i>c </i>provided on the second main surface of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> and the second main surface of the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>while facing the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> with the voltage application member <b>5</b> interposed therebetween. The second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> can also be a voltage supply path to the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> connects the second end of the first electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided on the first main surface of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> and the first main surface of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>with a fixing member <b>6</b><i>a </i>interposed therebetween. The second part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> connects the second end of the second electrode <b>2</b><i>c </i>provided on the second main surface of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> and the second main surface of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>while facing the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> with a fixing member <b>6</b><i>b </i>not illustrated interposed therebetween. In another exemplary aspect, the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> may connect the second end of the first electrode <b>2</b><i>b </i>and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>without the fixing member <b>6</b><i>a </i>interposed therebetween. Moreover, the second part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> may connect the second end of the second electrode <b>2</b><i>c </i>and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>without the fixing member <b>6</b><i>b </i>interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a material of the first connection member <b>3</b> and the second connection member <b>4</b>, a copolymer synthetic resin can be used, for example, of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyamideimide, metal, or the like. In a case of focusing on the material, it is possible to select, from them, one having a Young's modulus smaller than that of the vibration member <b>1</b> or the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>. However, as described later, the first connection member <b>3</b> and the second connection member <b>4</b> can function as elastic bodies due to their structures even when the Young's modulus is larger than that of the vibration member <b>1</b> or the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>. Therefore, the magnitude relationship of the Young's modulus is not an essential condition in the exemplary aspect. When the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> are voltage supply paths to the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>, a wiring material such as copper is further included in addition to the above. As the elastic body, a stretchable material may be used, or a stretchable structural member such as a spring may be used.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the exemplary aspect, the voltage application member <b>5</b> is an L-shaped flexible cable having a first main surface and a second main surface, and having a part extending along the second direction D<b>2</b> orthogonal to the first direction D<b>1</b> and a part extending along the first direction D<b>1</b> in a plan view. The voltage application member <b>5</b> includes a cable body <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a first electrode <b>5</b><i>b </i>provided in a part extending along the second direction D<b>2</b> on the first main surface side of the cable body <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and a second electrode <b>5</b><i>c </i>provided in a part extending along the first direction D<b>1</b> on the first main surface side.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first electrode <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the voltage application member <b>5</b> is connected to the wiring of the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b>. By the part extending along the first direction D<b>1</b> being bent, the second electrode <b>5</b><i>c </i>of the voltage application member <b>5</b> is connected to the wiring of the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> opposing the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> with the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>interposed therebetween. However, as mentioned earlier, the voltage may be applied between the electrodes of the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> from the voltage application member <b>5</b> with another wiring interposed therebetween without the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the fixing member <b>6</b><i>a </i>that fixes the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the fixing member <b>6</b><i>b </i>not illustrated that fixes the second part <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>have strip shapes extending along the second direction D<b>2</b> in the plan view. As a material of each fixing member, a material such as metal, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyamideimide, or a copolymer synthetic resin of acrylonitrile, butadiene, and styrene, can be used, for example. When each fixing member itself has adhesiveness, each fixing member and each constituent member are directly adhered. When each fixing member itself does not have adhesiveness, they may be bonded with an adhesive or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(A)</figref> is a plan view of the vibration structure <b>100</b> in a state before receiving impact. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(B)</figref> is a plan view of the vibration structure <b>100</b> in a state of receiving impact along a first direction D<b>1</b> so that a vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is displaced in an orientation from a first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b> toward a first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(C)</figref> is a plan view of the vibration structure <b>100</b> in a state of receiving impact along a first direction D<b>1</b> so that a vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>is displaced in an orientation from the first part <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the second connection member <b>4</b> toward the first part <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the first connection member <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is assumed that the vibration structure <b>100</b> receives impact by which the state becomes from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(A)</figref> to the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>(B)</figref>. In the exemplary embodiment, the piezoelectric member <b>2</b> is connected to the frame part <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>with each connection member that is an elastic body interposed therebetween. Therefore, each connection member extends in the plan view from the initial state with respect to displacement of the vibration part <b>1</b><i>b </i>due to impact, so that a change in the relative positional relationship can be suppressed between the vibration member <b>1</b> and the piezoelectric member <b>2</b>.
