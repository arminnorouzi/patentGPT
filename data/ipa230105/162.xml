They may be imitation, synthetic or natural ingredients or blends thereof. They may be in any suitable form, for example, oil, liquid, gel, powder, or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Induction heating is a process in which an electrically-conductive object is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. The process is described by Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law. An induction heater may comprise an electromagnet and a device for passing a varying electrical current, such as an alternating current, through the electromagnet. When the electromagnet and the object to be heated are suitably relatively positioned so that the resultant varying magnetic field produced by the electromagnet penetrates the object, one or more eddy currents are generated inside the object. The object has a resistance to the flow of electrical currents. Therefore, when such eddy currents are generated in the object, their flow against the electrical resistance of the object causes the object to be heated. This process is called Joule, ohmic, or resistive heating. An object that is capable of being inductively heated is known as a susceptor.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It has been found that, when the susceptor is in the form of a closed circuit, magnetic coupling between the susceptor and the electromagnet in use is enhanced, which results in greater or improved Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Magnetic hysteresis heating is a process in which an object made of a magnetic material is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. A magnetic material can be considered to comprise many atomic-scale magnets, or magnetic dipoles. When a magnetic field penetrates such material, the magnetic dipoles align with the magnetic field. Therefore, when a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field, for example as produced by an electromagnet, penetrates the magnetic material, the orientation of the magnetic dipoles changes with the varying applied magnetic field. Such magnetic dipole reorientation causes heat to be generated in the magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When an object is both electrically-conductive and magnetic, penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field can cause both Joule heating and magnetic hysteresis heating in the object. Moreover, the use of magnetic material can strengthen the magnetic field, which can intensify the Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In each of the above processes, as heat is generated inside the object itself, rather than by an external heat source by heat conduction, a rapid temperature rise in the object and more uniform heat distribution can be achieved, particularly through selection of suitable object material and geometry, and suitable varying magnetic field magnitude and orientation relative to the object. Moreover, as induction heating and magnetic hysteresis heating do not require a physical connection to be provided between the source of the varying magnetic field and the object, design freedom and control over the heating profile may be greater, and cost may be lower.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a schematic view of an example of a magnetic field generator <b>120</b> of apparatus for heating smokable material to volatilize at least one component of the smokable material, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments, the coil <b>140</b> may be wound around only a portion (i.e. not all) of the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> preferably has high magnetic permeability and low electrical conductivity. The latter helps prevent the generation of eddy currents in the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> in use, which helps to prevent the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> becoming heated in use.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In each of the embodiments described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> comprises, or is composed of, ferrite. The ferrite may, for example, contain iron oxide combined with nickel and/or zinc and/or manganese. The ferrite may have a low coercivity and be considered a &#x201c;soft ferrite&#x201d;, or have a high coercivity and be considered a &#x201c;hard ferrite&#x201d;. Example usable soft ferrites are manganese-zinc ferrite, with the formula Mn<sub>a</sub>Zn<sub>(1-a)</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and nickel-zinc ferrite, with the formula Ni<sub>a</sub>Zn<sub>(1-a)</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. However, in respective variations to these embodiments, the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> may be made of a different material or materials. For example, in some embodiments, the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> may comprise plural layers of electrically-conductive material that are isolated from one another by non-electrically-conductive material. The magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> may have dozens, or even hundreds, of layers of electrically-conductive material that are isolated from one another by non-electrically-conductive material.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, the device <b>160</b> for passing a varying current through the coil <b>140</b> is electrically connected between the electrical power source <b>130</b> and the coil <b>140</b>. In this embodiment, the controller <b>170</b> also is electrically connected to the electrical power source <b>130</b>, and is communicatively connected to the device <b>160</b> to control the device <b>160</b>. More specifically, in this embodiment, the controller <b>170</b> is for controlling the device <b>160</b>, so as to control the supply of electrical power from the electrical power source <b>130</b> to the coil <b>140</b>. In this embodiment, the controller <b>170</b> comprises an integrated circuit (IC), such as an IC on a printed circuit board (PCB). In other embodiments, the controller <b>170</b> may take a different form. In some embodiments, the apparatus may have a single electrical or electronic component comprising the device <b>160</b> and the controller <b>170</b>. The controller <b>170</b> is operated in this embodiment by user-operation of the user interface <b>180</b>. The user interface <b>180</b> may be located at the exterior of the apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> into which the magnetic field generator <b>120</b> is incorporated. The user interface <b>180</b> may comprise a push-button, a toggle switch, a dial, a touchscreen, or the like. In other embodiments, the user interface <b>180</b> may be remote and connected to the rest of the apparatus wirelessly, such as via Bluetooth.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, operation of the user interface <b>180</b> by a user causes the controller <b>170</b> to cause the device <b>160</b> to cause an alternating electrical current to pass through the coil <b>140</b>, so as to cause the coil <b>140</b> to generate an alternating magnetic field. In the embodiments described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, when the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is located in the heating zone <b>110</b>, the coil <b>140</b> and the heater <b>20</b> of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are suitably relatively positioned so that the alternating magnetic field produced by the coil <b>140</b> penetrates the heating material of the heater <b>20</b> of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. As further described herein, the magnetically permeable core <b>150</b> helps to direct the magnetic field so that the magnetic field penetrates the heating material of the heater <b>20</b> of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. When the heating material of the heater <b>20</b> of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is an electrically-conductive material, this may cause the generation of one or more eddy currents in the heating material. The flow of eddy currents in the heating material against the electrical resistance of the heating material causes the heating material to be heated by Joule heating. As mentioned above, when the heating material is made of a magnetic material, the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the heating material changes with the changing applied magnetic field, which causes heat to be generated in the heating material.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, the temperature sensor <b>190</b> is for sensing a temperature of the heating zone <b>110</b> in use. The temperature sensor <b>190</b> is communicatively connected to the controller <b>170</b>, so that the controller <b>170</b> is able to monitor the temperature of the heating zone <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the temperature sensor <b>190</b> may be arranged to take an optical temperature measurement of the heating zone <b>110</b> or article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. In some embodiments, the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> may comprise a temperature detector, such as a resistance temperature detector (RTD), for detecting a temperature of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> may further comprise one or more terminals connected, such as electrically-connected, to the temperature detector. The terminal(s) may be for making connection, such as electrical connection, with a temperature monitor of the magnetic field generator when the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is in the heating zone <b>111</b>. The controller <b>170</b> may comprise the temperature monitor. The temperature monitor of the apparatus <b>100</b> may thus be able to determine a temperature of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> during use of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> with the apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, by providing that the heating material of the heater <b>20</b> of the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> has a suitable resistance, the response of the heating material to a change in temperature could be sufficient to give information regarding temperature inside the article <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The temperature sensor <b>190</b> may then comprise a probe for analyzing the heating material.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the basis of one or more signals received from the temperature sensor <b>190</b> or temperature detector, the controller <b>170</b> may cause the device <b>160</b> to adjust a characteristic of the varying or alternating electrical current passed through the coil <b>140</b> as necessary, in order to ensure that the temperature of the heating zone <b>110</b> remains within a predetermined temperature range.
