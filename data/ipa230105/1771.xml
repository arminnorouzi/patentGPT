Examples of the sensor mounted on the automobile include a camera, Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), a millimetric wave radar, an infrared sensor, or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Infrared rays are classified into near-infrared (for example, a wavelength of 0.7 &#x3bc;m to 2 &#x3bc;m), mid-infrared (for example, a wavelength of 3 &#x3bc;m to 5 &#x3bc;m), and far-infrared (for example, a wavelength of 8 &#x3bc;m to 13 &#x3bc;m) depending on a wavelength band thereof. Examples of the infrared sensor for detecting such infrared rays include a touch sensor, a near-infrared camera, or a LiDAR for near-infrared, gas analysis or mid-infrared spectroscopic analysis (functional group analysis) for mid-infrared, night vision or a thermo-viewer (hereinafter, referred to as a far-infrared camera) for far-infrared, and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normally, window glass of an automobile does not transmit far-infrared rays having a wavelength from 8 &#x3bc;m to 13 &#x3bc;m, so that a far-infrared camera is conventionally installed outside a compartment, more specifically, on a front grill in many cases as in Patent Literature 1, for example. However, in a case of installing the far-infrared camera outside the compartment, a structure becomes more complicated to secure ruggedness, water resistance, dustproof properties, and the like, which results in high cost. By installing the far-infrared camera within the compartment, specifically, in an operation area of wipers, the far-infrared camera is protected by the window glass, and dirt or the like can be wiped off, so that the problem as described above can be solved. However, as described above, there is the problem that the window glass does not transmit far-infrared rays, so that the far-infrared camera has not been disposed within the compartment normally.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To meet the demand described above, Patent Literature 2 discloses a window member in which a through hole is made on part of the window glass and an infrared-ray transmissive member is filled in the through hole.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Literature 1: U.S. Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003/0169491</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Literature 2: U.K. Patent Application Laid-open No. 2271139</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a case of making a through hole on window glass and filling the through hole with an infrared-ray transmissive member as in Patent Literature 2, a frame member having a sealing property may be interposed between the through hole of the window glass and the infrared-ray transmissive member for the purpose of shock resistance, soil resistance, sound insulation, protection for a bonding agent from an external environment, and the like. However, in a case of disposing the frame member, the frame member may project from a surface on a vehicle exterior side of the window glass. In a case in which the frame member projects from the surface on the vehicle exterior side of the window glass, a wiping property of the wipers for the window glass may be deteriorated, or a load on the wipers may be increased.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is made in view of such a situation, and an object thereof is to provide glass for vehicles, a frame member, and a manufacturing method for the glass for vehicles that can suppress deterioration in the wiping property of the wipers and increase in the load on the wipers.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To solve the problem above, a glass for vehicle of the present disclosure comprises a glass base body and including a light blocking region, wherein a far-infrared ray transmission region is formed in the light blocking region, the far-infrared ray transmission region being provided with an opening formed on the glass base body and a far-infrared ray transmission member disposed in the opening, the glass base body and the far-infrared ray transmission member are bonded to each other with a frame member interposed therebetween, and, regarding the frame member, where a length of a longest straight line among straight lines each connecting optional two points on an inner circumference on a side facing the opening in a surface on a vehicle exterior side is D, and a thickness of a portion projecting from a surface on a vehicle exterior side of the glass base body is t, D<sup>2</sup>/t is larger than 1250 and t is equal to or smaller than 2.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To solve the problem above, a frame member of the present disclosure is configured to bond a far-infrared ray transmission member disposed in an opening formed on a glass base body of glass for vehicles to the glass base body, the frame member comprises a first holding part;

The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that a frame member <b>30</b>A is constituted of a plurality of members.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a frame member according to the second embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the frame member <b>30</b>A according to the second embodiment includes a first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> and a second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b>. The first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> and the second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b> are O-rings in this example. The first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> is disposed between an outer peripheral surface of the far-infrared ray transmission member <b>20</b> and an inner peripheral surface of the opening <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the glass base body <b>12</b>. The first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> is filled between the outer peripheral surface of the far-infrared ray transmission member <b>20</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the glass base body <b>12</b> to seal between the outer peripheral surface of the far-infrared ray transmission member <b>20</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the glass base body <b>12</b>. That is, it can be said that the first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> has the function of the first holding part <b>31</b> in the first embodiment. The first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> projects toward the vehicle exterior side from between the outer peripheral surface of the far-infrared ray transmission member <b>20</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the glass base body <b>12</b>, and covers a boundary between the far-infrared ray transmission member <b>20</b> and the glass base body <b>12</b> on the surface on the vehicle exterior side of the glass <b>1</b> for vehicles. That is, it can be said that the first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> also has the function of the first flange part <b>34</b> in addition to the function of the first holding part <b>31</b> in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">The second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b> is disposed on an inner peripheral surface of the glass base body <b>14</b>. The second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b> seals a space between the glass base body <b>12</b> and the glass base body <b>14</b>, that is, a space on a radially inward of the intermediate layer <b>16</b>. That is, it can be said that the second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b> has the function of the second holding part <b>32</b> in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">The frame member <b>30</b>A may also be constituted of three or more members. For example, in a case in which the frame member <b>30</b>A is constituted of three members, the frame member <b>30</b> may have a configuration in which an O-ring is interposed between the first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> and the second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b>. In this case, the O-ring may also have the function of the second holding part <b>32</b> in the first embodiment. In this case, the O-ring is required to have a water cut-off property, so that a material of the O-ring is preferably a rubber material, or a composite material of a synthetic resin and rubber. A material of the first frame member <b>30</b>A<b>1</b> and the second frame member <b>30</b>A<b>2</b> may be a synthetic resin material having ultraviolet ray resistance described above, a rubber material, a composite material thereof, or a metallic material such as stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">By using the frame member <b>30</b>A constituted of a plurality of members as described above, it is possible to suppress deterioration in the wiping property of the wipers and increase in the load on the wipers.
