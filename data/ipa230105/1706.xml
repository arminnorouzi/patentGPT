The tape printer creates a base label and clear overlay labels by printing objects on tape using an ink ribbon. The overlay labels are then affixed to the base label to create a composite label. The editing device is used to edit print data for creating the composite label.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, objects printed on an overlay label often do not span the entire label, such as when the objects are spaced apart from each other. Such cases lead to a waste of tape when the overlay label, created based on print data edited on the editing device, has the same approximate size as the base label.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide an editing device that can edit print data according to an intended purpose.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to attain the above and other objects, the present disclosure provides an editing device including a controller. The controller is configured to perform: (a) editing; and (b) displaying. The (a) editing edits print data for creating a composite label with a printer. A tape cassette is attachable to the printer. The tape cassette accommodates therein a tape and an ink ribbon. The tape extends in a longitudinal direction and has a tape width in a width direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction. The ink ribbon has an ink color. The printer is configured to perform a single printing operation using the ink ribbon to print an object on the tape in a single printing color thereby creating a single label. The single printing color is identical to the ink color of the ink ribbon. The composite label has a plurality of labels including a base label and at least one overlay label. The composite label is created by affixing the at least one overlay label to the base label. The (a) editing includes: (a1) acquiring; (a2) determining; (a3) acquiring; (a4) categorizing; (a5) setting; and (a6) setting. The (a1) acquiring acquires a plurality of pieces of object data corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of objects. The plurality of pieces of object data represents respective ones of a plurality of object images. Each of the plurality of object images is rendered in the single printing color. The print data is created using the plurality of pieces of object data. The (a2) determining determines a printing color of a target object. The target object is selected one by one from among the plurality of objects. The (a3) acquiring acquires tape information on a target tape cassette to be used for printing the target object with the printer. The target tape cassette accommodates therein a target tape and a target ink ribbon. The target ink ribbon has the ink color identical to the printing color of the target object. The tape information of the target tape includes width information and opacity information. The tape information indicates the tape width of the target tape. The opacity information indicates whether the target tape is opaque. The (a4) categorizing categorizes the target object to one of a base object and an overlay object according to the printing color of the target object and the tape information of the target tape. The plurality of objects is respectively categorized to a single base object and at least one overlay object. The (a5) setting sets, in response to categorizing the target object to the overlay object, a target tape length and a target tape orientation. The target tape length is a length in the longitudinal direction of the target tape used for creating the overlay label. The (a6) setting sets a print mode to one of a shortest length mode and a fewest prints mode. In the shortest length mode, a single overlay label is created for each overlay object. In the fewest prints mode, a single overlay label is created for all overlay objects each of which has a same printing color. The (b) displaying displays a composite label image of the composite label based on the print data on a display.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The particular features and advantages of the disclosure as well as other objects will become apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a printing system including a tape printer and an editing device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating creation of a composite label, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a base label and three overlay labels, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates the composite label created when the three overlay labels are affixed to the base label;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electrical configuration of the printing system including the tape printer and the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps in a main process executed by a CPU in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating a full editing screen displayed on a display unit in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the full editing screen and a layer editing screen superimposed thereon displayed on the display unit in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a part of steps in a composite label editing process executed by the CPU in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating another part of steps in the composite label editing process executed by the CPU in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating remaining part of steps in the composite label editing process executed by the CPU in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the full editing screen, and the layer editing screen and a warning icon superimposed thereon displayed on the display unit in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the full editing screen, and the layer editing screen and a confirmation screen superimposed thereon displayed on the display unit in the editing device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps in a printing process executed by the CPU in the editing device of the embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating a print preview displayed on the display unit of the editing device before the printer performs printing operation; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram illustrating the print preview displayed on the display unit of the editing device while the printer performs printing operation.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A printing system <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure will be described while referring to the accompanying drawings.

Labels in the present embodiment are categorized as base labels <b>41</b> and overlay labels <b>42</b>. A composite label <b>49</b> is created by affixing overlay labels <b>42</b> to the printing surface of a base label <b>41</b>. Thus, the base label <b>41</b> serves as the base, or bottom, of the composite label <b>49</b>. Hereinafter, the tape <b>40</b> used for creating the base label <b>41</b> will be called the &#x201c;base tape.&#x201d; In other words, the base label <b>41</b> is created by cutting the base tape after objects have been printed thereon. The tape <b>40</b> used for creating the overlay label <b>42</b> will be called the &#x201c;overlay tape.&#x201d; In other words, the overlay labels <b>42</b> are created by cutting the overlay tape after objects have been printed thereon. The tape <b>40</b> is categorized as base tape and overlay tape according to the tape attributes.

Standard cassette information is cassette information for a standard cassette. When mounted cassette information for a single mounted cassette was acquired in the mounted cassette information acquiring process of S<b>11</b>, the standard cassette denotes the tape cassette <b>30</b> corresponding to the acquired mounted cassette information (i.e., the mounted cassette). When mounted cassette information for a plurality of mounted cassettes was acquired in the mounted cassette information acquiring process of S<b>11</b>, the standard cassette denotes a default tape cassette <b>30</b>. The default tape cassette <b>30</b> is a cassette provided with a black ink ribbon and a white non-clear tape having a tape width of 24 mm. If no mounted cassette information was acquired in the mounted cassette information acquiring process of S<b>11</b>, the standard cassette information represents the default tape cassette <b>30</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the information &#x201c;24 mm BLACK/WHITE&#x201d; is displayed in the standard cassette information indicator <b>68</b>.

For example, if an object is added, an image of the object is added to the composite label image <b>66</b>. The object image renders the added object in the color specified by the color indicator. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a case in which the black text T<b>1</b> was added as an object to be printed on the base tape (hereinafter called a &#x201c;base object&#x201d;).

Here, the user can perform operations in the full editing screen <b>271</b> using the input unit <b>26</b> to edit the print data. Specifically, as described above, the user can edit print data by: selecting a print mode; adding and deleting objects; and changing the shapes, positions, sizes, and printing colors of objects. The print modes include a shortest length mode, and a fewest prints mode. While these will be described later in greater detail, the shortest length mode controls the tape printer <b>10</b> to create an overlay label <b>42</b> for each object, while the fewest prints mode controls the tape printer <b>10</b> to create an overlay label <b>42</b> for all objects having the same printing color. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the shortest length mode is set as the print mode at the start of the editing process. In the editing operations receiving process of S<b>13</b>, the CPU <b>21</b> receives editing operations for print data through the input unit <b>26</b>. The CPU <b>21</b> stores various types of information corresponding to the editing operations received for print data in the RAM <b>24</b>. This information includes information specifying the print mode, and information related to objects.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In S<b>14</b> the CPU <b>21</b> reflects the changes made to the print data in the full editing screen <b>271</b>. For example, when the black text T<b>1</b> is added as a base object as described above, the CPU <b>21</b> adds the object image <b>662</b> to the composite label image <b>66</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In S<b>15</b> the CPU <b>21</b> determines whether an overlay object exists on the basis of the information that was stored in the RAM <b>24</b> in the editing operations receiving process of S<b>13</b>. An overlay object is any object printed on overlay tape and has a printing color that differs from the printing color of the base object. In the present embodiment, when the standard cassette has non-clear tape as a tape attribute, the CPU <b>21</b> determines that any object with a printing color different from the printing color of the standard cassette is an overlay object. If the standard cassette has clear tape as a tape attribute, the CPU <b>21</b> determines that any object having the same printing color as the printing color of the standard cassette is an overlay object. When the standard cassette has non-clear tape as the tape attribute and the printing color of the standard cassette is black as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the CPU <b>21</b> determines that there are no overlay objects if there are no objects with a printing color other than black (S<b>15</b>: NO). In this case, the CPU <b>21</b> returns to S<b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the blue text T<b>2</b> is added to the print data in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, in S<b>14</b> an object image <b>663</b> is added to the composite label image <b>66</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Since the standard cassette has the tape attribute non-clear tape and the printing color of the added text (blue) differs from the printing color of the standard cassette (black), the CPU <b>21</b> determines in S<b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that an overlay object exists (S<b>15</b>: YES). In this case, in S<b>16</b> the CPU <b>21</b> creates a base layer and a normal layer. In S<b>16</b> the CPU <b>21</b> categorizes the layer corresponding to the base object as the base layer and the layer corresponding to the overlay object as the normal layer, and stores these layers in the RAM <b>24</b>. In other words, the CPU <b>21</b> assigns the objects to one of the base tape (base layer) and overlay tape (normal layer).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In S<b>17</b> the CPU <b>21</b> displays a layer editing screen <b>272</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) on the display unit <b>27</b> based on the base layer and normal layers created in S<b>16</b>. At this time, the layer editing screen <b>272</b> is superimposed on the full editing screen <b>271</b>.

In this example, the blue text T<b>2</b> was added to the display illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Accordingly, layer screens <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are provided in the layer editing screen <b>272</b>. The layer screen <b>72</b> corresponds to the base layer, and the layer screen <b>73</b> to a normal layer <b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the layer screen that corresponds to the base label <b>41</b> (the base layer) is displayed in the topmost position among the plurality of layer screens. Layer screens corresponding to overlay labels <b>42</b> (normal layers) are displayed in descending order below the layer screen corresponding to the base label <b>41</b> according to the order that the overlay labels <b>42</b> are affixed to the base label <b>41</b>. In this way, the editing device <b>20</b> can reduce the possibility that the user will mistake the order in which overlay labels <b>42</b> are affixed to the base label <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A label display area <b>81</b> is provided in the left portion of each of the layer screens <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>.

The base label border <b>89</b> is a dashed line that indicates the outer shape of the base label <b>41</b>. The position of the label image relative to the base label border <b>89</b> corresponds to the position at which the overlay label <b>42</b> will be affixed to the base label <b>41</b>. Hence, the user can readily comprehend the position at which the overlay label <b>42</b> is affixed to the base label <b>41</b> on the basis of the position of the label image relative to the base label border <b>89</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An operating area <b>82</b> is provided in the right portion of each of the layer screens <b>72</b> and <b>73</b>.

The layer name (base layer, normal layer <b>1</b>, etc.) is displayed in each layer name indicator <b>91</b>. Thus, by checking the layer name indicator <b>91</b>, the user can distinguish the base layer from the normal layers. The label length is displayed in the label length indicator <b>92</b>. Label length indicates the longitudinal dimension of the label. By operating the label length indicator <b>92</b> using the input unit <b>26</b>, the user can adjust the label length.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The selected cassette is displayed in each selected cassette information indicator <b>93</b>. The selected cassette is the tape cassette <b>30</b> that the user selects from a plurality of candidate tape cassettes <b>30</b> by operating the selected cassette information indicator <b>93</b>. The selected cassette information is cassette information corresponding to the selected cassette. The selected cassette is the tape cassette <b>30</b> that will be used for printing.

Each time the user adds an object having a printing color that differs from the printing colors of all previously added objects (hereinafter called &#x201c;objects of a new printing color&#x201d;), the CPU <b>21</b> creates a new layer for the objects of the new printing color.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In S<b>64</b> that CPU <b>21</b> performs a process to determine the orientation (orientation determining process). In this description, &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; denotes the direction in which the tape <b>40</b> is arranged relative to the displayed object image. Orientations include a parallel orientation and an orthogonal orientation. The parallel orientation is an orientation in which the left-right direction of the object image displayed on the display unit <b>27</b> is aligned with the longitudinal direction of the tape <b>40</b>. The orthogonal orientation is an orientation in which the left-right direction of the object image displayed on the display unit <b>27</b> is aligned with the width direction of the tape <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the orientation determining process of S<b>64</b>, the CPU <b>21</b> determines whether the overlay object can be printed within a printing area on the overlay tape using the selected cassette when the orientation is the parallel orientation and when the orientation is the orthogonal orientation. If the overlay object can be printed within the printing area of the overlay tape, the CPU <b>21</b> determines whether the created overlay label <b>42</b> will run off the base label <b>41</b> when affixed thereto. In the following description, the expression &#x201c;printing acceptable&#x201d; will be used for cases in which the overlay object can be printed within the printing area on the overlay tape and when the overlay label <b>42</b> will not extend off the base label <b>41</b> when the overlay label <b>42</b> is created and affixed to the base label <b>41</b>. If printing is not acceptable, i.e., if the overlay object cannot be printed within the printing area on the overlay tape, or if the overlay object can be printed within the printing area but the overlay label <b>42</b> will extend off the base label <b>41</b> when the overlay label <b>42</b> is created and affixed to the base label <b>41</b>, the term &#x201c;printing unacceptable&#x201d; will be used for such cases. When printing is acceptable, the CPU <b>21</b> calculates the shortest length in the longitudinal direction of the overlay label <b>42</b>. In other words, when printing is acceptable, the CPU <b>21</b> calculates the length of the overlay tape required for printing the overlay object in the printing area of the overlay tape.

By selecting the shortest length mode, the user can create an overlay label <b>42</b> for each object, thereby reducing the quantity of overlay tape consumed for printing. When selecting the fewest prints mode, the user can create an overlay label <b>42</b> for each set of objects having the same printing color. In this way, if a plurality of objects has the same printing color, all objects with the same printing color can be printed at one time. Accordingly, when the fewest prints mode has been selected, printing can be performed quickly, as fewer prints are required than in the shortest length mode. The user can switch modes according to the intended purpose.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Objects are assigned to one of the base layer (base tape) and normal layer (overlay tape) according to the tape attributes and printing color acquired in S<b>11</b> for the mounted cassette, and the printing color acquired in S<b>13</b> or S<b>21</b>.

In this way, the editing device <b>20</b> eliminates the user's need to combine layer screens.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the shortest length mode has been set, layers are separated by object, and a layer screen corresponding to each of the separated layers is displayed on the display unit <b>27</b>.

Thus, the user can easily recognize the positions of overlay labels <b>42</b> relative to the base label <b>41</b> when creating a composite label <b>49</b> with overlay labels <b>42</b> to be affixed to the base label <b>41</b>. Accordingly, the editing device <b>20</b> can reduce the possibility of overlay labels <b>42</b> being affixed to the base label <b>41</b> at unsuitable positions when the user creates a composite label <b>49</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the print preview <b>274</b>, label images for layers whose print data has already been outputted to the tape printer <b>10</b> are displayed in a manner that differentiates them from label images corresponding to layers whose print data has not yet been outputted to the tape printer <b>10</b>.

For example, the present embodiment describes an example in which print data is newly generated and edited, but print data already in the process of editing may be read from the flash memory <b>22</b> to be further edited. If the print data under edit includes overlay objects in this case, the editing device <b>20</b> may display the full editing screen <b>271</b> and layer editing screen <b>272</b> on the display unit <b>27</b> based on the print data under edit.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the print preview <b>274</b> according to the present embodiment described above, label images are displayed in the order that the overlay labels <b>42</b> are to be affixed to the base label <b>41</b>.

The order of layers corresponds to the order in which the overlay labels <b>42</b> are affixed to the base label <b>41</b>. Depending on whether the order between a base layer and a normal layer was changed or the order among normal layers was changed, the processes performed afterward differ. Specifically, if the order of a base layer and a normal layer was changed, changes could also occur to the selected cassette, orientation, label length, base label border <b>89</b>, and the like for each of all layers. In such a case, the CPU <b>21</b> performs the process beginning from S<b>61</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for all layers. If the order among normal layers is changed, the CPU <b>21</b> simply changes the display positions of the layer screens.
