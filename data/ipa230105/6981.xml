Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Internet of Things (IoT) allows devices of all types, from thermostats to refrigerators to connect to the Internet and report status, receive instructions, and generally provide features and services to users that were previously unavailable in an unconnected device. However, many of these connected devices do not have trusted zones that safely store cryptographic secrets used for one-way or mutual authentication, encrypting or decrypting documents, and signing or signature verification of documents, among others. The lack of security puts many potential communication-related uses of a device at risk of eavesdropping, identity theft, or fraud. Even if the IoT device has trusted zone capability, an owner or operator may choose to not provision the IoT device. This may be done in order to prevent unintended exposure of personal data in the case of a hacking attempt or to prevent undesired communications from being made, such as online purchase transactions. In either case, these real or enforced limitations prevent the IoT device from adequately performing one or more functions that may desirable at some point to an owner or operator of the IoT device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Connected devices include hundreds of millions of cell phones and now additional millions, if not billions, of automobiles, electric meters, kitchen appliances, watches, and other wearable devices, devices often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). Often, these devices lack secure storage that can be used to store cryptographic secrets or may have other limitations that make secure communications difficult or impossible. In other cases, even if such a device is capable of supporting a cryptographically secure environment, there may be reasons to not fully provision the device for such activity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These IoT or &#x201c;origin&#x201d; devices may use a nearby enabler device with such a cryptographically secure environment as an intermediary for the origin device when these higher order tasks are being attempted, such as securely reporting status or for placing an order for goods or services. For example, the enabler device may be provisioned with cryptographic capabilities and cryptographic secrets that support secure communications from a home monitoring system, home appliance, automobile, etc. In this manner, the enabler device may be used to support secure communications for any number of different IoT devices without requiring trusted zones, cryptographic secrets, or token provisioning in each individual IoT device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The figures depict a preferred embodiment for purposes of illustration only.

The enabler device is expected to be physically near enough to use a short-range communication protocol such as Bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, or similar protocols. In some embodiments, a personal identification number (PIN) may be required to be entered in both the origin and enabler devices in order to help ensure proximity of the devices, among other purposes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As discussed above, an origin device may require secure communication with a downstream party, for example, when a communication involves information that potentially exposes personal or financial data. When the origin device is unable to provide the required level of security or functionality for any reason, the origin device may advertise for the services of an enabler device to provide the required level of secure communication services to complete the required communication.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inability to support secure communications may be an inherent limitation of the origin device, such as a lack of secure storage for key matter, may be due to limited resources, such as memory, computational power, or user interface. In other cases, it may simply be because the owner/operator of the device chooses not to provision the origin device with such a capability.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a representative environment supporting a system <b>100</b> comprising an origin device <b>102</b> and an enabler device <b>112</b> for supporting secure communication between the origin device <b>102</b> and an end point, such as a web server <b>106</b>. The origin device <b>102</b> may be one of several exemplary origin devices that may use the enabler device <b>112</b> in the manner described including a laptop <b>108</b> and an automobile <b>110</b>. While it is possible, or even likely, that the laptop <b>108</b> is capable of hosting a secure communication session, such as a secure file transfer or a purchase transaction, there may be reasons why a user of the laptop <b>108</b> may not want to use that capability. For example, if the laptop <b>108</b> is owned by an employer, the user may not wish to provision the laptop <b>108</b> with his or her credentials. In another embodiment, the laptop <b>108</b> may be shared among many users and an account holder may wish to prevent unauthorized purchases that might be made if financial instruments were to be provisioned into the laptop <b>108</b>. Similarly, the automobile <b>110</b> may be used by many operators, all of whom may not be authorized to make purchases or report usage data.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An enabler device <b>112</b> may be directly accessible to the origin devices <b>102</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> via wireless network <b>114</b>. In many cases, the wireless network <b>114</b> may be a WiFi network following an IEEE 802.11 standard. As discussed below, some device's ability to use different aspects of WiFi simultaneously presents certain advantages for the process described herein, but other networks such as Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), Zigbee, or even wired connections are capable of supporting communication between an origin device <b>102</b> and an enabler device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> are also capable of communication beyond the local environment via networks <b>104</b> and <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the networks <b>104</b> and <b>116</b> may be the same network connection. For example, in a home environment, both the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> may connect via wireless network <b>114</b> to a wireless router (not depicted) that gives each device <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> access to a wide area network <b>104</b>, such as the Internet. In other embodiments, the origin device <b>102</b> may connect to the network <b>104</b> via the wireless router while the enabler device <b>112</b> may connect via a wide area wireless network <b>116</b> such as a 4G cellular data network. The enabler device <b>112</b> connection to a financial platform, for example, a token service provider <b>118</b> is discussed below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The origin device <b>102</b> may connect to a web server <b>106</b> in the course of its normal operation. The origin device <b>102</b> may send reports regarding its own operational status, routine maintenance or repair needs, or other relatively non-sensitive data. For example, a refrigerator may report temperature or an automobile may report the need for an oil change, either of which may not be considered particularly sensitive.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, other data, such as how many times a refrigerator door has been opened, over time, may indicate when a home is not occupied. Similarly, a history of temperatures from an automated thermostat may be used to determine when a residence is typically unoccupied. When uploading this kind of data for analysis, additional security may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Purchase transactions are another communication type that may benefit from use of the enabler device <b>112</b>. While a refrigerator that can analyze its contents and automatically place orders may be a great convenience, provisioning a kitchen appliance with its own financial payment instruments may be undesirable or simply inconvenient.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In these cases, the use of an enabler device <b>112</b> fills a dual role. The enabler device <b>112</b> provides the resources for secure communication to the origin device <b>102</b>. The enabler device <b>112</b> also helps to ensure that an authorized person, or at least a person with physical access to the origin device <b>102</b>, is aware of the intended communication. Further, in the case of financial transactions, the authorized person is using his or her own financial instrument provisioned on the enabler device <b>112</b> to complete the transaction, thus avoiding a concern about someone other than the financial instrument owner but who has access to the origin device <b>102</b> from making unauthorized purchases. This may be especially true in the case of an automobile <b>110</b>, where a stolen car that is provisioned with a financial instrument for making purchases could increase the overall loss associated with such an incident.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A block diagram of an origin device <b>102</b> configured in accordance with the current disclosure is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The origin device <b>102</b> may be any of a number of devices, such as devices considered under the general classification of IoT devices. The origin device <b>102</b> may include a processor <b>130</b> and memory <b>132</b>. The memory <b>132</b> may be a combination of volatile and non-volatile physical memory but does not include storage via carrier wave or propagated media. The memory <b>132</b> may contain both an operating system (OS)/utilities <b>134</b> and executable code <b>136</b>. The OS and utilities <b>134</b> may support the basic operation of the origin device <b>102</b> including file access, diagnostics, communication support, start up, shut down, etc. The executable code <b>136</b> may include a functional application <b>140</b> that includes various routines and data used to control some or all the functions of the origin device <b>102</b>. This code <b>140</b> may be specific to that particular device. For example, in an automobile <b>110</b>, the executable code <b>136</b> may be generally responsible for operation of an entertainment system or an engine control system. In a refrigerator, the functional application <b>140</b> may be responsible for maintaining refrigerator and freezer temperatures, automatic defrost cycles, open door monitoring, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The memory <b>132</b> may also include a transaction enabler (TE) application <b>138</b>, which in some embodiments, represents a redesign of an existing device, even an existing IoT device, to provide functions supporting discovery, handshaking, PIN management, and channel setup between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b>. The TE application <b>138</b> may be used to manage the origin-side functions associated with using an enabler device <b>112</b> to handle secure communications. These functions are discussed in more detail below but may include, without limitation, wireless discovery, PIN management, and local key derivation. In an embodiment, the TE application <b>138</b>, or a function of the OS/utilities <b>134</b> may provide for certain cryptographic functions, such as software encryption/decryption and local session key derivation. Since these functions, at least as described below, are local and temporal, for example, for use in encrypting communication between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> that do not contain sensitive personal data, the need for high levels of security are reduced compared to communication over a wide area network <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The origin device may include a user interface (UI) <b>142</b>. In one embodiment, the UI <b>142</b> may have a display <b>144</b> and a keypad or keyboard <b>146</b>. In another embodiment, the UI <b>142</b> may be or include a touchscreen display being a combination of a display <b>144</b> and an input capability <b>146</b>. A network interface <b>148</b> may support wired and wireless communication over, for example, a WiFi network <b>114</b> or WiFI local area network (LAN). WiFI LAN involves a typical communication between the origin device <b>102</b> and a wireless access point or wireless router.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the network interface <b>148</b> may also support WiFi Direct, which allows peer-to-peer communication between devices, for example, between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> without the use of a wireless access point, e.g., a wireless router. In a case where the network interface <b>148</b> supports multiple WiFI modes, such as simultaneous LAN and Direct modes, the communications described below may be held in sequence between the communication parties without interruption to change WiFI modes. In another embodiment, where the network interface <b>148</b> does not support simultaneous LAN and Direct modes, the data from the various legs of communication may need to be cached and the required communication mode be switched to accomplish seamless communication.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The illustrated origin device <b>102</b> is depicted without a trusted zone, but as discussed above, there is no restriction on whether an origin device <b>102</b> does or does not have a trusted zone, only that in at least some circumstances, it may be desirable to shift some or all of the functions associated with a trusted zone to an enabler device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary enabler device <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the enabler device <b>112</b> may be based on a cellular phone, such as a smart phone. Other base units may also be modified into an enabler device <b>112</b> such as wearable devices or laptops. The enabler device <b>112</b> may include a processor <b>160</b>, a memory <b>162</b>, a cryptographic unit <b>172</b>, a trusted zone <b>174</b>, a user interface (UI) <b>180</b>, and a network interface <b>186</b>. A cryptographic unit <b>172</b> may provide necessary cryptographic functions including encrypting and decrypting, hashing, key generation, signing, and signature verification, among others, and may support both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. For example, the cryptographic unit <b>172</b> may support AES for symmetric encryption and RSA or elliptic curve for asymmetric encryption.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A trusted zone <b>174</b> may be used to store cryptographic secrets used in communications with other devices and for locally encrypting data. The trusted zone <b>174</b> may be used to store various keys, such as shared symmetric keys or private keys from PKI key-pairs. The trusted zone <b>174</b> may also store other privacy-related data such as personal account number (PAN) data that can be used to access financial accounts, medical records, or other personal accounts. The trusted zone <b>174</b> may be referred to by specific names in some products. For example, products from Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft may embody the functions of a trusted zone <b>174</b> in, respectively, a Secure Element, a Trusted Execution Environment, and a Trusted Platform Module. In some embodiments, the trusted zone <b>174</b> may be a smart chip, similar to a SIM card or the active element of a financial chip card. In some embodiments, the cryptographic unit <b>172</b> and the trusted zone <b>174</b> may be incorporated into the same physical structure. For example, it is common for smart chips to include cryptographic calculation capabilities.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As with the origin device <b>102</b>, the enabler device <b>112</b> may have a user interface <b>180</b> may be used to provide data to and receive instructions from a user. The UI <b>180</b> may include a display <b>182</b> and some form of tactile input such as keyboard or touchscreen <b>184</b>. In other embodiments, the UI <b>180</b> may include an audio input system for voice recognition. Improvements in gesture-based, eye following, and other developments in user interface technology are expected in the near future and would be expected to be incorporated into the enabler device <b>112</b>, the origin device <b>102</b>, or both.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A network interface <b>186</b> may support communication with external entities and may include support for both local and wide area networks and may, as discussed above, support simultaneous communication with separate endpoints.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also as above, the memory <b>162</b> may be a combination of volatile and non-volatile physical memories that do not include storage using carrier waves or propagated media. The memory <b>162</b> may include an operating system (OS)/utilities <b>164</b> performing functions similar to or the same as those described above, but in any case oriented toward the type of device. In an embodiment, the memory <b>162</b> may also include executable code used to support the base function of the enabler device <b>112</b>. For example, in the case of a cellular smart phone the executable code may support cellular voice and data communications, one or more cameras, clocks and timers, and various downloaded applications (apps). The enabler device <b>112</b> may also be provisioned with a token application program interface (API) <b>168</b> that is used by one or more applications to support communication with a token service provider <b>118</b>. That is, the token API <b>168</b> may be provisioned onto the enabler device <b>112</b> and instantiated by any application that needs to interact with the token service provider <b>118</b>. Another API provisioned on the enabler device <b>112</b> may be a transaction enabler <b>170</b>. The transaction enabler API <b>170</b> may be used to communicate with the origin device <b>102</b> by supporting functions such as WiFi service discovery and data transfer and to also invoke the services of the token API <b>168</b> as required.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are flowcharts illustrating various aspects of operation of the system <b>100</b> and its use in providing secure communications to an origin device <b>102</b> via an enabler device <b>112</b>. Briefly, when the origin device <b>102</b> desires a secure communication and either does not have the required capabilities to support the communication or has those capabilities but they are not currently available, the origin device <b>102</b> uses the services of another device to provide the capabilities missing at the origin device <b>102</b>. The services not at hand in the origin device <b>102</b> may include strong cryptographic support, secure storage of cryptographic secrets, or provisioning to participate in a token-based transaction environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>200</b> of providing these services to an origin device <b>102</b> via an enabler device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>202</b>, the origin device <b>102</b> obtains data corresponding to communication with a web server <b>106</b>. In one example, the origin device <b>102</b> may wish to securely report usage data to the web server <b>106</b>. In another example, the origin device <b>102</b> may be in communication with the web server <b>106</b> regarding a proposed purchase, such as a smart refrigerator recognizing that milk on hand has gone below a predetermined level and an order should be placed. The origin device <b>102</b> may contact the web server <b>106</b> of a designated merchant and add milk and any other shopping list items to a cart on the web server <b>106</b>, in anticipation of a payment transaction. In such a case, the web server <b>106</b> may have provided to the origin device <b>102</b> transaction (or cart) data and a certificate that are used as described below. In either the data transfer or the purchase transaction examples, a setting may have been established that these types of communications are only to be performed using a level of security that the origin device <b>102</b> is not capable of supporting.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At block <b>204</b>, the origin device <b>102</b> may search for an enabler device <b>112</b> that is capable of providing the necessary level of security. The search may be via a Wi-Fi Direct protocol using a service discovery request that allows nearby devices to respond with their ability to support the services required. If an enabler device <b>112</b> cannot be found, the &#x201c;no&#x201d; branch from block <b>206</b> may be taken to block <b>208</b>. There, a message may be displayed at the origin device <b>102</b> that no enabler device is available and the search for a suitable device repeats at block <b>204</b>. When, at block <b>206</b>, an enabler device <b>112</b> is found execution follows the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; branch to block <b>210</b> where communication between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> is established via applications using respective transaction enabler APIs <b>138</b> and <b>170</b>. In some embodiments, the user of the enabler device <b>112</b> may have to perform at least a one-time authorization to the connect to the origin device <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, the origin device <b>102</b> may be programmed to look for and attach to only pre-programmed devices, such as by device name or electronic identification number (EIN) such as when a particular user may want to ensure that he or she is aware of any data downloaded from a particular IoT device <b>102</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or any financial transactions associated with those devices. For example, in a two-part process, a user may first secure a particular enabler device <b>112</b> with a fingerprint or passphrase and then second limit communication for data downloads and purchase transactions for an origin device <b>102</b> to only that enabler device <b>112</b>. In an exemplary case, any attempt to change the identity of the paired enabler device <b>112</b> at the origin device <b>102</b> may result in erasing any sensitive data in the origin device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>212</b>, in an embodiment, a personal identification number (PIN) may be entered by a user into one or both of the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b>. The PIN may be generated by the origin device <b>102</b> and presented to a user for entry into the enabler device <b>112</b> or vice versa. In another embodiment, the user may simply be asked to select a number and enter the number into both devices <b>102</b>, <b>112</b>. The PIN may be combined with a shared passphrase to generate a session key used to encrypt communication between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b>. Even though the data communicated between these two devices <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> is not necessarily sensitive, the generation and use of the session key ensures that both entities received the same PIN, thereby providing a level of mutual authentication. Verification of the PIN via the session keys also provides a level of assurance that both devices <b>102</b>, <b>112</b> are in the control of someone who has access to the user interfaces <b>142</b>, <b>180</b> of both devices <b>102</b>, <b>112</b>, respectively. When session keys are used, all communication payloads sent between the origin device <b>102</b> and the enabler device <b>112</b> may be encrypted using the session keys. Any of a number of techniques may be used to generate the session keys at both the origin device <b>102</b> and enabler device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At block <b>214</b>, data from the origin device <b>102</b> may be sent to the enabler device <b>112</b>, after being encrypted with the session key, when encryption is used. The data sent may be data that is locally generated at the origin device <b>102</b>, such as meter or thermostat data, or may be purchase-related data such as a cart reference or price and item data and a web server certificate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The discussion of the process continues on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as the operations <b>216</b> at the enabler device <b>112</b> are described. Turning then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at block <b>240</b>, the enabler device <b>112</b> may have been provisioned with one or more secret keys <b>176</b> for use in communication with a downstream entity. In the illustrated embodiment, the downstream entity may be a token service provider <b>118</b>. In other embodiments, the downstream entity may be another web server, such as a cloud storage device used to store, for example, electricity usage data, home security system data, thermostat data, etc. The secret key or keys may be securely installed in the trusted zone <b>174</b> during the provisioning process. The secret keys <b>176</b> may be private keys from a PKI infrastructure or may be symmetric keys. The secret keys <b>176</b> may be used for authentication, signing and encryption operations.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>242</b>, the enabler device <b>112</b> may receive payload data from the origin device <b>102</b>. As discussed above, the payload data for one embodiment may include transaction-related data and a certificate for a web server <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the certificate may map to an entity rather than an individual server, based on the actual architecture of the downstream entity. Continuing with the illustrated embodiment, execution continues at block <b>246</b>, where the certificate is validated via a certificate authority. If the certificate fails to meet the required criteria, execution continues at block <b>248</b> where an error may be returned to the origin device <b>102</b>. If the certificate is valid, execution may follow the &#x201c;yes&#x201d; branch from block <b>246</b> to block <b>250</b>. There, the enabler device <b>112</b> may extract the public key of the web server <b>106</b> for later use.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>252</b>, the enabler device <b>112</b> may evaluate the nature of the data to be processed on behalf of the origin device <b>102</b>. In the case of pure data being sent to a cloud service, a simple encryption using an appropriate key may be performed. In the case of a transaction, a default payment instrument may be selected. In another embodiment of a transaction, a user of the enabler device <b>112</b> may be asked to select a payment instrument, for example from a list of available instruments that may include credit or debit accounts, rewards point accounts, gift cards, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once a payment instrument is selected, the enabler device <b>112</b> may generate a token request message including transaction details, encrypt the token request message with the token service provider secret key <b>176</b> provisioned earlier, and send the encrypted payload to the token service provider <b>118</b>. At block <b>254</b>, the token service provider <b>118</b> may decrypt the payload using its copy of the secret key <b>176</b> and follow a standardized procedure to generate token response message including a token and cryptogram related to the transaction. The token service provider <b>118</b> may then encrypt the token response message with its secret key <b>176</b> and return the encrypted payload to the enabler device <b>112</b>. While the use of a secret (i.e. symmetric) key <b>176</b> is discussed here for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment, it will be understood that public/private key pairs can be used to accomplish the same functions of privacy and authentication.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>256</b>, the enabler device receives the encrypted payload and decrypts the token and cryptogram using the secret key <b>176</b>. In an alternate embodiment where the data from the origin device <b>102</b> is not transaction related, blocks <b>252</b> through <b>256</b> may not be executed because the use of a token service provider <b>118</b> may not be required. Similarly, in embodiments where a token is locally provisioned and the enabler device <b>112</b> has the ability to generate the transaction cryptogram, the need to communicate with the token service provider <b>118</b> may be reduced or eliminated. That is, the enabler device <b>112</b> may simply encrypt the data payload received from the origin device <b>102</b> with the secret key provisioned at block <b>240</b> and return the encrypted payload to the origin device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>258</b>, the token response message including the token and cryptogram generated at the token service provider <b>118</b> may be encrypted with the web server public key extracted at block <b>250</b>. The use of the web server public key for encryption ensures that the token and cryptogram are protected from inspection and/or alteration during transport to the web server <b>106</b>. For the purpose of illustration, the use of a PKI security model is discussed. In other embodiments, depending on the ultimate endpoint of the data transmission, a pre-provisioned secret (symmetric) key could be used to encrypt the payload at the enabler device <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After the token and cryptogram are so encrypted they may be sent, at block <b>260</b>, back to the origin device <b>102</b>. As discussed above, the encrypted token and cryptogram may be further encrypted with the session key of the origin device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, execution may continue at block <b>218</b> where the doubly encrypted payload from the enabler device <b>112</b> is received and the session key is used to decrypt the transmission. The origin device <b>102</b> may send the encrypted token and cryptogram to the web server <b>106</b> where, at block <b>222</b>, the web server may process the request by decrypting the token and cryptogram using its private key and sending the transaction information through the normal financial processing network, which may include resolution of the token into a personal account number (PAN) and approval of the transaction at an issuer. At block <b>224</b>, the origin device <b>102</b> may receive a response from the web server <b>106</b> indicating whether the transaction has been approved or denied.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The disclosed system and method uses a modified IoT device (origin device) coupled to a modified device with a trusted zone (enabler device) to allow the origin device <b>102</b> without either the processing resources, such as a trusted zone, to participate in secure communications including private data transmission or purchase transactions even though the origin device is either inherently incapable of or not provisioned for the secure processing required to support those functions. That is, a simple connected device that lacks a trusted zone or a support for a payment application may, for a given operation, attach to the enabler device <b>112</b> so that the enabler device <b>112</b> can provide those services, e.g., services afforded by a trusted zone, that are not available at the origin device. As opposed to PayPal&#x2122;, a merchant does not redirect a transaction flow to a payment party (PayPay), but rather the origin device <b>102</b> simply enlists another device such as a cellular phone to generate a required payload prior to a transaction being initiated. This may include mutual authentication (e.g., via the PIN exchange), encrypting content, and preprocessing the data to generate a cryptogram and token. The use of short range communication networks, such as Bluetooth or WiFi, helps to ensure that an operator of the enabler device <b>112</b> is aware of the request from the origin device <b>102</b> and can be actively involved in the process. A further benefit is that IoT devices can be configured to use the same enabler device so that a person with multiple IoT devices (cars, thermostats, home security systems, appliances, etc.) can be confident that each device will only participate in sensitive communication via a known enabler device <b>112</b> with a pre-defined level of security.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The figures depict preferred embodiments for purposes of illustration only.
