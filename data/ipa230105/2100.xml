Each of these can containers has at least a can barrel and a can bottom.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to reduce raw materials used in such can containers, reducing the weight of the container by reducing the sheet thickness thereof has been promoted, and the shape of the can bottom has been innovated as necessary in order to obtain a predetermined pressure resistance strength of the container, even with the reduced sheet thickness.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The can bottom shape for increasing the pressure resistance strength is generally achieved by shaping a dome part in which the center of the can bottom is concaved into a dome shape toward an inside of the can container along a direction of a can axis, and shaping an annular convex part functioning as a support part on an outer peripheral edge of the dome part.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, in order to increase the pressure resistance strength, there has been proposed the prior art in which the shapes of the dome part and the annular convex part described above are appropriately designed, wherein, for example, an inner peripheral wall of the annular convex part that is connected to the dome part is shaped to include a first concave curved surface part that has, in a vertical cross section view along the direction of a can axis, a curved shape concaved toward the outside in a radial direction orthogonal to the can axis, the dome part is shaped to include a dome top positioned on the can axis, and a second concave curved surface part that is connected to a radially outer side of the dome top and forms a concave curved shape having a smaller radius of curvature than the dome top, and an outer peripheral edge part of the dome part is shaped to include a linear taper part that connects the first concave curved surface part and the second concave curved surface part described above and comes into contact with the first curved surface part and the second curved surface part (see PTL 1 below).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">[PTL 1] Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2016-43991</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">TECHNICAL PROBLEM</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the prior art described above, after forming the dome part and the annular convex part on the bottom part, the inner peripheral wall of the annular convex part described above is reformed to shape the first concave curved surface part and the taper part described above, wherein the first concave curved surface part is roll-formed to forms a curved surface by a formed surface of a forming tool. In such reforming using a forming roll, it is inevitable that the curved surface of the first concave curved surface part has a radius of curvature that is large enough to implement the roll formation, and there is a limit to causing the inner peripheral surface of the annular convex part to concave deeper toward the outside in the radial direction orthogonal to the can axis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, in the prior art described above, in roll-forming the first concave curved surface part, it is necessary to prevent the roll from interfering with the dome part, and consequently there is a limit to increasing the distance (height h) in the direction of the can axis between the center of the radius of curvature (R<b>1</b>) of the first concave curved surface part and a nose part (an outer edge of the annular convex part along the direction of the can axis).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For this reason, in the prior art, even if the reforming is performed, the inner peripheral surface of the annular convex part cannot be concaved deeper toward the outside in the radial direction orthogonal to the can axis, and the distance in the direction of the can axis between the center of the radius of curvature of the first concave curved surface part and the nose part cannot be further increased, leading to a problem that the pressure resistance strength cannot be improved effectively.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, in the prior art, attempting to achieve a deeper concave by means of roll forming leads to the destruction of the oxide film of the aluminum alloy, which is the material of the can, and sterilizing the can after filling the can with contents causes blackening of the surface of a roll-formed part, deteriorating the aesthetic appearance of the product.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention was contrived in order to address such circumstances.

The can bottom <b>1</b>B includes a dome part <b>10</b> and an annular convex part <b>20</b>, and in the illustrated example, an outer wall part <b>30</b> is provided on the outside of the annular convex part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The dome part <b>10</b> is provided in the center of the can bottom <b>1</b>B and includes a curved surface concaved into a dome shape toward the inside of the can container <b>1</b> along the direction of the can axis &#x25ef;. In the illustrated example, the curved surface of the dome part <b>10</b> includes, at a central part thereof, a first curved surface <b>11</b> having a radius of curvature R<b>1</b> and, around the first curved surface <b>11</b>, a second curved surface <b>12</b> having a radius of curvature R<b>2</b> smaller than the radius of curvature R<b>1</b>. The configuration of the dome part <b>10</b> is not limited thereto; the dome part <b>10</b> may be a curved surface having a single radius of curvature.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The annular convex part <b>20</b> is shaped projecting outward along the direction of the can axial of the can container <b>1</b> so as to shape an annular support part <b>21</b> around the outer periphery of the dome part <b>10</b>. The support part <b>21</b> is a part that supports the can container <b>1</b> on a plane, and is shaped on a support surface <b>21</b>A orthogonal to the can axis &#x25ef;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the can bottom <b>1</b>B, an inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> extending from the support part <b>21</b> of the annular convex part <b>20</b> to an outer peripheral edge part <b>10</b>A of the dome part <b>10</b> has a recessed part <b>22</b>A that is inclined in a direction in which the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> separates from the can axis &#x25ef;, the recessed part <b>22</b>A being connected to the outer peripheral edge part <b>10</b>A of the dome part <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the recessed part <b>22</b>A in the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> of the annular convex part <b>20</b>, the outer peripheral edge part <b>10</b>A of the dome part <b>10</b> is positioned farther away from the can axis &#x25ef; than an innermost part <b>22</b>B of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> (a part of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> that is closest to the can axis &#x25ef;). Therefore, an imaginary line L<b>1</b> that is in contact with the innermost part <b>22</b>B of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> and parallel to the can axis &#x25ef; intersects with a curved surface of the dome part <b>10</b> (for example, the second curved surface <b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, in a more specific example, the recessed part <b>22</b>A in the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> includes a linear tapered surface <b>22</b>T in a vertical cross section view along the can axis &#x25ef;. The tapered surface <b>22</b>T shapes an obtuse inclination angle &#x3b8; with the support surface <b>21</b>A that is in contact with the support part <b>21</b> described above. This inclination angle &#x3b8; is an angle on the can axis &#x25ef; side, between the tapered surface <b>22</b>T and the support surface <b>21</b>A, and the angle is preferably set to 100&#xb0; to 125&#xb0; in order to obtain a high pressure resistance strength of the can bottom <b>1</b>B.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The recessed part <b>22</b>A on the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> reaches the outer peripheral edge part <b>10</b>A of the dome part <b>10</b> through a concave of an outermost part <b>22</b>C (a part of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> that is farthest from the can axis &#x25ef;), from the tapered surface <b>22</b>T described above. The outermost part <b>22</b>C is not shaped by roll forming as in the prior art described above, but is shaped as a bent part resulting from compressive deformation in the direction of the can axis, so that the radius of curvature of the curved surface of the outermost part <b>22</b>C is set to be smaller (for example, 0.7 mm or less) than the radius of curvature of the first concave curved surface part in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the outermost part <b>22</b>C on the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> can be concaved deeper in the direction away from the can axis &#x25ef; in relation to the innermost part <b>22</b>B on the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b>. Here, assuming that an imaginary line in contact with the outermost part <b>22</b>C and parallel to the can axis &#x25ef; is L<b>2</b>, the distance d (depth of the recessed part <b>22</b>A) between the imaginary line L<b>1</b> described above and the imaginary line L<b>2</b> is preferably set to 0.3 mm to 1.0 mm in order to obtain a high pressure resistance strength of the can bottom <b>1</b>B.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, when the outermost part <b>22</b>C of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> is a compressive deformation bent part, a roll forming trace that is generated when shaping the curved surface by means of the roll forming as in the prior art does not exist on the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b>. For this reason, the aesthetic appearance of the inner peripheral surface <b>22</b> that includes the outermost part <b>22</b>C shaped as the compressive deformation bent part can be prevented from being degraded by the roll forming trace (blackening caused by the destruction of the aluminum oxide film) When the outermost part <b>22</b>C is taken as a compressive deformation bent part, the height h from the support surface <b>21</b>A to the outermost part <b>22</b>C is the forming height. This height h is preferably 2.0 mm to 4.0 mm in order to obtain a high pressure resistance strength of the can bottom <b>1</b>B.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiment of the present invention having such a can bottom shape has a higher can bottom pressure resistance strength than the prior art described above. The can bottom pressure resistance strength here refers to the buckling strength of the can bottom obtained when the concave shape of the can bottom is completely inverted. When a dome depth hs of the can bottom and a grounding diameter ds (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are set to hs=10.63 mm and ds=45.5 mm, and when comparing the can bottom pressure resistance strength of the embodiment of the present invention (&#x3b8;=115&#xb0;, h=2.6 mm) and the can bottom pressure resistance strength of the prior art for each original sheet thickness, the strength of the embodiment of the present invention is approximately 1.2 to 1.5 times higher than that of the prior art as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The recessed part <b>22</b>A described above is shaped by forming the dome part <b>10</b> and the annular convex part <b>20</b> in the can bottom <b>1</b>B and then reforming the dome part <b>10</b> and the annular convex part <b>20</b> to cause compressive deformation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> each show the difference in can bottom pressure resistance strength between cans with two types of bottom shapes (capacity: 350 ml, grounding diameter of &#x3d5;49) having a dome depth prior to reforming of 13.45 mm and 13.95 mm, the difference being obtained after the above-mentioned inclination angle &#x3b8; is changed and the reforming is performed. The values in the parentheses in the drawings indicate the values of the height h (the forming height from the support surface <b>21</b>A to the outermost part <b>22</b>C) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> obtained when the inclination angle &#x3b8; is changed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the inclination angle &#x3b8; is in the range of 100&#xb0; to 125&#xb0; , a desired can bottom pressure resistance strength can be obtained. The larger the dome depth hs of the can bottom, the higher the can bottom pressure resistance strength, but if the dome depth hs is increased, it becomes inevitably difficult to secure the internal volume of the can required for the can container to be filled with the contents from a certain range. In addition, the larger the inclination angle &#x3b8; is within a certain range, the higher the can bottom pressure resistance strength becomes, but when the inclination angle &#x3b8; exceeds the certain range, the deformation mode changes, thereby inverting only the dome part <b>10</b> and lowering the can bottom pressure resistance strength.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Using a hydraulic buckling tester, the can bottom pressure resistance strength described above was measured as the lowest internal pressure at which the concave shape of the can bottom was inverted, by sealing the inside of the can container near the center of the can barrel in the direction of the can axis, with the can container being placed upright without fixing the can bottom, and injecting water to raise the pressure inside the can container at a pressure increasing speed of 30 kPals by the water pressure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Required values of the can bottom pressure resistance strength vary depending on the type of the container, the type of the liquid of the content, the sterilization conditions, and the like. However, when, for example, filling the container with some carbonated drink, a high pressure resistance strength is required, but even in such a case, it is determined that a pressure resistance strength of 690 kPa is sufficient.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the embodiment of the present invention has been described above in detail with reference to the drawings, specific configurations of the present invention are not limited thereto, and design modifications and the like not departing from the gist of the present invention are also included in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference Signs List</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><b>1</b> Can container</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><b>1</b>A Can barrel</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><b>1</b>B Can bottom</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><b>10</b> Dome part</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><b>10</b>A Outer peripheral edge part</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><b>11</b> First curved surface</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><b>12</b> Second curved surface</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><b>20</b> Annular convex part</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><b>21</b> Support part</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><b>21</b>A Support surface</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><b>22</b> Inner peripheral surface</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><b>22</b>A Recessed part</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><b>22</b>B Innermost part</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><b>22</b>C Outermost part</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><b>22</b>T Tapered surface</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">&#x25ef; Can axis</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">&#x3b8; Inclination angle</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
