As described above, NPL 1 uses a common organic material for the hole injection layer and the hole transport layer. The reason for shortening the distance from the carrier transport layer to the quantum dot core in such a light-emitting element is presumably because it is more difficult for carriers to be injected from the carrier transport layer into the quantum dot core in blue quantum dots compared to red quantum dots and green quantum dots.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">On the other hand, NPL 2 uses NiO for the hole transport layer as described above. NiO is a type of metal chalcogenide. The reason for lengthening the distance from the carrier transport layer to the quantum dot core in such a light-emitting element is presumably because the presence of a hydroxyl group on the metal chalcogenide surface charges the quantum dots, which degrades the characteristics of the light-emitting element.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">However, according to the studies of the inventors of the present application, when a metal chalcogenide is used in a layer having hole transport properties and the thickness of the quantum dot shell of each light-emitting element differing in light emission wavelength is increased, the luminance of the light-emitting element that emits light in a wavelength band having the shortest light emission peak wavelength lowers, as described above.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Therefore, the inventors of the present application conducted further extensive studies. As a result, the inventors of the present application found that the problem described above can be solved by making the layer thickness of the intermediate layer between the EML and the layer composed of a metal chalcogenide in the light-emitting element that emits light in a wavelength band having the shortest light emission peak wavelength greater than the layer thicknesses of the corresponding intermediate layers of the other light-emitting elements.
