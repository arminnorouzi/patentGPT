No. 16/715,242, filed Dec. 16, 2019, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments disclosed herein relate to stacked interposer structures and to microelectronic device assemblies including such stacked interposer structures, as well as to methods of fabrication of such structures and assemblies. More particularly, embodiments disclosed herein relate to assemblies comprising stacked interposer structures, each interposer comprising a semiconductor material and incorporating interface functions for mutual high bandwidth communication between microelectronic devices operably coupled to the stacked interposer structure, to assemblies of such microelectronic devices incorporating stacked interposer structures, to methods of fabrication of such structures and assemblies and to related electronic systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many forms of microelectronic devices such as IC (integrated circuit) assemblies include multiple semiconductor die (also referred to herein as &#x201c;die&#x201d;) or assemblies of such die physically and electrically connected to one another through an interposer. In some cases, such assembly on the interposer may be termed a &#x201c;Multi-Chip Package&#x201d; or &#x201c;MCP.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the interposer may include a redistribution structure (sometimes termed in the art a &#x201c;redistribution layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;RDL,&#x201d; as discussed further below) configured to establish interconnections between two or more of the multiple die within the assembly, and also to facilitate electrical and mechanical attachment to other devices (for example, a printed circuit board, such as a motherboard, or other higher-level packaging).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such an RDL may include one or more dielectric layers, each dielectric layer supporting a level of conductive material defining conductive traces and vias extending through the respective dielectric layer to connect, directly or indirectly, with respective contacts on one or more semiconductor die and/or with vias in other layers of the RDL, to redistribute the die contacts to other locations on or within the interposer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Interposers may be constructed with a core structure including either a non-organic material, such as a semiconductor material, such as silicon (generally termed a &#x201c;silicon interposer&#x201d;), or any one (or more) organic materials (generally termed an &#x201c;organic interposer&#x201d;). The term &#x201c;semiconductor interposer&#x201d; is used herein to identify an interposer comprising, (e.g., having a core formed of) a semiconductor material, which may be either an elemental material (such as e.g., silicon, germanium selenium, etc., as known to persons skilled in the art), or a compound semiconductor material (such as, e.g., gallium arsenide, indium gallium arsenide, also as known to persons skilled in the art). The term &#x201c;non-organic interposer&#x201d; is used to identify a core formed of a non-organic material which may be, for example, a semiconductor material, a glass material and/or a ceramic material. For purposes of providing examples herein, the embodiments of disclosed semiconductor interposers will be described in the form of silicon interposers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Under conventional processing, organic interposers tend to be more resilient, and therefore more resistant to cracking or other damage resulting from physical or thermal stresses. That resistance to physical or thermal stresses is somewhat offset, however, by organic interposers typically having a significantly different coefficient of thermal expansion (&#x201c;CTE&#x201d;) from the CTE of the semiconductor die or die assemblies attached to the interposer, thus being susceptible to generating physical stress at the die attachment. In addition, commercially viable technology for forming organic interposers experiences difficulty in providing line spacings of less than about 10/10 &#x3bc;LS. This current practical limitation leaves a significant dimensional gap relative to feature spacing achievable in conventional silicon processing employed in fabricating state of the art semiconductor die. As a result, current commercially viable processes for forming organic interposers cannot match the minimum contact spacing of semiconductor die that would desirably be attached to the interposer, imposing an undesirable restriction in terms of real estate required for microelectronic device assemblies and requiring undesirably long signal paths.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, interposer performance characteristics are becoming of increasing importance for implementation of some high bandwidth applications. One example of a microelectronic assembly disclosed herein includes high bandwidth communications between one or more high bandwidth memory (HBM) devices and a processor. While each memory device may be an individual semiconductor die, it is becoming increasingly common for each memory device to comprise a vertical stack of multiple (e.g., four, eight, twelve, sixteen, etc.) memory die interconnected by through silicon vias (TSVs) and inter-die conductive elements, such as copper pillars, operably coupled to the TSVs. In some instances, the stack further includes an operably coupled logic die, which may also be characterized as a controller or interface die. In order to obtain full performance benefit of such multi-die memory devices, an associated processor must be able to access multiple portions of the interconnected memory die in parallel through high-speed parallel communication channels for data, command, and control signals between the processor and the multi-die memory device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To meet design criteria for such high-speed parallel communications, including without limitation minimization of conductive trace resistance and inter-trace capacitance, interposers are projected to require tighter line spacing (&#x201c;L/S&#x201d;), of less than 5/5&#x3bc; LS, and preferably on the order of 2/2&#x3bc; LS or smaller. Semiconductor interposers, for example silicon interposers, may be configured to provide such L/S capability since they may be fabricated employing conventional semiconductor die fabrication methods.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While use of semiconductor material-based interposers addresses the above issues, it is conventional as noted above, in implementation of HBM devices to employ a discrete interface die between the stack of memory die of each HBM device and an interposer. Such an approach increases fabrication and assembly costs, lengthens signal paths, and increases height of the HBM device assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to the abovementioned considerations for desirability of implementing interposers using semiconductor (e.g., silicon) materials, utilization of semiconductor materials may also facilitate reduction in cost and size of certain processor categories, for example graphic processing units (GPUs). It has been proposed that GPU designs monolithically integrate cache memory in the form of static random access memory (SRAM). Unfortunately, such an approach would suffer from a requirement of incorporating TSVs in the GPU, but fabrication of the SRAM cache memory requires a significantly different process sequence than is employed in GPU fabrication. In addition, SRAM may consume an undesirable amount of real estate in the GPU due to its memory component structure. Other processors such as central processing units (CPUs), controllers and so-called System on a Chip (SoC) as well as other host devices may also suffer from a somewhat awkward integration of cache memory circuitry with processor circuitry fabrication techniques.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the disclosure encompass stacked interposer structures, the interposers of which may be cooperatively configured for, in combination, effectively providing such high bandwidth communication while reducing fabrication and assembly costs and reducing component and assembly size. Microelectronic device assemblies incorporating such stacked interposer structures and methods for fabricating such assemblies may offer advantages in terms of cost reduction, higher yield and enhanced performance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a microelectronic assembly including a host device in the form of a processor, and multiple memory devices mounted to a stacked interposer structure according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic top elevation of a microelectronic device assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, including multiple memory devices and the processor supported on and operably coupled the stacked interposer structure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a schematic side elevation of the microelectronic device assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> according to an embodiment of the disclosure, depicting the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> with the stacked interposer structure mounted to a laminate substrate having conductive elements on an opposing side thereof for connection to higher-level packaging;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a schematic side elevation of the microelectronic device assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> according to an embodiment of the disclosure, depicting the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> without a laminate substrate, a lower interposed of the stacked interposer structure having conductive elements on a side thereof opposite the microelectronic devices for connection to higher-level packaging;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in the form of an HBM cube including multiple memory dice stacked on an interface circuitry segment integrated within the interposer;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side sectional schematic elevation of an interposer comprising a semiconductor core according to embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> are schematic side elevation of, respectively, two cooperatively configured interposers with a semiconductor core, the two interposers stacked together to form a stacked interposer structure, and a microelectronic device assembly comprising a memory device and a host device according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>D-<b>3</b>F</figref> are schematic side elevation of, respectively, two cooperatively configured interposers with a semiconductor core, the two interposers stacked together to form a stacked interposer structure, and a microelectronic device assembly comprising a memory device and a host device according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a microelectronic device assembly incorporating a stacked interposer structure in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a simplified cross-sectional representation of an example section of an embodiment of an interposer having a semiconductor core and incorporating logic structures according to embodiments of the disclosure;

For example, in one such embodiment, as depicted, the conductive paths may alternate between TSV paths in alternate die within the stack, as schematically depicted at <b>124</b>, in conductive paths <b>122</b>F-<b>122</b>G. Other, more complex, interleaved conductive paths may also be implemented. In some examples, one or more of the conductive paths as will connect to each of the stacked memory die; while in other examples a vertical conductive path may only electrically connect to communicate with other circuitry in a subset of the stacked memory die. For example, in the context of memory device <b>118</b> some TSVs might extend directly through the lowermost memory die <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>D without connecting with other circuitry; and form electrical interconnections with circuitry only in the upper half of the stacked memory die <b>108</b>E-<b>108</b>H. In other examples, TSVs might form electrical connections only with alternating die within a stack of memory die.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally, individual memory die <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>H, or some portion thereof, may each contain multiple partitions (as indicated at <b>130</b>A-<b>130</b>H on memory die <b>108</b>H). Some or all of memory die <b>108</b>A-<b>108</b>H may be partitioned similarly. These partitions (or some subset thereof), may be vertically interconnected with corresponding partitions of other memory devices in the stack through the above discussed vertical connections, forming an independently operable memory unit. In some examples, the memory unit can include two or more vertically aligned partitions; and in some examples may include vertically aligned partitions from all memory die in the stack. As indicated in partition <b>130</b>A, each partition may be further subdivided into multiple banks or other subdivisions, such as individual memory channels. As one example, four banks (as indicated at <b>132</b>A-<b>132</b>D, defining four banks) are formed within partition <b>130</b>A, with each bank including further subdivided units, for example representing individual memory channels (indicated typically at <b>134</b>). In some examples, these further subdivisions will be vertically interconnected in the same manner as described for the partitions to include portions of memory in multiple, or all, memory die in the stack, which may then be operated as a group.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the figure depicts a simplified cross-sectional representation of an embodiment of interposer <b>200</b> suitable for use in implementation of embodiments of the disclosure comprising assemblies of memory and a host device, for example a processor. Interposer <b>200</b> includes a semiconductor core, which for purposes of the present example will be described as a silicon core <b>202</b> having multiple TSVs <b>204</b> extending through silicon core <b>202</b>. As is known to persons skilled in the art, TSVs <b>204</b> each include a conductive structure, commonly a metal, extending within an insulator isolating the conductive structure from the surrounding silicon. By utilizing a silicon core <b>202</b>, TSVs can be arranged in a more compact spacing than would be feasible with current organic interposer technology. In some examples, for example, TSVs may be arranged at a pitch of 40 &#x3bc;m or less, for example, a pitch of approximately 20 &#x3bc;m. In many examples, the pitch of at least some portion of the TSVs will be sized to match a contact pitch of the semiconductor die or other devices coupled to interposer <b>200</b>. In such examples, the contact pitch of TSVs can correspond to the contact pitch(s) of the die or other device coupled to interposer <b>200</b>. In the depicted example, a conductive level (designated M<b>1</b>) extends &#x201c;over&#x201d; a side of core <b>202</b>, conductive level M<b>1</b> electrically insulated from the core <b>202</b> by a respective dielectric level <b>208</b>A (which may include one or more dielectric materials). The term &#x201c;over&#x201d; is used in the present description for clarity, and refers to the material or level being relatively outward from the core <b>202</b>. As will be recognized by persons of skill in the art, the materials and structures to one side of the core will typically be formed at different times, during which the respective side of the core over which a material is being formed will face directionally upward. Similarly, the term &#x201c;under&#x201d; is used herein to denote a structure closer to the core.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Conductive level M<b>1</b> will in many examples be patterned to define conductive traces <b>210</b>, at least some of which will interconnect with respective TSVs <b>204</b>, as depicted. Some conductive traces <b>210</b> may not connect with respective TSVs, and may just provide interconnection for conductive traces formed above conductive level M<b>1</b>. The term &#x201c;redistribution layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;RDL&#x201d; is used in the industry in multiple contexts sometimes to refer to a single level of a multi-level structure, and sometimes to refer to the multi-level structure itself. Herein, for clarity, the term &#x201c;redistribution layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;RDL&#x201d; is used to refer to a respective dielectric level supporting a respective metal level (as discussed below); and the term &#x201c;redistribution structure&#x201d; will be used to refer to multiple overlying individual RDLs as a group. Redistribution structures as described herein may be fabricated using BEOL techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art and may correspond in structure and function to BEOL structures B as previously described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B through <b>1</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A first redistribution structure <b>214</b> may be formed over a first side of core <b>202</b>. Redistribution structure <b>214</b> includes multiple respective redistribution layers (RDLs). Each of the multiple RDLs, in the example, redistribution structure <b>214</b> includes four RDLs, although the number of RDLs is not so limited, and it is contemplated that a greater number of RDLs, for example six RDLS, may be employed in a redistribution structure to accommodate power and bias (e.g., ground) as well as signal transmission. In redistribution structure <b>214</b>, RDLs <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, extend over a first side of core <b>202</b> and metal level M<b>1</b> formed thereon. Each RDL includes a respective dielectric level <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, each dielectric level <b>226</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> supporting a respective metal (or other conductive material) level M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, M<b>5</b>. Each metal level M<b>1</b>-M<b>5</b> will preferably be patterned to collectively form conductive traces to redistribute contacts of a semiconductor die or other microelectronic device or structure mounted to interposer <b>200</b> to desired locations within interposer <b>200</b>. Of course, as noted above, a redistribution structure in the form of four RDLs is by way of example only, and a different number of RDLs may be employed.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, all metal levels M<b>1</b>-M<b>5</b> may be formed of the same metal. In other examples, however, outermost metal level M<b>5</b> will typically form surfaces for connecting (directly or through an interconnection structure) with complementary contact structures of another device. In the case of outermost metal level M<b>5</b>, the level will form surfaces suitable connecting with contacts of a semiconductor die, or other microelectronic device. As a result of the different functions of these metal levels, and the likely exposure of the metal to potentially oxidizing environments after formation, in some examples one or both of the outermost metal levels may be formed of another conductive material that oxidizes more slowly than the metal used for used for other levels. For example, for examples in which metal levels M<b>1</b>-M<b>4</b> are formed of copper, outermost metal level M<b>5</b> may be formed of aluminum. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, other conductive materials and/or other metals may be used for any one or more of conductive levels corresponding to metal levels M<b>1</b>-M<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In many examples, the dielectric levels of the RDLs will comprise primarily, or in significant part, a polyimide compound. In general, a polyimide compound will be more elastic, and less prone to cracking, than other dielectric materials used in other locations in semiconductor manufacturing (such as silicon oxide (in various forms), silicon nitride, etc.). Additionally, the polyimide material may be formed at lower temperatures than other materials used in build-up applications, thereby minimizing stress on core <b>202</b> during manufacture of interposer <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Interposer <b>200</b> may further include circuitry <b>280</b> formed within the dimensions of core <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, circuitry <b>280</b> may include passive components (such as resistors, inductors, capacitors) that may be formed, at least in part, in the bulk semiconductor (silicon) of core <b>202</b>. In other examples, the components may be formed, at least in part, of materials deposited in recesses formed in core <b>202</b>. In some examples, the passive components may be formed entirely within the dimensions of the core. In such examples, individual circuit elements may connect outside of the core through interconnection to one or more TSVs <b>204</b> extending through core <b>202</b>, or through one or more micro-vias <b>282</b> formed as a portion of M<b>1</b> formed over the upper surface of core <b>202</b>, and extending through dielectric level <b>208</b>A over the first surface of core <b>202</b>. In some cases, multiple passive components may be connected to one another. For example, resistors and capacitors may be coupled together to form a resistor/capacitor circuit. As one example, such a resistor/capacitor circuit, or an inductor, may be coupled and adapted to condition signals on conductive traces extending through one or more of the RDL layers of redistribution structure <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In embodiments of the disclosure, active circuit components may be located within the dimensions of core <b>202</b>. Many forms of circuitry including active components will beneficially be formed with one or more bodies within the bulk silicon of core <b>202</b>, with one or more additional bodies formed in materials extending over core <b>202</b>. In many forms of such devices, regions of silicon core <b>202</b> may be isolated from one another by shallow trench isolation in silicon core <b>202</b>; and isolated regions of silicon core <b>202</b> may be doped relative to the remaining silicon of silicon core <b>202</b>. Specifically, and as noted above, interface circuitry segments <b>120</b>A-<b>120</b>D may be formed within or over core <b>202</b>. In addition, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, cache memory in the form of SRAM may be formed within and over core <b>202</b> at least partially under the footprint of processor <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, TSVs <b>204</b> extend from metal level M<b>1</b> through core <b>202</b> of interposer <b>200</b>, for connecting individual circuit elements outside of core <b>202</b>, but also for connecting metal levels M<b>2</b>-M<b>5</b> and, therefore, data, power and bias (e.g., ground) signals to and from microelectronic devices, such as memory and processor, mounted to interposer <b>200</b> and connected by contacts <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>) to metal level M<b>5</b>.

Similarly, TSVs <b>204</b> may be initially fabricated in the form of blind holes, for example of about 65 &#x3bc;m depth in semiconductor core of a greater thickness, for example a partially thinned wafer of about 100 &#x3bc;m thickness, the blind ends revealed by thinning of the core, and back side pads (i.e., conductive pads <b>216</b>) formed on the revealed ends by blanket conductive material deposition and patterning, all as known to those of ordinary skill in the art of semiconductor device fabrication.

However, embodiments of the stacked interposer designs of the present disclosure are far easier and less costly to fabricate, employing techniques already in use to fabricate active and passive circuitry in and on a semiconductor wafer and redistribution structures in the form of multiple RDLs on the wafer active surface. In addition, utilization of embodiments of the present disclosure may enhance throughput while increasing yield. For some examples, it will be desirable to form stacked interposers <b>200</b> with the same number of multiple RDLs in redistribution structures <b>214</b>. As discussed later herein, in some examples the symmetrical structure may also be beneficial to conveying signals in multiple conductive channels (e.g., in some examples, with a first conductive channel implemented at least in part through metal levels M<b>2</b>-M<b>5</b> in first redistribution structure <b>214</b>, and a second conductive channel implemented at least in part through metal levels M<b>2</b>-M<b>5</b> of second redistribution structure <b>214</b>). Also, there may be an unequal number of RDLs on each interposer <b>200</b>, and individual RDLs may have vertical dimensions different than other RDLs. Further, it is contemplated that more than two interposers <b>200</b> may be stacked in various cooperative configurations and orientations in instances where height limitations of an assembly incorporating stacked interposers are not an issue.
