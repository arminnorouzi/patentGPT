on Jul. 2, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an anode active material, a method of manufacturing the anode active material, and an anode and a secondary battery including the anode active material, and specifically, to an anode active material capable of improving characteristics of secondary batteries such as capacity, lifespan and rate controlling, a method of manufacturing the anode active material, and an anode and a secondary battery including the anode active material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Graphite is a major anode (e.g., negative electrode) active material for commercial lithium secondary batteries. Due to its layered structure, reversible electrochemical lithium insertion/deintercalation is possible, and a high energy density may be achieved when forming a battery with a cathode (e.g., positive electrode) by virtue of its low reduction potential. In this graphite anode material, lithium may only enter and exit through an edge plane of the layered structure. However, since graphite is manufactured through a spheroidization process, exposure of the edge plane to an electrolyte is small, so a passage of lithium for entering and exiting is limited. Accordingly, lithium insertion into the graphite active material may stagnate during rapid charging, and dendrites were thus formed. This not only degrades rate controlling and lifespan performance of the secondary battery, but also causes a short circuit with the cathode, which may cause a fire.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, since graphite has a narrow interplanar distance (d<sub>002</sub>=0.335 nm) of a base surface, structural deformation occurs when lithium is inserted, thereby slowing an initial reaction rate in the lithium secondary battery. In addition, cations such as Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Al<sup>3+ </sup>used in next-generation secondary batteries are not easy to enter and exit from graphite because of their large diameters, and accordingly, when graphite is used as an anode active material for next-generation secondary batteries, there was a problem in that the capacity, lifespan, and rate of the secondary battery are degraded.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects of embodiments of the present invention are directed to an anode active material applicable to a secondary battery to improve characteristics of the secondary battery such as capacity, lifespan and rate controlling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment, an anode active material includes secondary carbon particles formed by flocculation of a plurality of primary carbon particles having an average particle diameter (D<sub>50</sub>) in a range from 5 to 200 nm, wherein the secondary carbon particles have an average particle diameter (D<sub>50</sub>) in a range from 0.5 to 20 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, an anode includes the anode active material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment, a secondary battery includes the anode.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment, a method of manufacturing an anode active material includes: (S<b>100</b>) forming a first solution by dissolving a carbonization precursor polymer and a sacrificial polymer in a first solvent which is a common solvent;

In addition, in the anode active material of the present invention, the secondary carbon particles may improve an electrode density, and when the secondary carbon particles are mixed with graphite, a low operating voltage of graphite may be compensated to improve a charge/discharge rate, and it is possible to further improve an energy density of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, in the anode active material of the present invention, the secondary carbon particles have a spherical porous structure.

The sacrificial polymer may be easily removed by organic solvents while assisting the carbonization precursor polymer to form micelles as a matrix in solution phase.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In an example, when the carbonization precursor polymer includes at least one repeating unit, the sacrificial polymer may be a copolymer including the repeating unit. For example, the sacrificial polymer may include styrene-co-acrylonitrile (SAN), polylactic acid (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polymethacrylate (PMMA), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), but the present invention is not limited thereto.
