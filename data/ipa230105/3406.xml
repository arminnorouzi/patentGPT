HVAC system <b>10</b> includes HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, a supply air duct <b>20</b>, a return air duct <b>22</b> (collectively, &#x201c;ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>&#x201d;), dampers <b>24</b>, and air filters <b>26</b>. Additionally, HVAC system <b>10</b> includes an HVAC controller <b>30</b> configured to control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to regulate one or more parameters within building <b>12</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a dial <b>32</b> and an analog display <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">HVAC system <b>10</b> may include one or more devices for regulating an environment within building <b>12</b>. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control the comfort level (e.g., temperature and/or humidity) in building <b>12</b> by activating and deactivating HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> in a controlled manner. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> via a wired or wireless communication link <b>38</b>. In some examples, a wired communication link <b>38</b> may connect HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> and HVAC controller <b>30</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be a thermostat, such as, for example, a wall mountable thermostat. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be programmable to allow for user-defined temperature set points to control the temperature of building <b>12</b>. Based on sensed temperature of building <b>12</b>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may turn on HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> or turn off HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> in order to reach the user-defined temperature set point. Although this disclosure describes HVAC controller <b>30</b> (and controllers shown in other figures) as controlling HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, external computing device <b>36</b> may also be configured to perform these functions. The techniques of this disclosure will primarily be described using examples related to temperature, but the systems, devices, and methods described herein may also be used in conjunction with other sensed properties, such as humidity or air quality. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control all of the critical networks of a building, including a security system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may provide heated air (and/or cooled air) via the ductwork throughout the building <b>12</b>. As illustrated, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may be in fluid communication with one or more spaces, rooms, and/or zones in building <b>12</b> via ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, but this is not required. In operation, when HVAC controller <b>30</b> outputs a heat call signal to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> (e.g., a forced warm air furnace) may turn on (begin operating or activate) to supply heated air to one or more spaces within building <b>12</b> via supply air ducts <b>20</b>. HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, which include an air movement device <b>18</b> (e.g., a blower or a fan), can force the heated air through supply air duct <b>20</b>. In this example, cooler air from each space returns to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> (e.g. forced warm air furnace) for heating via return air ducts <b>22</b>. Similarly, when a cool call signal is provided by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, a cooling device (e.g., an air conditioning (AC) unit) of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may turn on to supply cooled air to one or more spaces within building <b>12</b> via supply air ducts <b>20</b>. Air movement device <b>18</b> may force the cooled air through supply air duct <b>20</b>. In this example, warmer air from each space of building <b>12</b> may return to HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> for cooling via return air ducts <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may include any one or combination of a fan, a blower, a furnace, a heat pump, an electric heat pump, a geothermal heat pump, an electric heating unit, an AC unit, a humidifier, a dehumidifier, an air exchanger, an air cleaner, a damper, a valve, and a fan, however this is not required. HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> may include any device or group of devices which contributes to regulating the environment within building <b>12</b> based on signals received from HVAC controller <b>30</b> or contributes to regulating the environment within building <b>12</b> independently from HVAC controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Ducts <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may include one or more dampers <b>24</b> to regulate the flow of air, but this is not required. For example, one or more dampers <b>24</b> may be coupled to HVAC controller <b>30</b> and can be coordinated with the operation of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may actuate dampers <b>24</b> to an open position, a closed position, and/or a partially open position to modulate the flow of air from the one or more HVAC components to an appropriate room and/or space in building <b>12</b>. Dampers <b>24</b> may be particularly useful in zoned HVAC systems, and may be used to control which space(s) in building <b>12</b> receive conditioned air and/or receives how much conditioned air from HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In many instances, air filters <b>26</b> may be used to remove dust and other pollutants from the air inside building <b>12</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, air filters <b>26</b> is installed in return air duct <b>22</b> and may filter the air prior to the air entering HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, but it is contemplated that any other suitable location for air filters <b>26</b> may be used. The presence of air filters <b>26</b> may not only improve the indoor air quality but may also protect the HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> from dust and other particulate matter that would otherwise be permitted to enter HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include any suitable arrangement of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include processing circuitry comprising microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry, or a combination of any of the foregoing devices or circuitry. Accordingly, the processing circuitry may include any suitable structure, whether in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof, to perform the functions ascribed herein to HVAC controller <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a memory configured to store information within HVAC controller <b>30</b> during operation. The memory may include a computer-readable storage medium or computer-readable storage device. In some examples, the memory includes one or more of a short-term memory or a long-term memory. The memory may include, for example, random access memories (RAM), dynamic random access memories (DRAM), static random access memories (SRAM), magnetic discs, optical discs, flash memories, or forms of electrically programmable memories (EPROM) or electrically erasable and programmable memories (EEPROM). In some examples, the memory is used to store program instructions for execution by the processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. In some examples, the memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be able to store data to and read data from memory included in external computing device <b>36</b> and/or memory included in external database <b>48</b>. The memory may be used for storing network settings such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or a Media Access Control (MAC) address of HVAC controller <b>30</b>, external computing device <b>36</b>, and/or a router.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a set of wire terminals which make up a terminal block (e.g., a wall plate or a terminal plate) for receiving a set of control wires for one or more HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> of HVAC system <b>10</b>. The memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may store one or more wiring configurations for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, allowing HVAC controller <b>30</b> to determine which of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> are connected to HVAC controller <b>30</b>. The memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may also store settings for HVAC system <b>10</b> which correspond to the one or more wiring configurations for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>. For example, if HVAC controller <b>30</b> is wired to an AC unit of HVAC component(s) <b>16</b>, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may determine one or more settings for controlling the AC unit to turn on and turn off.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the memory of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may store program instructions, which may include one or more program modules, which are executable by HVAC controller <b>30</b>. When executed by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, such program instructions may cause HVAC controller <b>30</b> to provide the functionality ascribed to it herein. The program instructions may be embodied in software, firmware, and/or RAMware.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a dial <b>32</b> which is located at an outer circumference of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be fixed to a wall or another surface such that dial <b>32</b> may be rotated relative to one or more other components (e.g., analog display <b>34</b>) of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. Dial <b>32</b> may represent a user interface such that processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive, dial <b>32</b> and/or dial circuitry electrically connected to dial <b>32</b>, information indicative of a user input. In some examples, the user input may represent a user selection of a set point parameter value (e.g., a set point temperature), a user selection of information to be displayed by HVAC controller <b>30</b>, or a user selection of another setting. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may smoothly rotate with respect to analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may rotate with one or more steps such that as dial <b>32</b> rotates, dial <b>32</b> &#x201c;snaps&#x201d; into position after every interval of rotational distance. In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may smoothly rotate with respect to analog display <b>34</b> and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may output an audio signal (e.g., a clicking noise) for every interval of rotational position (e.g., every one degree) in which dial <b>32</b> rotates.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, dial <b>32</b> does not move inwards in response to a force applied to dial <b>32</b>. For example, dial <b>32</b> may rotate about a center axis which passes through a center of dial <b>32</b> without moving along the center axis in response to one or more forces applied to dial <b>32</b>. When HVAC controller <b>30</b> is mounted on a vertical surface such as a wall, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may prevent dial <b>32</b> from depressing inwards towards the vertical surface while allowing the dial <b>32</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, dial <b>32</b> may include a set of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) configured to illuminate a portion or a whole of dial <b>32</b>, but this is not required. The processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may selectively illuminate one or more LEDs of the set of LEDs in order to indicate a set point temperature or convey other information. In some examples, the set of LEDs included in dial <b>32</b> may illuminate dial <b>32</b> to indicate that HVAC system <b>10</b> is in a heating or indicate that HVAC system <b>10</b> is cooling. For example, when HVAC system <b>10</b> is heating (e.g., HVAC controller <b>30</b> is outputting one or more instructions for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to increase a temperature within building <b>12</b>), the LEDs of dial <b>32</b> cause dial <b>32</b> to illuminate at a first color. When HVAC system <b>10</b> is cooling (e.g., HVAC controller <b>30</b> is outputting one or more instructions for HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to decrease a temperature within building <b>12</b>), the LEDs of dial <b>32</b> cause dial <b>32</b> to illuminate at a second color. In this way, the LEDs of dial <b>32</b> may indicate whether HVAC system <b>10</b> is heating or cooling.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Analog display <b>34</b> may include information relating to one or more aspects of an area in which HVAC controller <b>30</b> is located (e.g., a room in which HVAC controller <b>30</b> is located, a building in which HVAC controller <b>30</b> is located, an area outside of a building in which HVAC controller <b>30</b> is located, or any combination thereof). Analog display <b>34</b> may be round in shape and analog display <b>34</b> may be located an area within a circumference of dial <b>32</b> such that edges of dial <b>32</b> are visible around an outer circumference of analog display <b>34</b>. At least part of dial <b>32</b> and analog display <b>34</b> may represent an outer surface of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. In some cases, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive user input to one or both of dial <b>32</b> and analog display <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A user may interact with HVAC controller <b>30</b> through a mobile phone, a tablet, a computer, or another device. For example, user devices <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>N (collectively, &#x201c;user devices <b>8</b>&#x201d;) may communicate with HVAC controller <b>30</b> via network <b>6</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may, in some examples, be configured to communicate directly with network <b>6</b> without communicating with network <b>6</b> via a gateway device (e.g., a Wi-Fi router) within building <b>12</b>. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive instructions from one or more of user devices <b>8</b>. The instructions may include, for example, a request to change a set point temperature for an area within building <b>12</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may change the set point temperature in response to receiving the instruction. In turn, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control HVAC component(s) <b>16</b> to control the temperature within building <b>12</b> to reach the new set point.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, responsive to detecting a rotation of dial <b>32</b> while HVAC controller <b>30</b> is in the idle state, HVAC controller <b>30</b> transitions out of the idle state to a set point state. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may change a temperature set point for an area within building <b>12</b> in response to detecting the rotation of dial <b>32</b>. In other words, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may determine that a rotation of dial <b>32</b> while HVAC controller <b>30</b> is in the idle state represents a user request to change a temperature set point. In transitioning out of the idle state, the processing circuitry of HVAC controller <b>30</b> may display the temperature set point for the area within building <b>12</b> on analog display <b>34</b>. Additionally, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may display the temperature set point changing as dial <b>32</b> rotates. For example, the analog display <b>34</b> may show the temperature set point cycle through a range of degrees, where each change from one degree to another degree is reflected on analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may emit a noise each time the temperature set point changes from one degree value to another degree value. The noise may represent a clicking noise, a tapping noise, or another type of noise.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control HVAC components <b>16</b> based on more than one set point. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may determine whether one or both of a first set point mode and a second set point mode is activated. In some examples, the first set point mode represents a cooling temperature set point mode and the second set point mode represents a heating set point mode. In the cooling set point mode, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to change a cooling set point, and in the heating set point mode, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to change a heating set point. A cooling set point may represent a temperature set point for controlling HVAC components <b>16</b> to decrease or maintain a temperature within building <b>12</b> as compared with a temperature outside of building <b>12</b>. A heating set point may represent a temperature set point for controlling HVAC components <b>16</b> to increase or maintain a temperature within building <b>12</b> as compared with a temperature outside of building <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> is configured to receive user input representing an instruction to enter the first set point mode. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> is configured to receive user input representing an instruction to enter the second set point mode. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may enter the second set point mode in response to receiving user input representing a request to enter the second set point mode. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may deactivate the first set point mode and activate the second set point mode in response to receiving information indicative of a user input to a mode button representing a request to enter the second set point mode. Alternatively, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may enter the first set point mode in response to receiving user input representing a request to enter the first set point mode. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may deactivate the second set point mode in response to receiving information indicative of a user input to a mode button representing a request to enter the first set point mode.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">HVAC controller <b>30</b> is configured to cause, based on the first set point mode being activated, the first set point of the device to change in response to receiving a rotation input to dial <b>32</b>. Additionally, HVAC controller <b>30</b> is configured to cause, based on the second set point mode being activated, the second set point of the device to change in response to receiving a rotation input to dial <b>32</b>. In this way, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control one or both of the first set point and the second set point to change based on a rotation input to dial <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, analog display <b>34</b> includes a set of markers, an electric motor, and a pointer connected to the electric motor. In some examples, analog display <b>34</b> is circular in shape. The set of markers may be arranged in a &#x201c;fan&#x201d; shape, such that the markers are spaced along the circumference of analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, one or more of the markers may be labelled with a temperature value such that each marker of the set of markers corresponds to a temperature value. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control the electric motor in order to &#x201c;point&#x201d; the pointer at the set of markers to indicate a temperature value. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control the electric motor in order to cause the pointer to indicate a first marker of the set of markers, wherein the first marker corresponds to a current temperature value. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> includes a temperature sensor. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the electric motor to align the pointer with the first marker based on the information indicative of the current parameter value. In some examples the electric motor represents a stepper motor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Additionally, or alternatively, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may be configured to control dial <b>32</b> to indicate a temperature set point by indicating a second marker of the set of markers which corresponds to the temperature set point. In this way, it may be possible to observe the temperature set point and the current temperature value in relationship to each other on the same set of markers. Dial <b>32</b> may include a set of LEDs. In some examples, to control dial <b>32</b> to indicate the temperature set point, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the set of LEDs to indicate the second marker. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may indicate the second marker by illuminating an LED of the set of LEDs which is proximate to the second marker. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may cause one or more LEDs proximate to the second marker to emit light that is a different color than light emitted by other LEDs on the dial. In any case, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the one or more LEDs to indicate the second marker. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the electric motor in order to align the pointer with the first marker of the set of markers. That is, the pointer points at the first marker and the set of LEDs on the dial indicate the second marker.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> includes a temperature sensor.

In this case, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may change one or more temperature set points based on receiving the rotation input. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the set of LEDs of dial <b>32</b> to indicate a marker of the set of markers based on the change in the temperature set point. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control the set of LEDs of dial <b>32</b> to update the marker of the set of markers indicated by the LEDs in response to receiving the rotation input. Alternatively, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive, from a user device of devices <b>8</b>, a user selection of a temperature set point.

In some examples, processing circuitry <b>42</b> is configured to selectively activate LEDs <b>58</b> in order to selectively illuminate one or more of the markers <b>56</b>. In some examples, processing circuitry <b>42</b> selectively illuminates one or more of the set of markers in order to indicate one or more temperature set points (e.g., the cooling set point and/or the heating set point). In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> includes LEDs <b>58</b> instead of LEDs <b>54</b>. In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> includes both of LEDs <b>54</b> and LEDs <b>58</b>.

For example, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to illuminate a first temperature marker of the set of temperature markers to indicate a first temperature set point and illuminate a second temperature marker of the set of temperature markers to indicate a second temperature set point. That is, the first temperature marker may by associated with a first temperature value corresponding to the first temperature set point, and the second temperature marker may by associated with a second temperature value corresponding to the second temperature set point. In some examples, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to change the temperature marker of the set of temperature markers that is illuminated to indicate the first temperature set point. In some examples, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to change the temperature marker of the set of temperature markers that is illuminated to indicate the second temperature set point.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may receive one or more inputs to mode button <b>60</b>. For example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may operate according to a first temperature set point mode and a second temperature set point mode. In some examples, when HVAC controller <b>30</b> receives an input to mode button <b>60</b>, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may transition from operating according to the first temperature set point mode to operating according to the second temperature set point mode, or processing circuitry <b>42</b> may transition from operating according to the second temperature set point mode to operating according to the first temperature set point mode.

Processing circuitry <b>42</b> may receive a first rotation input to dial <b>32</b>. When processing circuitry <b>42</b> determines that the cooling set point mode is activated, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause a cooling set point to change from a first cooling set point value to a second cooling set point value in response to receiving a first rotation input to dial <b>32</b>. Processing circuitry may control LEDs <b>58</b> to transition from illuminating a first marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to illuminating a second marker the set of markers <b>56</b>, wherein the first marker corresponds to the first cooling set point value and the second marker corresponds to the second cooling set point value. When the first cooling set point value is greater than a heating set point value, and when the second cooling set point value is greater than or equal to the heating set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause the cooling set point to change from the first cooling set point value to the second cooling set point value without changing the heating set point value in response to receiving the first rotation input to dial <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternatively, when processing circuitry <b>42</b> determines that the heating set point mode is activated, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause a heating set point to change from a first heating set point value to a second heating set point value in response to receiving a first rotation input to dial <b>32</b>.

When the first heating set point value is less than a cooling set point value, and when the second heating set point value is less than or equal to the cooling set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause the heating set point to change from the first heating set point value to the second heating set point value without changing the cooling set point in response to receiving the first rotation input to dial <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some examples, it may be beneficial for HVAC controller <b>30</b> to always maintain the heating set point to be less than or equal to the cooling set point. For example, if the HVAC controller <b>30</b> sets the heating set point to be greater than the cooling set point, the HVAC controller <b>30</b> may simultaneously attempt to heat building <b>12</b> and cool building <b>12</b> when the current temperature is between the heating set point and the cooling set point. Performing only one of heating and cooling is more energy efficient that performing both of heating and cooling at the same time. Consequently, it is beneficial for HVAC controller <b>30</b> to maintain the heating set point to be less than or equal to the cooling set point. Consequently, when processing circuitry <b>42</b> decreases the cooling set point to be lower than an initial heating set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may also decrease the heating set point in unison with the cooling set point. Additionally, or alternatively, when processing circuitry <b>42</b> increases the heating set point to be greater than an initial cooling set point value, processing circuitry <b>42</b> may also increase the cooling set point in unison with the heating set point.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control LEDs <b>58</b> to indicate a change in the heating set point and/or a change in the cooling set point as the changes are happening. In one example, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may decrease the cooling set point by two degrees in response to receiving a rotation input to dial <b>32</b>, and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control LEDs <b>58</b> to show the cooling set point &#x201c;move&#x201d; across the set of markers <b>56</b>. For example, as dial <b>32</b> is rotating, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to transition from illuminating a first marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to illuminating a second marker of the set of markers <b>56</b>, and HVAC controller <b>30</b> may cause LEDs <b>58</b> to transition from illuminating the second marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to illuminating a third marker of the set of markers <b>56</b>. The second marker is one degree lower than the first marker, and the third marker is one degree lower than the second marker. As such, a user may view the transition of the set point by observing the set of markers <b>56</b>. In some examples, LEDs <b>58</b> cause an illuminated marker to blink when a set point is changing, but this is not required.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Pointer <b>62</b> may extend along a radius of analog display <b>34</b> and pointer <b>62</b> may be configured to rotate about a center point of analog display <b>34</b> such that pointer <b>62</b> &#x201c;points&#x201d; at one or more markers of the set of markers <b>56</b>. In some examples, electric motor <b>64</b> may receive an electric signal from processing circuitry <b>42</b> which <b>54</b> causes electric motor <b>64</b> to place pointer <b>62</b> in order to indicate a current temperature of the space (e.g., an area within building <b>12</b>) in which HVAC controller <b>30</b> is performing temperature regulation using HVAC components <b>16</b>. In some examples, processing circuitry <b>42</b> receives a temperature signal from temperature sensor <b>50</b>, the temperature signal indicating the current temperature of the space in real-time or near real-time. Processing circuitry <b>42</b> may cause electric motor <b>64</b> to place (e.g., rotate) the pointer <b>62</b> based on the temperature signal in order to indicate the current temperature by pointing pointer <b>62</b> at a marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> which corresponds to the current temperature. In this way, pointer <b>62</b> may point at a marker of the set of markers <b>56</b> to indicate the current temperature of space, and LEDs <b>58</b> may illuminate one or more markers of the set of markers <b>56</b> to indicate one or more respective temperature set points for controlling HVAC components <b>16</b> to regulate the temperature within the space.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some examples, projection LEDs <b>66</b> project a halo onto analog display <b>34</b>. For example, projection LEDs <b>66</b> may create a halo light ring as a cosmetic feature over analog display <b>34</b> of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. In some examples, the halo may represent a radially fading halo which allows set of markers <b>56</b> to be visible along with the halo. For example, the radially fading halo may represent a circular light ring in which the light intensity decreases moving away from the center of the light ring. The light intensity lowest at the edge of the circular light ring, and the light intensity greatest closer to the center of the circular light ring. In some examples, the halo may appear in a translucent applique pattern and/or create an LCD display illusion.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, it may be beneficial to control projection LEDs <b>66</b> to emit light with enough energy so that a user can perceive information (e.g., markers <b>56</b> and pointer <b>62</b>) when the room housing HVAC controller <b>30</b> is dark. To achieve this effect, HVAC controller <b>30</b> may control HVAC controller <b>30</b> to emit light from projection LEDs <b>66</b> such that the light reflects off projection ring <b>68</b> onto the surface of analog display <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, the projection LEDs <b>66</b> may include light sources located on a Printed Component Board (PCB) (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. In some examples, projection LEDs <b>66</b> may be configured to project an optical signal at a 90&#xb0; angle from the target surface, analog display <b>34</b>. For example, projection LEDs <b>66</b> may be located within a housing of HVAC controller <b>30</b> and may project optical signals outwards from HVAC controller <b>30</b> perpendicular to analog display <b>34</b>. HVAC controller <b>30</b> may include a projection ring <b>68</b> which is configured to reflect the optical signals emitted by projection LEDs <b>66</b> onto analog display <b>34</b> by reflecting over analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, the projection ring <b>68</b> may, for example, be a transparent plastic in a ring shape intended to create a halo light ring over a flat surface, such as analog display <b>34</b> of HVAC controller <b>30</b>. Projection LEDs <b>66</b> may represent a set of LEDs that shine in an &#x201c;upward&#x201d; direction.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Optical signals may travel inside a lightguide of the projection ring <b>68</b> facing a rounding surface, making an approximately 90&#xb0; turn of the light direction all around the device. In some examples, the &#x201c;turn&#x201d; of the light is less than 90&#xb0; so that the light reflects downwards from the projection ring onto the surface of analog display <b>34</b>. In some examples, the projection ring <b>68</b> may turn different photons at different angles so that light lands at various locations on the surface of analog display <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the light comes from the projection ring <b>68</b>, it shines over a white surface, reflecting the light towards to the observer. Additionally, the device uses a top plate as a light blocking in order to delimits the desired light halo, as shown in the attached presentation. Since the light distribution may be angularly uniform and radially decreasing, it may create an illusion of a solar eclipse in a desired color. Furthermore, light coming from the hole system may fill a second plastic in translucent red that acts as a pointer and it is used for a position indicator purposes. For example, projection LEDs <b>66</b> may illuminate pointer <b>62</b>. This means that pointer <b>62</b> does not need a separate light source in order to illuminate, and pointer <b>62</b> may, for instance, always be illuminated in a red color, although the light ring is created in a different color. Projection ring <b>68</b> may include four locating pins.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Processing circuitry <b>42</b> may output an instruction causing the LEDs <b>66</b> to emit one or more optical signals to reflect off projection ring <b>44</b> onto analog display <b>34</b>. The optical signal is a first color if a current temperature is lower than a set point temperature of the one or more set point temperatures. The optical signal may represent a second color if the current temperature is greater than the set point temperature of the one or more set point temperatures. For example, if the heating mode is activated when the current temperature is lower than the set point temperature, the halo may be red. Alternatively, if the cooling mode is activated when the current temperature is greater than the set point temperature, the halo may be blue.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a front view of HVAC controller <b>30</b>, in accordance with one or more techniques described herein.
