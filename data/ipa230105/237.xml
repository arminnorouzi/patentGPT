Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Swing chairs are common leisure furniture in courtyards, gardens and amusement parks and are extremely popular in amusement parks because of their attractive appearance and romantic atmospheres created by them during use. When users sit on the swing chairs to rest in the shade, the swing chairs can by pushed to swing to allow users to feel comfortable and cool. Traditional swing chairs can only swing forwards and backwards like a swing and have a relatively constant angle that cannot be adjusted freely during use. In addition, existing swing chairs are provided with two symmetric supports, an adjustment device and a suspension rod are connected to the end of each support, and a shelter is assembled between the two adjustment devices. However, such swing chairs can only be used outdoors due to their large size. In addition, such swing chairs have a complicated structure, and it is difficult to assemble the ends of the supports, the adjustment devices, the suspension rods and the shelter together, which makes the swing chairs inconvenient to assemble and disassemble and makes it time-consuming and strenuous to assemble and dissemble such swing chairs. Besides, such swing chairs are inconvenient to use and difficult to carry. So, traditional changing chairs can only swing forwards and backwards, have a constant swing angle in use, and have a direction that cannot be adjusted, thus failing to meet the requirement of users for angle adjustment, and users cannot have a good relax when sitting on the swinging chairs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The objective of the invention is to overcome the above-mentioned defects by providing a rotary hanging chair, which not only can function as a traditional swing chair, but also can be rotated within 360&#xb0; to change direction freely, is convenient to use, greatly improves user experience, and is small in size, easy to carry, and capable of being used both indoors and outdoors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To fulfill the above objective, the invention adopts the following technical solution: a rotary hanging chair comprises a cushion, a support frame and a base assembly, wherein the cushion has two ends connected to an upper end of the support frame and is able to swing forwards and backwards with respect to the support frame, and a bottom of the support frame is connected to the base assembly and is able to rotate within 360&#xb0; with respect to the base assembly.

The leg tube assemblies are rotatably connected to the leg tube connecting seat <b>19</b> disposed around an upper side of the support shaft <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An upper end of the leg tube <b>112</b> is rotatably connected to the leg tube connecting seat <b>19</b>, and two ends of the connecting tube <b>113</b> are rotatably connected to a lower side of the support shaft <b>111</b> and an outer wall of the leg tube <b>112</b> respectively. Four U-structures that are open downwards are symmetrically formed in the leg tube connecting seat <b>19</b>. The upper end of the leg tube <b>12</b> is sleeved with a tube sleeve <b>116</b> that is able to rotate with respect to one U-structure through a hinge pin. Each U-structure that is open downwards is formed in a lower side of the support shaft <b>11</b> and is located in the outer wall of one leg tube <b>112</b>, and the connecting tube <b>113</b> is assembled on the U-structure through the hinge pin, so that the connecting tube <b>13</b> is able to rotate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the rotary hanging chair is to be unfolded, the leg tubes <b>112</b> are pulled outwards and upwards to gradually form a tapered shape with the support shaft <b>111</b> as the center, the connecting tubes <b>113</b> are driven to be horizontal gradually until the base assembly is completely unfolded, the connecting shaft is inserted into the support shaft, and at this moment, users can sit on the rotary hanging chair. When the rotary hanging chair is to be folded, the leg tubes <b>112</b> are pushed inwards and downwards, the leg tubes <b>112</b> and the connecting tubes <b>113</b> move close to the axis of the support shaft <b>111</b> gradually, the multiple leg tubes <b>112</b> are gathered together to the center to fold the base assembly, and at this moment, the three-dimensional space occupied by the rotary hanging chair is reduced.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To ensure that the rotary hanging chair can be moved and stored conveniently, the leg pads <b>115</b> are designed into universal structures. Specifically, upper ends of the leg tube sleeves <b>114</b> are disposed around lower ends of the leg tubes <b>112</b> (preferably, the upper ends of the leg tube sleeves <b>114</b> are disposed around notches in the lower ends of the leg tubes <b>112</b>), spherical grooves <b>1141</b> are formed in the lower ends of the leg tube sleeves <b>114</b>, and balls on the leg pads <b>115</b> are embedded in the spherical grooves <b>1141</b>. Through the spherical design, the leg pads can be flexibly adjusted to any angles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because the leg tube connecting seat <b>19</b>, the support shaft <b>111</b> and the connecting shaft <b>110</b> are key parts that are assembled together, the leg tube connecting seat decorative cover <b>18</b> is disposed to cover the support shaft <b>111</b>, so the support shaft <b>111</b> is prevented from being exposed, and the appearance is more beautiful and simpler.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To increase the support capacity on the ground, the leg pads <b>115</b> are in the shape of a disc, and the balls are disposed on the discs.
