This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wide range of applications exist for HVAC systems. For example, residential, light commercial, commercial, and industrial systems are used to control temperatures and air quality in residences and buildings. Such systems often are dedicated to either heating or cooling, although systems are common that perform both of these functions. Very generally, these systems operate by implementing a thermal cycle in which fluids are heated and cooled to provide the desired temperature in a controlled space, typically the inside of a residence or building. Similar systems are used for vehicle heating and cooling, as well as for general refrigeration. In many HVAC systems, a reheat heat exchanger may be used to reheat supply air that is overcooled by an evaporator heat exchanger.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below.

For example, the heat exchanger <b>28</b> may function as a condenser where heat is released from the refrigerant to ambient air, and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> may function as an evaporator where the refrigerant absorbs heat to cool an air stream. In other embodiments, the HVAC unit <b>12</b> may operate in a heat pump mode where the roles of the heat exchangers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be reversed. That is, the heat exchanger <b>28</b> may function as an evaporator and the heat exchanger <b>30</b> may function as a condenser. In further embodiments, the HVAC unit <b>12</b> may include a furnace for heating the air stream that is supplied to the building <b>10</b>. While the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the HVAC unit <b>12</b> having two of the heat exchangers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, in other embodiments, the HVAC unit <b>12</b> may include one heat exchanger or more than two heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The heat exchanger <b>30</b> is located within a compartment <b>31</b> that separates the heat exchanger <b>30</b> from the heat exchanger <b>28</b>.

Before flowing through the heat exchanger <b>30</b>, the conditioned air flows through one or more filters <b>38</b> that may remove particulates and contaminants from the air. In certain embodiments, the filters <b>38</b> may be disposed on the air intake side of the heat exchanger <b>30</b> to prevent contaminants from contacting the heat exchanger <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The HVAC unit <b>12</b> also may include other equipment for implementing the thermal cycle. Compressors <b>42</b> increase the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant before the refrigerant enters the heat exchanger <b>28</b>. The compressors <b>42</b> may be any suitable type of compressors, such as scroll compressors, rotary compressors, screw compressors, or reciprocating compressors. In some embodiments, the compressors <b>42</b> may include a pair of hermetic direct drive compressors arranged in a dual stage configuration <b>44</b>.

The operation of the HVAC unit <b>12</b> may be governed or regulated by a control board <b>48</b>. The control board <b>48</b> may include control circuitry connected to a thermostat, sensors, and alarms.

The residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> may provide heated and cooled air to a residential structure, as well as provide outside air for ventilation and provide improved indoor air quality (IAQ) through devices such as ultraviolet lights and air filters. In the illustrated embodiment, the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> is a split HVAC system. In general, a residence <b>52</b> conditioned by a split HVAC system may include refrigerant conduits <b>54</b> that operatively couple the indoor unit <b>56</b> to the outdoor unit <b>58</b>. The indoor unit <b>56</b> may be positioned in a utility room, an attic, a basement, and so forth. The outdoor unit <b>58</b> is typically situated adjacent to a side of residence <b>52</b> and is covered by a shroud to protect the system components and to prevent leaves and other debris or contaminants from entering the unit. The refrigerant conduits <b>54</b> transfer refrigerant between the indoor unit <b>56</b> and the outdoor unit <b>58</b>, typically transferring primarily liquid refrigerant in one direction and primarily vaporized refrigerant in an opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is operating as an air conditioner, a heat exchanger <b>60</b> in the outdoor unit <b>58</b> serves as a condenser for re-condensing vaporized refrigerant flowing from the indoor unit <b>56</b> to the outdoor unit <b>58</b> via one of the refrigerant conduits <b>54</b>. In these applications, a heat exchanger <b>62</b> of the indoor unit functions as an evaporator. Specifically, the heat exchanger <b>62</b> receives liquid refrigerant, which may be expanded by an expansion device, and evaporates the refrigerant before returning it to the outdoor unit <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The outdoor unit <b>58</b> draws environmental air through the heat exchanger <b>60</b> using a fan <b>64</b> and expels the air above the outdoor unit <b>58</b>. When operating as an air conditioner, the air is heated by the heat exchanger <b>60</b> within the outdoor unit <b>58</b> and exits the unit at a temperature higher than it entered. The indoor unit <b>56</b> includes a blower or fan <b>66</b> that directs air through or across the indoor heat exchanger <b>62</b>, where the air is cooled when the system is operating in air conditioning mode. Thereafter, the air is passed through ductwork <b>68</b> that directs the air to the residence <b>52</b>. The overall system operates to maintain a desired temperature as set by a system controller. When the temperature sensed inside the residence <b>52</b> is higher than the set point on the thermostat, or a set point plus a small amount, the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> may become operative to refrigerate additional air for circulation through the residence <b>52</b>. When the temperature reaches the set point, or a set point minus a small amount, the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> may stop the refrigeration cycle temporarily.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> may also operate as a heat pump. When operating as a heat pump, the roles of heat exchangers <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are reversed. That is, the heat exchanger <b>60</b> of the outdoor unit <b>58</b> will serve as an evaporator to evaporate refrigerant and thereby cool air entering the outdoor unit <b>58</b> as the air passes over outdoor the heat exchanger <b>60</b>. The indoor heat exchanger <b>62</b> will receive a stream of air blown over it and will heat the air by condensing the refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the indoor unit <b>56</b> may include a furnace system <b>70</b>. For example, the indoor unit <b>56</b> may include the furnace system <b>70</b> when the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b> is not configured to operate as a heat pump. The furnace system <b>70</b> may include a burner assembly and heat exchanger, among other components, inside the indoor unit <b>56</b>. Fuel is provided to the burner assembly of the furnace <b>70</b> where it is mixed with air and combusted to form combustion products. The combustion products may pass through tubes or piping in a heat exchanger, separate from heat exchanger <b>62</b>, such that air directed by the blower <b>66</b> passes over the tubes or pipes and extracts heat from the combustion products. The heated air may then be routed from the furnace system <b>70</b> to the ductwork <b>68</b> for heating the residence <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an embodiment of a vapor compression system <b>72</b> that can be used in any of the systems described above. The vapor compression system <b>72</b> may circulate a refrigerant through a circuit starting with a compressor <b>74</b>. The circuit may also include a condenser <b>76</b>, an expansion valve(s) or device(s) <b>78</b>, and an evaporator <b>80</b>. The vapor compression system <b>72</b> may further include a control panel <b>82</b> that has an analog to digital (A/D) converter <b>84</b>, a microprocessor <b>86</b>, a non-volatile memory <b>88</b>, and/or an interface board <b>90</b>. The control panel <b>82</b> and its components may function to regulate operation of the vapor compression system <b>72</b> based on feedback from an operator, from sensors of the vapor compression system <b>72</b> that detect operating conditions, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the vapor compression system <b>72</b> may use one or more of a variable speed drive (VSDs) <b>92</b>, a motor <b>94</b>, the compressor <b>74</b>, the condenser <b>76</b>, the expansion valve or device <b>78</b>, and/or the evaporator <b>80</b>. The motor <b>94</b> may drive the compressor <b>74</b> and may be powered by the variable speed drive (VSD) <b>92</b>. The VSD <b>92</b> receives alternating current (AC) power having a particular fixed line voltage and fixed line frequency from an AC power source, and provides power having a variable voltage and frequency to the motor <b>94</b>. In other embodiments, the motor <b>94</b> may be powered directly from an AC or direct current (DC) power source. The motor <b>94</b> may include any type of electric motor that can be powered by a VSD or directly from an AC or DC power source, such as a switched reluctance motor, an induction motor, an electronically commutated permanent magnet motor, or another suitable motor.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The compressor <b>74</b> compresses a refrigerant vapor and delivers the vapor to the condenser <b>76</b> through a discharge passage. In some embodiments, the compressor <b>74</b> may be a centrifugal compressor. The refrigerant vapor delivered by the compressor <b>74</b> to the condenser <b>76</b> may transfer heat to a fluid passing across the condenser <b>76</b>, such as ambient or environmental air <b>96</b>. The refrigerant vapor may condense to a refrigerant liquid in the condenser <b>76</b> as a result of thermal heat transfer with the environmental air <b>96</b>. The liquid refrigerant from the condenser <b>76</b> may flow through the expansion device <b>78</b> to the evaporator <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The liquid refrigerant delivered to the evaporator <b>80</b> may absorb heat from another air stream, such as a supply air stream <b>98</b> provided to the building <b>10</b> or the residence <b>52</b>. For example, the supply air stream <b>98</b> may include ambient or environmental air, return air from a building, or a combination of the two. The liquid refrigerant in the evaporator <b>80</b> may undergo a phase change from the liquid refrigerant to a refrigerant vapor. In this manner, the evaporator <b>80</b> may reduce the temperature of the supply air stream <b>98</b> via thermal heat transfer with the refrigerant. Thereafter, the vapor refrigerant exits the evaporator <b>80</b> and returns to the compressor <b>74</b> by a suction line to complete the cycle.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the vapor compression system <b>72</b> may further include a reheat coil in addition to the evaporator <b>80</b>. For example, the reheat coil may be positioned downstream of the evaporator relative to the supply air stream <b>98</b> and may reheat the supply air stream <b>98</b> when the supply air stream <b>98</b> is overcooled to remove humidity from the supply air stream <b>98</b> before the supply air stream <b>98</b> is directed to the building <b>10</b> or the residence <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>, a heating, ventilation, and/or air conditioning (HVAC) system <b>100</b> (e.g., regulating the air provided to a plurality of zones), such as the HVAC unit <b>12</b>, the residential heating and cooling system <b>50</b>, and/or the vapor compression system <b>72</b>, may be an air conditioning system that includes a plurality of compressors and a plurality of refrigeration circuits, where some of the refrigeration circuits are configured to function in a cooling operating mode and some of the refrigeration circuits are configured to function in a hot gas reheat (HGRH) operating mode, which may be referred to as a reheat mode. In the cooling operating mode, the HVAC system <b>100</b> may utilize a heat exchanger as an evaporator in order to condition air, such as by cooling and dehumidifying the air, and may provide the resulting conditioned air to a conditioned space. In the HGRH operating mode, the HVAC system <b>100</b> may utilize another heat exchanger as an HGRH heat exchanger.

The method <b>164</b> includes receiving a call for dehumidification in the absence of a cooling call (block <b>166</b>). In response to the dehumidification call, the method <b>164</b> includes sequentially (e.g., with each step separated by a few seconds) energizing the compressor <b>106</b> in reheat mode (e.g., at full capacity or <b>100</b> percent operating capacity), energizing the compressor <b>108</b> in cooling mode, energizing the compressor <b>110</b> in reheat mode initially at full capacity, and energizing the compressor <b>112</b> in cooling mode (block <b>168</b>).
