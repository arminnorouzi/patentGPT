relates to a marking body provided for implantation into soft tissue (e.g., fatty tissue, muscle tissue, tumor tissue, breast tissue, liver tissue, lymph nodes, in particular the axillary lymph nodes, or the like), having an elastic, compressible and self-expanding support structure. The support structure is formed by elastic and preformed webs. The marking body has a shape that is at least approximately rotationally symmetric about a longitudinal axis. The invention furthermore relates to an implantation system and a method for implantation.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Implantable marking bodies for labeling tissue sites are well known. As a rule, such marking bodies are designed so that they can be implanted in the tissue region to be labeled by way of a suitable apparatus, in order to remain there permanently or over a certain period of time, for example between two interventions. In this way, tissue relevant to the treatment, for example tissue containing tumors or other tissue abnormalities or else potentially healthy tissue intended to be observed, can be labeled for a relatively long period of time. The labeling effect of these marking bodies is attained as a result of the visibility thereof during examinations using methods of imaging diagnostics, in particular in the case of methods based on x-ray radiation, nuclear magnetic resonance or ultrasonic waves.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">WO 2006/000568 A2 discloses a marker for marking a tissue site following the insertion of said marker using an applicator or cannula with a known structure. What is attained here is that the marker remains at the tissue site to be marked for a relatively long time and consequently clearly marks a tissue site for a subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic activity. The marker consists of one or more wires which are twisted in the central marker section and which may have different shapes at the two end sections of the marker.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A surgical instrument, more particularly a marker instrument for marking body tissue sections, is furthermore described in EP 1 782 745 B1. In particular, the instrument should be suitable for marking tumor tissue prior to the surgical removal of said tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the field of surgical orthopedics for treating bone necrosis, U.S. Pat. No. 8,112,869 B2 has disclosed a manufacturing method for producing spherical cage structures consisting of nitinol. The cage structures produced in accordance with the method described therein are provided for stabilizing the femoral head by virtue of being introduced in compressed form via a channel drilled into the femur, expanding in the femoral head and cavities subsequently being filled with solidifying bone graft. In this field of application, the diameters of the cage structures range between 20 and 30 mm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 9,216,069 B2 describes a marker system for breast biopsy, in which a multiplicity of marker elements are pre-loaded in compressed fashion in an administering tube, said marker elements containing at least one radiopaque wire segment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For breast biopsies, U.S. Pat. No. 8,060,183 B2 discloses, in general, markers that enclose a cavity for labeling in imaging methods. In one variant, the marker consists of an outer hollow body closed at both elongate ends and a smaller permanent marker situated within the outer body. The description goes on to explain that the outer hollow body consists of a bioresorbable material and decomposes over a certain period of time while the inner permanent marker continues to remain in the tissue.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the invention to specify an improved marking body for implantation in a tissue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A marking body as claimed in claim <b>1</b> is proposed for achieving this object. Accordingly, the marking body has an at least approximately rotationally symmetric shape about a longitudinal axis, and is able to adopt a radially compressed and a radially expanded state. The marking body is formed by elastic and preformed webs which yield an elastic, compressible and self-expandable support structure. By way of example, the webs are inter-connected by weaving or in any other way. In its expanded state, the marking body is constricted in a central longitudinal section and starting from the central longitudinal section widens to both longitudinal ends in the longitudinal direction such that it has two flared longitudinal sections which for example may each have an approximately conical shape, with the cone tips being in contact. In the expanded state of the marking body, the maximum external diameter of the flared longitudinal sections is two times to twenty times larger than the external diameter of the central longitudinal section. At least in the flared longitudinal sections, the marking body is formed by 5 to 96 webs in the circumferential direction, said webs extending substantially in the longitudinal direction of the marking body in the compressed state of the latter and crossing pairwise at their longitudinal ends and being interconnected in cohesive and/or interlocking fashion. Extending substantially in the longitudinal direction of the marking body means that, in the compressed state of the marking body, the webs extend at an angle of less than 10&#xb0; with respect to the longitudinal axis of the marking body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a marking body can advantageously meet two requirements: firstly, it offers good ultrasound visibility and secondly it counteracts a migration, that is to say movement of the marking body in the tissue during and after implantation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Should a biopsy, for example a vacuum biopsy, have been carried out before marking, the tissue pressure acting against the propagation direction of the marking body may be accordingly lower or nonexistent on account of an already present cavity. In such a case, the expansion of the marking body after placement prevents the marking body falling back into the biopsy cannula or being rinsed away through the puncture channel of the vacuum biopsy unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An implantation system having a marking body and an implantation apparatus is proposed as a further aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention is based on the idea that the visibility of the marking bodies should be ensured even in the case of imaging methods that are based on different operational principles. Furthermore, the unique and clear visibility of marking bodies should be ensured under the largest possible range of examination conditions and application cases. In the case of ultrasound-based imaging methods, a good recognizability of the marking body arises by way of the highest possible sound reflection of the support structure formed by metal or hard plastic.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the case of sonography with medical ultrasound ranging from 1 MHz to 40 MHz in the B-mode (brightness modulation), the support structure of the marking body causes incident ultrasound waves to a structure, circular in cross section, transversely to both longitudinal ends of the marking body. What is obtained by matching the parameters of web diameter (or width and thickness), web number, web density and web material is that only some of the acoustic energy is reflected by the structure and the remaining part of the energy is transmitted. As a result, a full circle arises as a representation in the ultrasound image. In the case of other structures of this form, the ultrasound energy is largely reflected at the first surface of the marker and a shadow arises in the image.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further feature of the chosen marking body geometry consists as a result of the fact that incident ultrasound waves at both longitudinal ends of the marking body on a in the cross section, a cross can be identified in the ultrasonic image instead of the circle. Both geometries, the circle and the cross, do not occur in the ultrasound image of the biological tissue in this form and can therefore be recognized particularly easily, and can be assigned to the marking body, by the investigator.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case of x-ray-based imaging methods, too, for example in mammography, a high absorption of the x-ray radiation by the support structure leads to good recognizability in the x-ray image. The high absorption of the x-ray radiation by the support structure can be traced back to the metal in the support structure, for example the metal wires or the metal particles embedded in plastic.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the case of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the magnetic properties of the material of the marking body lead to its good recognizability.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageous developments of the invention can be gathered from the dependent claims and, in detail, specify advantageous options of realizing the above-described concept within the scope of the problem and in respect of further advantages.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, provision is made for the support structure to be woven, braided, wound or knitted. The advantage here consists in the economical producibility of a structure that is spread out over an area, which, within the scope of a subsequent production step, is brought into a hollow, double cone-shaped form whose conical tips meet at the center.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, the support structure can be formed by a tube that is slotted in the longitudinal direction and compressed such that the sections separated from one another by the slits bulge to the outside. If the compressed state of such a support structure is its relaxed state, the support structure is self-expanding.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A further alternative for the support structure is a support structure made of plastic, for example a marking body manufactured within the scope of an injection molding method, for example made of PEEK.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The support structure of the marking body is preferably designed in such a way that it is self-expanding and can be elastically compressed under a radial force of at least one newton. If the marking body is implanted in the tissue in the elastically compressed state, the marking body independently transitions into its expanded state and keeps the latter if the tissue exerts a radial force of less than one newton on the marking body.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For implantation purposes, the marking body is initially brought to the desired location by means of a cannula and is then pushed out of the lumen of the cannula such that it can subsequently flare in the tissue. The expansion force with which the marking body kept in a compressed state in the cannula flares immediately following the ejection from the cannula is preferably at least 1 newton.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By way of example, the support structure of the marking body can be designed in such a way that the latter has an expansion force which is more than 40 newtons in a state of the marking body where it has been compressed to less than 1 mm maximum diameter and still is more than three newtons, for example six newtons, in the case of a maximum diameter of 1.5 mm. The support structure of the marking body can be designed in such a way that its expansion force substantially corresponds to the minimum radial force that needs to be applied to elastically compress the marking body.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The energy stored in the support structure of the marking body can be adjusted by a suitable choice of the web thickness of the webs of the support structure or the number of webs of the support structure. The energy stored in the support structure of the elastically compressed marking body furthermore depends on the material that forms the webs of the support structure of the marking body. Accordingly, it is possible to also produce the marking body according to the invention in such a way that a radial force of more than 1.5 newtons, two newtons or even more than three newtons must be applied to compress the marking body to a maximum diameter of less than 1.5 mm. It is likewise possible to produce the marking body according to the invention in such a way that a radial force of 0.5 newtons is already sufficient to compress the marking body to a maximum diameter of less than 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the support structure of the marking body is designed to be self-expanding, the marking body independently transitions into its expanded state as soon as the radial force drops below levels required to elastically compress the marking body. The support structure of the marking body is preferably formed by braided individual wires. Accordingly, the webs of the marking body are preferably formed by 5 to 96 wires, for example 18 to 48 wires and in particular 24 or 36 wires, which each extend from one to the other longitudinal end of the marking body and which cross over one another multiple times and thus form a web-like support structure made of a braided wire mesh with a multiplicity of crossing points. A marking body formed by 12 to 48, in particular 24 braided wires preferably consisting of a titanium alloy, in particular nitinol, is particularly preferred.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The webs of the marking body, that is to say for example the wires, are in this case inter-connected, preferably pairwise interconnected, at their free longitudinal ends and are particularly preferably welded, in particular twisted and welded. To this end, the free longitudinal ends are preferably each located on a crossing point of the support structure, that is to say for example where the wires in the braided wire mesh cross.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The webs of the marking body may also be cohesively interconnected, in particular welded, at the crossing points. However, this is preferably not envisaged.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively or in addition, the webs of the marking body can be twisted with one another at the crossing points.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the expanded state of the marking body, the external diameter of the latter preferably increases continuously in the longitudinal direction to both the longitudinal ends starting from the central longitudinal section, and so the marking body has its maximum diameter at both its longitudinal ends.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative embodiment variant, the external diameter of the marking body, in its expanded state, initially increases in the longitudinal direction to both longitudinal ends starting from the central longitudinal section and then reduces again over the further course to the longitudinal ends, and so the marking body has its maximum diameter at a distance from its respective longitudinal ends.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In both cases, the marking body ideally has the same maximum diameter in the flared longitudinal sections. In practice, the two maximum diameters however typically deviate slightly from one another but the difference of the maximum diameters in the radially unloaded state of the marking body is preferably less than 10%.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the expanded state, the marking body preferably flares in the flared longitudinal sections starting from the central longitudinal section under an opening angle which&#x2014;in relation to a longitudinal axis of the marking body&#x2014;is between 25&#xb0; and 50&#xb0;, in particular between 30&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of a marking body formed from braided wires, the wire diameter is preferably less than 0.5 mm, preferably less than or equal to 0.1 mm, for example between 0.05 mm and 0.10 mm. A small wire diameter in this case has a positive effect on the compressibility of the marking body, which is required in the case of implantation by way of a cannula with the smallest possible diameter. By contrast, a greater wire diameter has a positive influence on the set-up force of the support structure of the marking body. This leads to the marking body also being able to expand against tissue pressure prevalent in a hard tissue, for example tumor tissue.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, it is advantageous if the diameter of the marking body in the expanded state is less than 10 mm or less than 8 mm, preferably between 3.0 mm and 5.0 mm. A marking body in this diameter range represents a compromise between visibility in imaging methods on the one hand and the spatial requirement of a foreign body in the tissue on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An expanded marking body with a certain minimum size offers the advantage that it can be sensed by a surgeon during the treatment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, it is preferable for the diameter of the marking body in the compressed state to be less than 3 mm, preferably less than 1.0 mm. A small diameter in the elastically compressed state or a significant compressibility of the marking body facilitates an implantation of the marking body using a relatively thin cannula, that is to say a cannula with a small diameter. A smaller diameter reduces the risk to the patient in relation to injury and pain, and a stab incision and/or anesthetics can be dispensed with more frequently within the scope of simplified handling. This furthermore yields advantages in respect of application duration and costs.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the support structure, for example its wires and/or sleeve, has been roughened, for example by sandblasting, in order to thus increase ultrasound visibility.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The webs of the marking body preferably consist of a titanium alloy, in particular nitinol. On account of the material properties of nitinol as a superelastic material, this leads to the marking body advantageously independently transitioning from an elastically compressed state to an expanded state after being driven out of the implantation apparatus, in particular transitioning against the pressure which acts against the expansion direction and is developed by the tissue adjoining the marking body. The use of further superelastic materials and/or shape-memory alloys is also possible.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By way of example, a fast self-expansion of the marking body post-implantation, as facilitated by the use of nitinol, is decisive for preventing a migration of the marking body, especially during and after the implantation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, provision is advantageously made for the material of the support structure to not be resorbable. This aspect of the invention leads to the advantage that the marking body which, as a rule, remains in the tissue for a relatively long period of time, does not deteriorate. This also prevents the marking body from disadvantageously interacting with the adjacent tissue, in particular by releasing contents or material constituents of the support structure to the adjacent tissue.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wires of a support structure formed by a multiplicity of wires need not all consist of the same material. Rather, individual wires made of different materials may also be included in the braid in order to optimize the visibility in magnetic resonance imaging or else increase the x-ray visibility in computed tomography or under C-arms. By way of example, suitable materials include titanium, gold, iron-containing alloys and/or nitinol.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Especially if the support structure of the marking body is formed by a braided wire mesh, the central longitudinal section can be provided with a sleeve which compresses the central longitudinal section to a minimum diameter, to be precise preferably in such a way that all webs are directly adjacent to one another laterally within the central longitudinal section. The sleeve has the further effect of holding all individual wires together, for example in clamping fashion, such that a connection of the individual wires at their longitudinal ends is obsolete but may be provided for reasons of redundancy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sleeve preferably is a nitinol sleeve. In place of a nitinol sleeve, it is also possible to use other clamps, for example sleeves made of a different material. Such clamps may also have different shapes. By way of example, the clamps can therefore differ from one another in terms of shape and length. This allows the use of marking bodies with different clamps such that individual marking bodies can also be identified on an individual basis following implantation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further distinguishing features of individual marking bodies can be clamps made of different material, for example clamps that are more radiopaque or less radiopaque or else clamps with different magnetic properties, especially for differentiation in images recorded by magnetic resonance imaging. Clamps with air/gas inclusions may bring about improved recognizability in the ultrasound image.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, provision is advantageously made for the marking body also to contain labeling features, e.g., sleeves of different shape and/or length, in particular metallic or other radiopaque molded parts within the support structure, complementing or in addition to the support structure. Amongst other things, the advantage obtained thereby is that a plurality of different marking bodies implanted simultaneously in a patient can be clearly distinguished, or at least be distinguished more easily, in imaging methods. By way of example, these molded parts can be rods or spheres located within the support structure or fastened to the support structure, and can furthermore have different dimensions for improved distinguishability. By way of example, these molded parts can be formed from metal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A further aspect relates to an implantation system having a marking body of the type claimed here, and to an implantation apparatus.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The implantation apparatus is designed for implantation of the marking body according to the invention and comprises a cannula to this end. Consequently, by way of the implantation apparatus, the marking body can advantageously be placed at the tissue site to be labeled by puncturing the skin layers and the tissue located therebelow, with imaging methods being used in particular. Advantageously, provision is made for the external diameter of the cannula of the implantation apparatus to be less than 3 mm, preferably between 1.6 mm and 1.2 mm. This leads to the advantage that the marking body can be implanted percutaneously, in particular on account of the small cannula diameter. In particular, a small external cannula diameter facilitates an implantation of the marking body without having to resort to a stab incision of the skin at the entry site of the cannula or anesthetization of the relevant tissue.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a result of the overall system, the marking body can be applied together with a suitable implantation apparatus that fits in terms of dimensions. In particular, the implantation system as overall system comprising both marking body and implantation apparatus may in the delivery state contain the marking body already in the compressed state within the cannula, and so the method step of compressing the marking body and pre-loading the implantation apparatus is dispensed with for the user and the application is further simplified in this way.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A method for producing a marking body is also proposed according to the invention. The latter comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0051">providing a tubular braided wire mesh which is formed by 5 to 96 braided individual wires, and</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0052">constricting the braided wire mesh in a central longitudinal section such that the braided wire mesh starting from the central longitudinal section widens on both sides in the longitudinal direction and forms two flared longitudinal sections.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">Preferably, the method includes the following further method steps:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0054">braiding individual wires to form a tube such that the individual wires alternately cross over and under one another at crossing points, the crossing points being approximately arranged on crossing point planes which extend transversely to a longitudinal axis of the tube, and</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0055">separating a tube section by laser cutting the wires at all crossing points in a separation plane, which is a crossing point plane, for providing the tubular braided wire mesh. The tubular braided wire mesh separated from the tube can subsequently be shaped into the marking body.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">Preferably, the individual wires are welded pairwise to one another upon separation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">Preferably, the individual wires are twisted around one another at crossing point planes provided as separation planes by virtue of the respective two individual wires being wound around one another through at least 180&#xb0;, preferably 360&#xb0;, 540&#xb0; or 720&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">Preferably, the individual wires cross over or under one another 8 to 12 times, preferably 9 to 11 times or 10 times between the longitudinal ends of the tubular braided wire mesh. Accordingly, every ninth to thirteenth, preferably each tenth, eleventh or twelfth crossing point plane of the tube braided from individual wires represents a separation plane where the individual wires are twisted around one another, preferably pairwise.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">A marking body of the type presented here serves for percutaneous marking in the soft tissue, for example breast tissue, and for marking axillary lymph nodes following a lymph node biopsy.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The fields of application include the marking of suspicious tissue, the marking of lesions before or during chemotherapy, and the marking of a biopsy removal site. The location of a removed tumor may likewise be marked for improved orientation within the scope of radiation treatment planning.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">The marking body can be used as set forth below within the scope of an intervention:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">Initially, the marking body is implanted at a desired site by virtue of the distal end of a cannula of an implantation apparatus being pierced up to the desired implantation location in body tissue and a marking body being ejected from the distal end of the cannula. Alternatively, the cannula tip of the implantation apparatus can also be brought to the desired implantation location through a port already placed into the patient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">Subsequently, the body tissue can be examined using an imaging ultrasound method, an ultrasound recording of the marked tissue being made. The marking body can be recognized in the ultrasound recording on account of a circular or X-shaped artifact.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">Preferably, the marking body is used for marking in fatty tissue, muscle tissue, tumor tissue, breast tissue, liver tissue and/or lymph nodes, in particular the axillary lymph nodes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

flared longitudinal sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> each flare conically starting from the central longitudinal section <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the external diameter of the flared longitudinal sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> increases continuously starting from the central longitudinal section <b>106</b>. Each flared longitudinal section <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> has a maximum external diameter at the respective longitudinal ends of the marking body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">In the two flared longitudinal sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the marking body <b>100</b> has a mesh-like support structure with a multiplicity of crossing points <b>105</b> formed by webs <b>103</b>. To bring the marking body <b>100</b> into its elastically compressed state, the web-like support structures in the two flared longitudinal sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can be pressed radially together so that the meshes <b>108</b> in the respective support structure close in the direction of the longitudinal axis <b>110</b> of the marking body. The effective length of the marking body <b>100</b> is accordingly longer in the compressed state than in the expanded state. To bring the marking body <b>100</b> into an elastically compressed state, a radial force of at least one newton must be exerted on the marking body <b>100</b> in the two flared longitudinal sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. Consequently, the marking body <b>100</b> is designed such that it exerts a radial force of approximately one newton on the surrounding tissue when in a compressed state and expands should the opposing force of the tissue be less than one newton. In embodiments not shown here, the marking body comprises webs with a web thickness that differs from the web thickness of the webs <b>103</b> such that a comparatively greater radial force, for example at least 1.5 newtons, must be exerted on the marking body in order to elastically compress the latter.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">In the central longitudinal section <b>106</b>, the tube has not been cut by laser and accordingly has a closed, sleeve-shaped support structure.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">The marking body <b>100</b> is rotationally symmetric in relation to its longitudinal axis <b>110</b>.

The tube from which the marking body <b>100</b> is formed has an internal diameter of 0.458 mm, an external diameter of 0.762 mm and a wall thickness of 0.152 mm.

The braided wire mesh <b>1200</b> that will form the marking body <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032; is formed from 24 individual wires <b>1102</b> which cross under or over one another nine times between their longitudinal ends <b>1118</b> and which are twisted around one another and welded to one another at their longitudinal ends <b>1118</b> in pairs such that the braided wire mesh <b>1200</b> has respective weld beads <b>1120</b> at the longitudinal ends <b>1118</b> of the wires <b>1102</b>.

In this embodiment, the wire ends need not be welded to one another since the sleeve <b>1122</b> keeps the braided mesh stable.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0164">To produce a braided wire mesh <b>1200</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, a wire tube <b>1202</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is produced first. To produce the tube <b>1202</b>, 24 individual wires <b>1102</b>, for example, are braided with one another such that they alternately cross over and under one another at crossing points <b>1110</b>. Crossing point planes <b>1210</b> that extend transversely to a longitudinal direction of the tube <b>1202</b> arise in this way. Once the individual wires <b>1102</b> have each crossed one another in pairs nine times, two individual wires are twisted around one another in each case such that twists <b>1206</b> arise. The wire tube <b>1202</b> thus forms crossing point planes <b>1210</b> that alternate with separating planes <b>1202</b> at which a respective braided wire mesh <b>1200</b> should be separated from the wire tube <b>1202</b>. In the example illustrated, nine crossing point planes <b>1210</b> are followed in each case by a respective separation plane <b>1212</b>. In the separation planes, the wires <b>1102</b> are in each case fully wrapped about one another twice in pairs such that a wrap-around angle of 720&#xb0; arises.

The separation sites <b>1214</b> are situated in precisely one separation plane <b>1212</b>, that is to say where the twists <b>1206</b> are situated. The weld beads <b>1120</b> arise from the laser cutting such that the then free, pairwise interconnected longitudinal ends <b>1118</b> of the wires <b>1102</b> are interconnected both by twisting and by laser welding.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref> once again show perspective views of a marking body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0167">The individual webs may have different diameters and also different cross-sectional shapes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b><i>a </i>to <b>23</b><i>h </i></figref>show different cross-sectional shapes.
