id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for assessing a shape of a bell-shaped liquid spray. The method comprises the steps of operating a spray nozzle for delivering a bell-shaped liquid spray and capturing an image of a plurality of liquid jets forming the delivered bell-shaped liquid spray during operation of the spray nozzle. The invention further relates to a computer program product for assessing a shape of a bell-shaped liquid spray.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bell-shaped liquid sprays are widely used for applying liquid coatings onto surfaces. A bell-shaped liquid spray may be delivered by a disc-shaped or conical spray nozzle rotating about a rotation axis at a high angular speed while the liquid coating is continuously fed to the spray nozzle. The fast rotation of the spray nozzle makes the liquid coating undergo a strong centrifugal force which accelerates the liquid coating in a radial direction with respect to the rotation axis. Apart from the centrifugal force, the liquid coating undergoes a plurality of further forces like a viscoelastic force, a surface tension force, a gravitational force, an aerodynamic drag force and an electrostatic force.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to a plurality of radial grooves disposed next to each other along a perimeter of the spray nozzle the accelerated liquid coating forms a plurality of distinct liquid jets when separating from the spray nozzle. The liquid jets are arranged along the perimeter of the spray nozzle at essentially equal distances from one another. The interplay of the above-mentioned forces cooperation leads to a bell-shape of the liquid coating spray.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A bell-shaped liquid coating spray may be used for coating a large variety of different workpieces and is preferably used by car manufacturers for applying coatings onto surfaces of car body parts. Car body parts are coated mainly for an aesthetic appearance of the car and for protecting the materials of the car body parts from deterioration, i.e. from damage, wear and corrosion. For an optimal effect a coating has to be applied onto a surface of a car body part as uniformly as possible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, car manufacturers keep on improving the bell-shaped liquid coating spray by optimizing a shape of the spray nozzle, a viscosity of the liquid coating and a plurality of bell spraying parameters like the angular speed of the spray nozzle and the feeding rate of the liquid coating in order to achieve a higher quality of the applied coating.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a method for assessing a shape of a bell-shaped liquid spray which assessment allows for optimizing the bell-shaped liquid spray. Another object of the invention is to provide a computer program product for assessing a shape of a bell-shaped liquid spray.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the invention is a method for assessing a shape of a bell-shaped liquid spray. The method comprises the steps of operating a spray nozzle for delivering a bell-shaped liquid spray and capturing an image of a plurality of liquid jets forming the delivered bell-shaped liquid spray during operation of the spray nozzle. The method is based on a normal operation of the spray nozzle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">During a normal operation, the spray nozzle rotates at an angular speed in a range about from 10.000 rotations per minute (rpm) to 70.000 rpm about a rotation axis. While the spray nozzle is rotating the liquid, preferably a coating, is continuously fed to the spray nozzle at a feeding rate in a range about from 50 ml/min to 400 ml/min. Due to an interplay of a centrifugal force caused by rotation of the spray nozzle and one or more of a viscoelastic force, a surface tension force, a gravitational force, an aerodynamic drag force and an electrostatic force the liquid spray has a shape of a bell while being delivered by the spray nozzle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The angular speed of the spray nozzle and the feeding rate of the liquid are two important parameters affecting the shape of the bell-shaped liquid spray. A third important parameter affecting the shape of the bell-shaped liquid spray, however, is a viscosity of the liquid and a dependency of the viscosity from an external force applied to the liquid. With respect to the dependency of the viscosity from an external force, Newtonian liquids and non-Newtonian liquids may be distinguished. The former liquids have a viscosity being independent of any external force, i.e. being constant with respect to external forces, while the latter liquids have a viscosity varying dependent on the external force.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">During operation of the spray nozzle, a high-speed camera captures one or more subsequent images of the bell-shaped liquid spray being delivered by the spray nozzle. Each captured image represents a frozen state of the bell-shaped liquid spray and comprises a plurality of liquid jets forming the bell-shaped liquid spray which are arranged next to each other along a perimeter of the spray nozzle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, the method comprises the further steps of processing the captured image and deriving at least one shape parameter of the liquid jets from the processed image. Being based on an image captured during a normal operation of the spray nozzle, the inventive method is an empirical method which is directed to obtaining one or more shape parameters associated with the real bell-shaped liquid spray delivered by the real spray nozzle with a real liquid being fed thereto.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The at least one shape parameter is derived by means of image processing. Image processing may comprise one or more steps of pre-processing, segmenting, extracting and post-processing which are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, a lateral view image and/or a partial image of the spray nozzle and the plurality of liquid jets is captured. The lateral view image is captured when the high-speed camera is arranged such that an optical axis of the camera extends transverse or particularly perpendicular to an outer lateral surface of the bell-shaped liquid spray. Capturing a partial image is sufficient and facilitates both arranging the high-speed camera relative to the spray nozzle and processing of the captured image.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, processing the captured image comprises converting the captured image to a binary image, the binary image comprising a plurality of filaments each filament corresponding to a liquid jet and a plurality of arcs each arc connecting two filaments being located next to each other. The binary image may comprise a monochrome, i.e. single-colored, background which, for instance, may be black or white and a foreground which, in turn, may have one or more colors each color of the foreground being different from the single color of the background.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, the binary image facilitates distinguishing the foreground from the background and, particularly, completely ignoring the background of the binary image. The foreground may comprise the filaments and the arcs which alternate along the perimeter of the spray nozzle. A filament shall be understood to be a thin line.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In many embodiments, deriving the at least one shape parameter comprises calculating a distance between a determined first point of a first arc and a determined second point of a second arc, the first arc and the second arc being located on opposite sides of a filament and connected to the filament, and using the calculated distance as the at least one shape parameter, the at least one shape parameter indicating a diameter of the corresponding liquid jet. The distance may be calculated by counting a number of pixels between the first point and the second point and then transforming the counted number of pixels to a distance by using a resolution of the binary image. The distance between the first point and the second point may be interpreted as a diameter or a thickness of the liquid jet corresponding to the filament. The larger the distance between the first and second points is the more liquid has the liquid jet, i.e. the thicker the liquid jet is.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In these embodiments, determining the first point and the second point comprises both minimizing the calculated distance between the first point and the second point and, at the same time, maximizing a distance of the first point and the second point from the filament, respectively. In other words, the first point, the second point and a nearest point of the filament form a triangle. The first and the second point may be easily determined by pattern recognition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still in these embodiments, determining the at least one shape parameter may comprise selecting a segment of the binary image, the selected segment essentially comprising the arcs only. Recognizing the arcs in the selected segment automatically, i.e. by pattern recognition, is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally or alternatively, deriving the at least one shape parameter comprises isolating a filament, calculating a length of the isolated filament and using the calculated length as the at least one shape parameter, the at least one shape parameter indicating a length of the liquid jet and/or calculating a plurality of widths of the isolated filament along a longitudinal extension of the isolated filament and using the plurality of calculated widths as the at least one shape parameter, the at least one shape parameter indicating a longitudinal evolution of the width of the corresponding liquid jet. The length of the isolated filament may be calculated by counting a number of pixels between a first end point of the filament and a second end point of the filament and then transforming the counted number of pixels to a length by using a resolution of the binary image. The width of the isolated filament at a longitudinal position of the isolated filament may be calculated by counting a number of pixels of the filament crosswise to the longitudinal direction of the isolated filament and then transforming the counted number of pixels to a width by using a resolution of the binary image.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In these embodiments isolating the filament may comprise removing the plurality of arcs from the binary image. Removing the arcs removes connections between the filaments separating the filaments from each other, i.e. rendering the filaments separate objects. With isolated filaments recognizing the filaments automatically, i.e. by pattern recognition, is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally or alternatively, processing the captured image may comprise extracting a filament from the binary image and using the shape of the filament as the at least one shape parameter, the at least one shape parameter indicating a trajectory of the corresponding liquid jet. The filament may be extracted by means of pattern recognition. The filament is used as a whole to represent the trajectory of the corresponding liquid jet. The trajectory comprises a length and a possibly varying curvature.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally or alternatively, a sequence of images is captured over a period of time and deriving the at least one shape parameter comprises calculating a whipping frequence of an aligned filament of the corresponding binary images by applying a fast Fourier transformation to the aligned filament and using the calculated whipping frequency as the at least one shape parameter, the at least one shape parameter indicating a whipping frequence of the corresponding liquid jet. The whipping frequence is a dynamic shape parameter as it reflects a whipping movement of the corresponding liquid jet, i.e. a periodic variation of the liquid jet trajectories, during operation of the spray nozzle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In these embodiments, aligning the filament comprises arranging an extracted filament in a cartesian coordinate system and/or correcting an angle of an extracted filament with respect to a shape of the spray nozzle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cartesian coordinate system comprising the extracted filament allows for an advanced calculation of shape parameters. As the filaments are distributed along the perimeter of the spray nozzle, the filaments are rotated relative to each other by a respective associated polar angle with respect to the rotation axis. Correcting the angle of the aligned filament by the associated polar angle pretends the spray nozzle to have a straight perimeter instead of a circular perimeter. Correcting the angle improves an alignment of the filament and increases an accuracy of the shape parameter to be derived.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, deriving the at least one shape parameter comprises removing an intersecting filament from the binary image. Intersecting filaments join or cross each other. Removing an intersecting filament or preferably every intersecting filament from the binary image may facilitate recognizing a filament automatically, i.e. by pattern recognition, and increases an accuracy of the shape parameter to be derived.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is noted that any deriving of a shape parameter according to the proposed method may comprise averaging over a large number of liquid jets, i.e. filaments corresponding to liquid jets and connecting arcs, in order to increase an accuracy of the respective derived shape parameter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The derived at least one shape parameter may be used as an input for numerically simulating a bell-shaped liquid spray and/or as a verification means for a numerically simulated bell-shaped liquid spray. The derived shape parameter may either be used to increase the accuracy of a numerical simulation of the bell-shaped liquid spray or to verify the accuracy of a numeric simulation of the bell-shaped liquid spray. The more accurate the numeric simulation is, i.e. the better the numeric simulation predicts reality including an onset of an instability or an onset of an atomization of the liquid jets, the more efficient the bell-shaped liquid spray configuration may be optimized wherein the bell-shaped liquid spray configuration comprises the spray nozzle, the liquid and parameters affecting the bell-shaped liquid spray.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally or alternatively, the at least one shape parameter may be used for assessing a dependence of the derived at least one shape parameter from a rotational speed of the spray nozzle or from a feeding rate of the liquid or from an airflow. Taking into account any dependency of the shape parameter on parameters of the bell-shaped liquid spray configuration further improves the accuracy of the numeric simulation and the predictive power thereof.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In many embodiments, the method may be carried out by a processor executing a program code implementing the method. In this way assessing the bell-shaped liquid spray may be automated at least partially which increases an efficiency and accuracy of the assessing process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another aspect of the invention is a computer program product for assessing a bell-shaped liquid spray. The computer program product comprises a data carrier storing a program code to be executed by a processor. The data carrier may be used for installing the stored program code and/or for upgrading an installed program code with the stored program code.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the invention, the program code implements an inventive method. The stored program code enables an existing bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration for an increased efficiency and accuracy. The bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration comprises a bell-shaped liquid spray configuration, a high-speed camera and a computer being connected to the camera and having a processor and an image processing software to be executed by the processor for processing images captured by the high-speed camera.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is an essential advantage of the inventive method that shape parameters affecting the bell-shaped liquid spray and dependencies of the shape parameters on parameters of the bell-shaped liquid spray configuration may be empirically derived with both a high efficiency and a high accuracy. The derived empirical shape parameters may be used for improving or verifying a numeric simulation of the bell-shaped liquid spray. The improved numeric simulation exemplarily allows for optimizing the parameters of the bell-shaped liquid spray configuration in order to achieve a higher quality of a coating applied onto a surface by bell-shaped liquid spray. Another advantage of the inventive method is that the inventive method may readily be based on an existing bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further advantages and configurations of the invention become apparent from the following description and the enclosed drawings.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It shall be understood that the features described previously and to be described subsequently may be used not only in the indicated combinations but also in different combinations or on their own without leaving the scope of the present invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a lateral view of a bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an image captured by the high-speed camera of the bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a first binary image the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has been converted to;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a second binary image the captured image shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has been converted to;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a coordinate system comprising a plurality of aligned filaments;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a top view of a numerically simulated bell-shaped liquid spray according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a lateral view of a bell-shaped liquid spray assessment configuration according to the invention.
