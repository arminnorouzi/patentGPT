The most common reason for buying life insurance is to protect the insured's (e.g., insured individual) income which others are dependent upon (e.g., spouse and children). Financial planners will recommend people buy enough life insurance to replace several years of income where the &#x201c;income multiple&#x201d; is based on the insured's situation (years to retirement, number and age of children, savings and investments, debts, legacy objectives such as contributing to a charitable organization).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">People also purchase life insurance for a specific purpose such as the extinguishment of debt upon death. Burial insurance policies are purchased to pay for end-of-life expenses such as the funeral. Pre-need life insurance policies are purchased while planning their own funeral and the policy's death benefit is assigned to the insured's pre-selected funeral home.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Financial planners and insurance agents consider many taxes that will be due upon death and recommend life insurance to avoid forced liquidation of assets to pay the taxes triggered by the insured's death. Wealthy individuals subject to federal estate taxes often buy permanent life insurance to fund estate taxes. The life insurance proceeds help prevent liquidation of the family's main asset such as a business or farm to pay the estate taxes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Defined contribution retirement assets such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and employer-sponsored 401Ks are examples of assets that create taxes upon ownership transfer at death. In some situations, the insured's death will create taxes that can be deferred over a specific time or until the death of the beneficiary. Federal estate tax and retirement account transfer situations are two examples. Spousal beneficiaries may defer the tax payment. This complicates the life insurance planning since individuals often get divorced, remarry, and/or the spouse's death precedes the insured's death.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Businesses utilize life insurance for covering key employees to help offset the financial impact of a death. Small business owners with other business partners often buy life insurance on the other partners as the means to support the buy-out the deceased partner's ownership.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In nearly all these situations, the amount of death benefit needed is constantly changing. Consumer income increases over time which may require more life insurance. Mortgages or other debts tend to decline, reducing the need for life insurance. Insurance needed to buy out the ownership of a deceased business partner changes with the value of the business. Federal estate taxes are particularly volatile due to changing wealth and changes in the tax code. Congress periodically updates the federal estate tax exemption levels and the federal estate tax rate, making life insurance planning difficult since the benefit is fixed at purchase.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While consumers need life insurance for a variety of situations that evolve over time, the industry offers individual products that have fixed death benefits (also called the &#x201c;face amount&#x201d;, &#x201c;specified amount&#x201d;, or coverage). The individual applies for insurance and the insurance company underwrites the policy from both a medical and financial perspective. Approved policies get assigned an underwriting class which determines the premium rate or cost of insurance deduction from a universal life insurance policy with a cash value account. Once coverage is approved and issued, the insured's underwriting class is set for the life on that coverage.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Fixed life insurance benefits do not align very well with a consumer's need for insurance benefits that evolve over time. The result is an emerging gap between the coverage and the amount of insurance needed. Consumer's needing more benefits can apply for more life insurance, but underwriting will be required. The additional coverage requested may be offered at a higher price because of a change in health or rejected if they have become uninsurable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Carriers require a minimum amount of insurance for a new policy (e.g., $100,000 face amount is a typical minimum). If the consumer does not need this much additional coverage they are forced to choose between over-buying or not buying the policy and being under-insured. Even when small amounts of additional coverage are available, the unit price may be high due to fixed administrative expenses built into the premium.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Using a fixed benefit policy when the insurance need declines over time will result in over-insurance, wasting money on insurance they do not need. Most products are sold on a &#x2018;level premium&#x2019; basis meaning the rising cost of mortality as people get older is &#x2018;levelized&#x2019; over a set period such as 10, 20 or 30 years. Effectively, consumers over-pay for the coverage in the early years relative to the underlying mortality cost for that age. If the consumer eventually decreases their life insurance coverage before the end of the term, the advantage of prepaying for future coverage will be forfeited. Annual renewable pricing structures avoid this prepayment risk to the consumer by aligning the premium each year with the insured's age and underwriting class. Unfortunately, annual renewable term products are seldom sold by agents due to the lower commissions.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Group term life insurance market is one product type with death benefits that partially evolve with the consumer's insurance need. Many businesses provide life insurance to their employees as part of the benefit package. Typically, the employee's death benefit is 1-2 times the employee's salary up to a capped amount such as $50,000. Since the employer is buying coverage on all employees, there is no individual underwriting. Underwriting is done at the employer level based on employee demographics and claims experience for that employer's industry. The death benefit changes annually since it is based on the person's salary. The benefit is a relatively small multiple of the employee's salary and the cap further hinders the benefit for the higher salaried employees. Group term products also may lack portability. The coverage may cease with the employment, a major drawback to anybody with health issues.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The life insurance market needs individual products that automatically evolve with consumer's changing need for life insurance benefits. Automatic increases in benefits without new underwriting would help reduce the coverage gap for the consumer currently caused by fixed benefit products. Insureds that experience changes in health could maintain the amount of insurance needed without the risk of unaffordable premiums or rejection for more coverage. Automatic reduction in benefits when the insured's need for life insurance decreases would offer convenience and consumer savings.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Automatic changes in benefits without underwriting presents a risk to the insurance company but could be an acceptable and manageable risk if two important criteria were met: a) the data used to recalculate one's insurance benefit was correlated to the individual's need for life insurance, and b) the data could not be influenced or controlled by the insured, thus preventing the possibility of anti-selection.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Creating a method and system to automatically change a life insurance policy's benefit must be carefully designed and administered to protect both the insured and the insurance carrier. The nature of the data used to represent the change in the insured's need for life insurance is an important filter in how the change in benefits are administered. In some cases, the data may only correlate with the insured's benefit need in one direction while in other cases the data may be correlated to the need for insurance in both directions. For example, linking life insurance benefits to an insured's income has a positive correlation when the income is rising (e.g., earning more income will likely translate to higher insurance needs) but decreasing income may signal health issues rather than signaling a need for less life insurance. In contrast, life insurance designed to pay the tax on qualified retirement accounts upon death is a dual correlation: the amount of tax (and hence the death benefit needed) moves up and down with the data (e.g., the value of the retirement account).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a computer system and method for administering a life insurance policy with a death benefit that is automatically adjusted without underwriting. The death benefit adjustment is based on specific data unique to the individual and the purpose of the insurance. Furthermore, the methods and systems must consider the goal of the insurance and incorporate adjustments that protect both the insured and consumer from unintended consequences.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments disclosed herein involve identifying the category of life insurance coverage being provided (e.g., what is the consumer's need). The benefit category determines the acceptable data and the methods, constraints, and calculation procedures that will be deployed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments disclosed herein include validating that the source of data meets pre-specified criteria to qualify. The system and method must evaluate the data source, validate its eligibility, and process it accordingly. For example, life insurance benefits linked to retirement accounts may have to exclude certain types of retirement accounts from eligibility.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments disclosed herein incorporate into the methods and procedures when the initial data linked to the insurance need is submitted by the applicant or retrieved directly from the third-party source. Consumers submit a life insurance application with a requested face amount of insurance coverage. The policy requested will reflect how the death benefits will be automatically adjusted in the future. In some cases, the initial data will be known at the time of the original application and the invention's methods and procedures can reconcile the data with the requested coverage and make the necessary adjustments. In other cases, the initial data will not be known at the time of the original application.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments disclosed herein include administering a life insurance policy having a death benefit which is periodically adjusted based on the data uploaded from the insured and/or retrieved from an independent third-party. The system verifies the eligibility of the data and computes the preliminary benefit to take effect on the forthcoming rebalance date.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments disclosed herein include administering the final calculation of the new benefit. The methods and system retrieve the preliminary benefit and apply the specified formulas, caps, and floors to compute the new death benefit. Each benefit category has its own specifications that must be administered in calculating the change in the death benefit to protect the carrier from unnecessary risk and protect the insured from an unintended decrease in coverage.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments disclosed herein include administering the calculation of the new premium for the life insurance coverage due to the rebalanced benefit. The system and methods calculate the updated premium based on the insured's underwriting class, age, sex and other classifications that are established upon initial underwriting.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments disclosed herein include administering the insurance policy and its automatically changing benefits from third-party data sources that may change over time and incorporate multiple data sources for the same period. In effect, the embodiments disclosed herein facilitate &#x201c;portable&#x201d; insurance coverage where the data representing the amount of benefit needed can come from changing or different sources. For example, linking the life insurance benefit to the insured's income requires the system and methods to accommodate the insured changing employers changing over time (e.g., if the third-party data source is the employer) and/or the insured working multiple jobs (e.g., gathering income data from multiple sources). Another example is life insurance being linked to the insured's retirement account. The system and methods accommodate the insured having multiple retirement accounts and/or the insured switching retirement account administrators.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments disclosed herein describe the process of the systems and methods of analyzing a) life insurance benefits adjusting automatically to changes in insured's income; or b) life insurance benefits adjusting automatically to changes in retirement account balances. Embodiments disclosed herein are also directed to automatic changes for life insurance benefits, up or down, linked to third-party data relevant to the insured's need for life insurance. Each benefit category is unique in how the data is utilized, what filters and constraints must be applied to protect both the insured and insurance carrier from unintended consequences.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to life insurance benefits automatically changing to reduction in mortgage balances and other debts. This benefit category has a different risk profile to the insurance company from the other benefit categories covered since the primarily and consistently declines with debt payments. Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to solving the consumer's problem of insurance benefit needs rising and providing coverage that automatically increases with the need without additional underwriting evidence on the insured.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment the computer system receives an application from a potential insured and determines which benefit category being requested. Based on the category assessment, the computer system identifies and records the type of data needed, the insured's particular third-party data source, the rebalance date cycle and deadlines for obtaining the data to process the new benefit calculations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment the computer system processes an application, issues a policy, and determines whether the initial data underlying the insurance need has been obtained. If the data has been received, the system performs calibration tests to align the life insurance requested on the application with the formulas and factors that will be applied to future data received to calculate the benefits. If the data has not been received, the system processes the application while storing the requested benefit determination factors and performs the calibration tests when the data is eventually received. Upon receiving the data, the system will perform the calibration tests and adjust the benefit determination factors, if necessary.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments Specific to the Income-Linked Category Selected:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment the computer system receives an application from a potential insured seeking life insurance benefits linked to their income, reviews the initial death benefit coverage requested, reviews the requested &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019; that will be used to determine future benefits, determines what information is needed to assess the underwriting classification, orders such information, retrieves the underwriting data from the service providers, and applies the underwriting criteria to determine the underwriting classification and premium amount. The method described herein assumes the insured uploaded income documentation to establish a baseline for recomputing benefits on the first policy anniversary. Alternatively, the computer system may establish electronic data feed links from the employer, Internal Revenue Service, or another third-party possessing the insured's income data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment the computer system and method determine the lifetime cap on the policy benefit that may be earned from increasing income without additional underwriting evidence. Factors that determine the lifetime cap for a newly issued policy include the face amount, medical underwriting class, age, requested income multiple, macro trends on wage inflation and mortality rates, among others. For policies already insured but requesting more coverage, the computer system and method may incorporate other variables into the analysis such as the insured's historical income trends and prior underwriting class decisions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment the computer system analyzes submitted documentation on the insured's initial income, retrieves the desired income multiple, and determines the preliminary calculated insurance benefits. The computer system and method compare the preliminary calculated insurance benefits to the approved face amount and determine the new face amount and any potential adjustments to the approved &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019;. The computer system informs the policy owner of the new benefit amount and revised premium.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment the computer system retrieves income data submitted by the policy owner and calculates the benefit amount using the approved income multiplier. If the result is a decrease in insurance benefits, the system and method do not change the insurance benefits. If the new benefit amount exceeds the policy's lifetime cap, the increase in benefit is limited by the total coverage allowed. The revised premium will be based on the insured's current age and underwriting class.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment the computer system receives a request from the policyholder to decrease policy benefits. The system computes the equivalent &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019; of insurance face amount based on the recorded income at the time of the request, adjusts the &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019; and stores it for determining future benefits. The system and method determine any applicable refunds in unearned premium, update the customer records, and process refunds due.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment the computer system receives a policy owner request to increase the policy's income multiple which will increase the total face amount based on the reported income at the time of the request. The computer system and method determine the net increase in face amount to the insurance company, retrieve the necessary information to determine the underwriting decision, and issue the increased coverage at the approved underwriting class. The system and method compare the new underwriting class to the existing coverage underwriting class, upgrading the old rate class if the new rate class is more favorable.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments Specific to the Retirement Account Tax Category Selected:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment the computer system receives an application from a potential insured seeking life insurance benefits linked to their retirement account, reviews the initial death benefit coverage requested, reviews the requested tax rate that will be used to determine future benefits, determines what information is needed to assess the underwriting classification, orders such information, retrieves the underwriting data from the service providers, and applies the underwriting criteria to determine the underwriting classification and premium amount. The method described herein assumes the insured uploaded specified types of income documentation to establish a baseline for recomputing benefits on the first policy anniversary. Alternatively, the computer system establishes electronic data feed links from the retirement account administrator or another third-party possessing the account data.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment the computer system and method determine the lifetime cap on the policy benefit that may be earned from an increasing retirement account value without additional underwriting evidence. Factors that determine the lifetime cap for a newly issued policy include the face amount, medical underwriting class, age, requested tax rate, macro analysis on interest rates and investment returns, and mortality rates, among others. For policies already insured but requesting more coverage, the computer system and method may incorporate other variables into the analysis such as the insured's historical retirement account investment returns, plan contributions, and prior underwriting class decisions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment the computer system analyzes submitted documentation on the insured's initial retirement account balance, retrieves the desired tax rate, and determines the preliminary calculated insurance benefits. The computer system and method compare the preliminary calculated insurance benefits to the approved face amount and determine the new year's face amount and any potential adjustments to the portion of the account insured. The computer system informs the policy owner of the new benefits and premium.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment the computer system reads the reported account data on documentation or data submitted by the policy owner or retrieved from the third-party source and determines the calculated insurance benefits using the approved tax rate and portion of account insured. If the new insurance benefit exceeds the policy's lifetime cap, the increase in benefit is limited by the total coverage allowed unless new underwriting is performed. The new premium will be based on the insured's current age and underwriting class.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment the computer system receives a request from the policyholder to decrease policy benefits. The system computes the equivalent account percentage that is insured based on the requested insurance face amount and tax rate. The computer system stores that benefit determination factor for future use in determining the benefit amount. The system and method determine any applicable refunds from unearned premium, update the customer records, and process refunds due.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment the computer system receives a policy owner request to increase the policy's tax rate which will increase the total face amount based on the reported account value at the time of the request. The computer system and method determine the net increase in face amount, retrieve the necessary information to determine the underwriting decision, and issue the increased coverage at the approved underwriting class. The system and method compare the new underwriting class to the existing coverage underwriting class, upgrading the old rate class if the new rate class is more favorable.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Embodiments Applicable to all Life Insurance Need Categories:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment that relates to benefits tied to other types of data (e.g., estate taxes, small business valuations or investment losses), the general principle of &#x201c;increases tied to specific data/events and decreases that the insured may elect at any time&#x201d; applies in the same manner as the embodiments for income and retirement assets already described above.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment the computer system and method are notified of a request for policy termination either by failure to pay the premium (triggering a policy to lapse) or an explicit request by the policy owner to terminate the coverage and refund premium paid but not yet earned. The computer updates the customer coverage file, computes any premium refund due, and processes the payment to the policy owner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment the computer system and

Embodiments disclosed herein accommodate situations where the initial baseline data for the benefit calculation is received simultaneous with the initial policy application as well as situations where the policy is underwritten and issued before the underlying base data used to determine the benefits has been received. As discussed in more detail below, benefit, death benefit, insurance coverage and face amount of the policy are used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a process chart describing the initial steps and methods that a computer processes when an application is received for a life insurance policy with benefits linked to a specific need and receives data linked with the insured's need for life insurance. The process starts with the system receiving the application in step <b>1</b>. The system scans the application in step <b>2</b>. The system reviews the application in step <b>3</b> to determine the type of benefit category. If the benefit is tied to the insured's income, the system proceeds to step <b>4</b>. If the benefit is tied to the insured's retirement account balance, the system proceeds to step <b>5</b>. If the benefit is tied to the insured's estimated federal estate tax for the forthcoming calendar year, the system proceeds to step <b>6</b>. If the benefit is tied to the value of a business, the system moves to step <b>7</b>. If the benefit is tied to the accumulated losses in a linked investment account, the system moves to step <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, steps <b>4</b> through <b>8</b> represent the gateway to the rules, methods, processes, and formulas that would be applied in that category of insurance. Each step aligns with the policy form or legal contract the insured would have with the insurance company on how the death benefits would be redetermined periodically and other elements of the contract. It can be appreciated there may be other life insurance needs that applicable to embodiments disclosed herein but have not specifically been identified herein.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the benefit category has been determined the system moves to step <b>9</b> to determine if the initial (baseline) data has been submitted with the application, or if the system has the information, the authorization, and the means to obtain the data from the administrator. If the data has been received with the application, or the data can be obtained directly from the administrator before the policy completes the application process, the system can calibrate the requested benefit determination factors to the requested face amount on the application. If the answer to step <b>9</b> is &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, the system moves to step <b>10</b> and instructs the system to go to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for onboarding the application. If the answer is &#x2018;no&#x2019; in step <b>9</b>, the system records that the recalibration will need to be deferred (step <b>11</b>) and instructs the system to proceed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a process chart for onboarding a new application with the initial benefit data submitted or obtained by the system directly from the administrator holding the insured's data related to the need for life insurance. The process starts in step <b>12</b> with the receipt of the application. The system moves to step <b>13</b> to retrieve the initial benefit driven data from the applicant's file uploaded or directly from the administrator. Step <b>14</b> involves computing the preliminary face amount that would be calculated using the data and the insured's requested factor and comparing the requested face amount to the data-based calculated face amount. This process assumes that the application would be underwritten for the requested face amount and the benefit determination factors would be restated to align the face amount with the data.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, if the benefit category is life insurance adjusting to one's income, the insured would request an &#x201c;income multiple&#x201d;. If the requested income multiple is 5.0 along with a face amount of $300,000, and the insured reports annual earned income of $50,000 then the income multiple would be recalibrated to be 6.0 ($300,000/50,000). If the category is life insurance to pay the estimated income tax on a tax qualified retirement account, the insured would request both a tax rate and the percentage of the account to insure. Suppose an insured with a $100,000 IRA account requested 100% of the account be covered for a 35% tax rate, the calculated benefit would be $35,000 ($100,000&#xd7;100%&#xd7;35%). Conversely, if the insured requested $30,000 of benefits and the initial retirement account value was $100,000, the system would calibrate the percentage of the account insured to be 85.71% ($30,000/[100,000&#xd7;35%]).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Step <b>15</b> compares the computed face amount to the requested face amount. If the computed face amount exceeds the amount requested, the system moves to step <b>16</b> to adjust the benefit determination factors. If the computed face amount is less than the requested face amount, the benefit determination factors remain as requested and confirmed in step <b>17</b>. The system moves to step <b>18</b> to review the information available on the insured to perform the underwriting. In step <b>19</b>, the system determines if more information is needed for the underwriting. This decision process is determined by the amount of face amount requested, the age of the insured, and/or concerns raised by the information already obtained. If the answer to step <b>19</b> is &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, the system moves to step <b>20</b> to execute algorithms to retrieve external data on the insured (e.g., driving records, prescription drug history, credit reports). If the answer to step <b>19</b> is &#x2018;no&#x2019;, the system moves directly to step <b>21</b> to determine the proposed insured's underwriting class.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">After the underwriting class decision in step <b>21</b>, the system stores the decision in the customer file (step <b>22</b>) and moves to step <b>23</b> to determine if the insurance company will issue the life insurance coverage. If the application is rejected, the system moves to step <b>24</b> to notify the application, the reasons for the rejection (where appropriate), and any potential alternatives. If the decision in step <b>23</b> is &#x2018;yes&#x2019;, the system moves to step <b>25</b> to calculate the annual premium for the insured's initial face amount and underwriting class:</p><p id="p-0085" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Face Amount(<i>T</i>)=insurance benefit applied for in the application<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0086" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Premium Per Unit(<i>X;S;T</i>)=Base Mortality Table(<i>X;S;T</i>)*Underwriting Factor(<i>C</i>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0087" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Premium(<i>T</i>)=[Premium Per Unit(<i>X;S;C</i>)*Face Amount(<i>T</i>)]+Administration Fee<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0084">T=policy year</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0085">X=age of the insured</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0086">S=sex of the insured</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0087">C=underwriting class based on insured's health and risk factors</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0088" num="0088">The system next moves to step <b>26</b> to compute the lifetime maximum benefit that can be earned without underwriting for the benefit category requested. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> for an expanded version of the process to determine the lifetime cap. The system then moves to step <b>27</b> to notify the policy owner of the premium due. This is communicated to the policy owner in item <b>28</b>. The policy owner may submit a check to the insurance company's premium collection department (step <b>29</b>) which notifies the system to send the life insurance contract to the policy owner in step <b>30</b>. If the policy owner (item <b>28</b>) wishes to pay the premium electronically, they access their online account in step <b>31</b>. In step <b>29</b> and step <b>31</b> the system updates the customer file once payment has been received. This completes the process for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> outlines the system and methods for onboarding a new application without the initial baseline data underlying the policy's automatic benefit calculation. The process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> except the system defers confirming the requested benefit determination factors until the data is received by the policy owner or accessed directly from the third-party administrator. The system starts the process with step <b>32</b> by receiving a life insurance application. The system then moves to step <b>33</b> to store the requested benefit determination factors for future validation or adjustment. For the income-linked benefit category the benefit determination factor is the &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019;. For the benefit category linked to the insured's retirement account(s), the benefit determination factor is the percentage of the account insured (up to 100%). The system then proceeds to process steps <b>34</b> through <b>48</b> which are identical to steps <b>18</b> through <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. These steps represent the process to underwrite the requested face amount, determine the underwriting class, set the lifetime cap, compute the premium, collect the premium, send out the policy once payment is received, and update the customer file.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> represents the methods and system for handling the first automatic benefit calculation for policies processed through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> because the benefit determination factors could not be calibrated during the application process. The rebalance cycle starts with step <b>49</b> where the system recognizes a policy is within the first period (typically a year) and the benefit determination factors must be recalibrated. In step <b>50</b> the system determines whether it is a policy's annual rebalance date. If not, the system moves to step <b>51</b> to terminate the cycle. If it is a rebalance date, the system moves to step <b>52</b> to retrieve the benefit driven data and the policy's initial face amount from the customer file in box <b>60</b>. This process assumes the customer file has received the required data from the administrator (box <b>62</b>). The administrator may send the information to the policy owner (e.g., a W2 form for income data or an account statement for a retirement account) in step <b>63</b>. The customer then uploads a copy of the statement to their online account (box <b>64</b>). Alternatively, the system may retrieve the data directly from the administrator in step <b>65</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091">The system moves to step <b>53</b> to compute the preliminary new face amount using the initial benefit driven data and the benefit determination factors and compares the preliminary face amount to the policy's initial face amount. If the preliminary face amount is less than the initially underwritten face amount, the system moves to step <b>54</b> to calculate the face amount for the forthcoming period using the current period data. If the preliminary face amount in step <b>53</b> exceeds the initial face amount, the system moves to step <b>55</b> to revise the benefit determination factors. The face amount is recalculated in step <b>56</b> using the revised factors. Upon completion of step <b>54</b> or <b>56</b>, the system moves to step <b>57</b> to compute the new premium. The insured is notified of the new face amount and new premium in step <b>58</b> when the customer file is updated (box <b>60</b>).

Given the income in item <b>126</b> ($50,000), multiplied by the requested income multiple of five (item <b>123</b>), the initial calculated benefit is $250,000 (item <b>127</b>). The calculated benefit is compared to the coverage underwritten and approved (item <b>122</b>, $300,000). Since the amount of coverage approved exceeds the calculated benefit amount of $250,000 the policy's income multiple (a.k.a., benefit determination factor) of 5.0 remains unchanged (item <b>128</b>).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0132">The bottom chart on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the year-by-year data for many columns of information to administer the calculation of the benefits and premium each policy year, starting with column <b>129</b>, the insured's earned income. As the insured's income increases over time, the benefit is reset to maintain the desired multiple of the insured's income, subject to constraints such as the lifetime cap and a guaranteed floor. Item <b>130</b> shows each year's income multiple of 5.0, no change since requested (item <b>123</b>) and validated by the initial income data (item <b>128</b>).

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> example, the insured's calculated benefit was less than the initial face amount (which sets the guaranteed floor as shown in item <b>134</b>). In year 5, shown by item <b>138</b>, the submitted earned income and the income multiple produce a benefit greater than the guaranteed floor.

As shown by item <b>137</b> in this example, the policy owner's coverage remains flat for the early years of the policy until the insured's earned income and income multiple justify raising the insurance benefit.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0136">Items <b>139</b> through <b>143</b> refer to the components that produce the recalculation of the insurance premium each year.

Item <b>140</b> represents the load to cover expenses, profits, and the insured's mortality risk assessed during underwriting. In this example, the net premium rate (item <b>141</b>) is 130% of the base mortality rate from column <b>139</b>. Column <b>142</b> is the final insurance benefit for each year after the calculated benefit is adjusted for floors (item <b>134</b>) and caps (item <b>135</b>). Item <b>143</b> is the annual premium in this example for the first year of the policy (item <b>142</b> multiplied by item <b>141</b>). For simplicity, this example did not reflect administrative policy fees or other charges that factor into the final premium.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is another income-linked benefit example except the initial baseline income data is submitted with the application (item <b>144</b>) or otherwise obtained by the system electronically from the administrator holding the required data (such as the employer or the IRS). The face amount of the application (item <b>145</b>) is the same as the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, but the initial income (item <b>146</b>) is lower at $40,000 than the assumption in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> example. As a result, the policy's benefit determination factor is 7.5 (item <b>147</b>) vs. an income factor of 5.0 used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The other initial variables are presumed to be the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (class 1 risk assignment, item <b>148</b>, lifetime cap of $750,000, item <b>149</b>, and the 30% premium load, item <b>150</b>). Similarly, the annual premium rate (item <b>151</b>) is the same as item <b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Given the face amount is the same as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first-year premium (item <b>152</b>) is also the same as item <b>143</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> example, the insurance company approved a $300,000 policy for an individual earning $40,000 a year, effectively approving future benefits to be calculated using a higher income multiple (7.5; item <b>154</b>). In year 2 the income increased to $42,000 which results in a preliminary benefit of $315,000 (item <b>155</b>) ($42,000&#xd7;7.5). Since the second year's preliminary benefit exceeds the guaranteed floor (item <b>156</b>), the final insurance benefit (item <b>158</b>) is set to the preliminary benefit (item <b>155</b>). This process is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, steps <b>72</b> and <b>74</b>. The lifetime insurance cap remains at the level set at issue (column <b>157</b>).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> example is like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> except the benefit category the retirement account income tax upon the insured's death. Item <b>160</b> identifies this as a policy processed through the application queue without knowing the initial benefit-linked data on the insured's retirement account. In other words, the insurance company knows the insured wants a policy to mirror a certain percentage of his/her retirement account (i.e., the tax rate requested in the application) but the insurance company does not know the current amount of that retirement account. To proceed, the applicant requests a certain face amount of life insurance ($40,000 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>; item <b>161</b>). The applicant also requests what percentage of the account they wish to cover the estimated taxes (item <b>162</b>; set at 100% in this example since policy owners buying this coverage would likely seek to cover all the taxes).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">The applicant specifies the assumed tax rate (30% in this example, item <b>163</b>) that his/her beneficiary(ies) will pay upon inheriting the retirement account. Since state and federal tax rates change periodically, and beneficiaries state of residence change over time, it would be impossible for a policy's benefits to exactly match the taxes payable upon the insured's death when the retirement asset is inherited. The methods and system of the invention accommodate the ability to estimate the overall tax rate and change the assumed tax rate over time through the voluntary change process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. There are no barriers to requesting a decrease in the tax rate (which decreases the benefit); increasing the policy's tax rate is the same as a voluntary increase in requested benefit and will be subject to underwriting.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">The insurance carrier will set a lifetime cap for the policy face amount being requested (item <b>164</b>). The lifetime cap determination process is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Note that item <b>135</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> references the customer profile as a key input in determining the lifetime cap for an application. The customer data profile may or may not hold information on the initial account value (e.g., the result of item <b>160</b>). The system and method allow the insurance company to be more conservative (e.g., lower) with the lifetime cap (item <b>164</b>) on applications without the initial data to prevent anti-selection. Alternatively, the system and method could withhold the lifetime cap determination until the initial data is received.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">Continuing with the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the application is processed and approved with a class 1 assignment (item <b>165</b>) and computes the first-year premium (item <b>166</b>) based on the $40,000 face amount requested and the premium unit rate for a class 1 rating. Prior to recalculating the benefits on the first rebalance date, the insurance company obtains the initial baseline retirement account value (item <b>167</b>) either through an account statement upload or electronic feed directly from the administrator (steps <b>99</b> through <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The first-year benefit is calculated to be $39,000 (item <b>168</b>) based on the initial account value (item <b>137</b>) and the requested tax rate (item <b>163</b>) ($130,000&#xd7;30%=$39,000). Since the calculated face amount (item <b>168</b>) is less than the face amount already underwritten and approved by the insurance company (item <b>161</b>), the percentage of the account remains at 100% (item <b>169</b>). If the value of item <b>168</b> was greater than the approved face amount, the percentage of the account insured would be adjusted down to align with the approved face amount (this process is referred to as calibrating the benefit determination factor). In the retirement account benefit category, the benefit determination factors are the tax rate and the percentage of the account insured.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0143">The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> continues with the account value data submitted for the second policy year (item <b>170</b>). The preliminary face amount is calculated (item <b>172</b>) as the product of the account value ($136,500; item <b>170</b>), the tax rate (30%; item <b>163</b>), and the percentage of the account insured (100%; item <b>171</b>). Item <b>176</b> references the new annual premium based on the new insurance benefit ($40,950) and the insured's premium unit rate for that age, policy duration, and assigned underwriting class (item <b>165</b>).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0144">The guaranteed floor (item <b>173</b>) is not applicable in this example since the retirement account benefit category allows the benefit to be adjusted up or down. In practice, there may be a minimum face amount required by the insurance company for administrative cost reasons, but this minimum floor isn't applied for reasons unique to the benefit category. Column <b>174</b> illustrates the lifetime cap staying the same in all years. Column <b>175</b> illustrates the insurance benefit increasing annually as the policy owner's retirement account value rises.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is another retirement account income tax example like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> except the initial application process obtains the initial baseline data (item <b>177</b>) and the insured does not request enough life insurance face amount for the tax rate requested and the amount of the retirement account insured. In practice, the application process will confirm if the insured seeks to insure less than 100% of the account, which is the assumption in this example.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0146">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> the application is $50,000 of face amount (item <b>178</b>), 100% of the account (item <b>179</b>), 30% tax rate (item <b>181</b>) and data verifying an initial retirement account value of $200,000 (item <b>180</b>) as of the qualifying date (e.g., prior calendar year-end values). Data on items such as retirement accounts are changing daily; the system and method accommodates a standardized protocol for gathering data on accounts that will be used to automatically determine the life insurance benefits. Given the initial account value and the benefit determination factors, the initial calculated face amount of $60,000 ($200,000&#xd7;100%&#xd7;30%) exceeds the requested face amount of $50,000. Accordingly, the percentage of account insured is adjusted down to 83.33% (item <b>183</b>; $50,000/($60,000)].</p><p id="p-0153" num="0147">Since the initial account value is known (item <b>177</b> is &#x2018;yes&#x2019;), the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> process to determine the lifetime cap may produce a relatively higher cap (item <b>185</b>) such as $150,000 than the amount illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> ($120,000; item <b>164</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The first-year premium (item <b>186</b>) is determined from the $50,000 face amount requested on the application and the premium unit rate for the assigned underwriting class (item <b>184</b>).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> continues with the retirement account value increasing to $210,000 in the second year (item <b>187</b>). The preliminary calculated benefit is $52,500 (item <b>189</b>) ($210,000&#xd7;30%&#xd7;83.33% in column <b>188</b>). The next year's premium is calculated on the new benefit ($52,500) and the updated premium unit rates (item <b>190</b>).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0149"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates the method and system for an income-based benefit category where the insured's earned income drops to zero. Items <b>192</b> through <b>197</b> provide the data for the scenario. The policy owner applies for $300,000 of face amount (item <b>193</b>) without the initial baseline data (item <b>192</b> is &#x2018;no&#x2019;) and seeks five times their income (item <b>194</b>). Before the first rebalance cycle, it is determined the initial baseline income is $100,000 (item <b>195</b>), producing a face amount of $500,000 (item <b>196</b>; 5.0&#xd7;$100,000), which is well above the $300,000 approved in underwriting. As a result, the income multiple is revised to 3.0 (item <b>197</b>; $300,000/$100,000).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0150">From this point forward the life insurance benefit is based on the insured's income (e.g., item <b>199</b>) and the 3.0 income multiple (item <b>198</b>), producing a benefit of $315,000 in year two (item <b>200</b>). The process is repeated annually with benefit resetting higher with the growth in income. By year seven, the insurance benefit has risen to $402,029 (item <b>202</b>). This benefit resets the guaranteed floor (item <b>203</b>). Something happens in the insured's life, and he/she does not earn any income in the 8<sup>th </sup>and 9<sup>th </sup>year. The loss of income could be health related or personal decisions not to work that are not related to health. Item <b>201</b> highlights the dramatic change in the insured's income. As a result, the preliminary face amount calculated in item <b>201</b>B is zero. Due to the guaranteed floor in item <b>203</b>, the final insurance benefit in item <b>202</b>B is set to the guaranteed floor. The example further assumes the insured resumes working in year 10 but at an income level substantially lower than the income earned previously. The system continues to apply the methods and calculations but the insurance benefit will remain at the guaranteed floor level until the insured's income exceeds its prior highs.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is another income-based example designed to illustrate the system and method handling a policy owner voluntarily requesting a lower face amount. The example starts with the assumption the income multiple is 5.0 (item <b>204</b>) for the first seven years of the policy. By the 7<sup>th </sup>year the income has risen to $80,406 (item <b>207</b>), producing an insurance benefit of $402,029 (item <b>205</b>). The insured decides to reduce their life insurance benefit down to $150,000 (item <b>206</b>). As a result, the system recalculates the income multiple benefit determination factor to be 1.87 (item <b>208</b>; $150,000/$80,406). In addition, a voluntary reduction in requested face amount will reset the guaranteed floor lower to the amount requested (item <b>209</b>). In year 8, the insured reports income of $84,426 (item <b>210</b>A) which results in a preliminary calculated benefit of $157,500 (item <b>210</b>) based on the new income multiple factor (item <b>210</b>B).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a more complicated example of administrative activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates the system and method for handling a policy that requests more face amount of insurance on an existing policy (e.g., an increase in the income multiple factor). Furthermore, the underwriting on the requested increase in coverage is assigned a different underwriting class (item <b>215</b>) which has a higher risk load factor (item <b>217</b>). Item <b>211</b> identifies the income multiple on the initial segment of insurance. By year seven the preliminary benefit has increased to $497,750. The example assumes the policy owner now requests the income multiple to be increased to 5.0 (item <b>213</b>). If approved by underwriting, the face amount would increase to $829,583 (item <b>214</b>). This represents a new segment of insurance (identified by box <b>216</b>) with an initial face amount of $331,833 (item <b>219</b>). The initial premium unit rate is item <b>218</b>, resulting in a total premium of $2,690 (item <b>221</b>), the sum of the premium for the initial segment of insurance (now $497,750) and the new segment ($331,833).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0153">The face amount for each benefit segment is based on the insured's total income but each segment has its own income multiple benefit determination factor items <b>223</b> and <b>224</b>) and lifetime cap (item <b>220</b> for segment two). The process to determine the lifetime cap in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> allows for the cap determination process to consider data that may be relevant on an in-force policy that may not exist for a new policy. In this example, the insured's health has worsened since the original underwriting which may impact the lifetime cap for the new benefit segment.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0154">The bottom of the chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> highlights a potential consequence of the lifetime cap determination process when multiple segments are active on the same policy. At age 59 the insured's calculated coverage is $1,342,403 (item <b>226</b>) is less than the total of the two segment's lifetime caps ($1,400,000; item <b>222</b>). However, the initial segment of insurance is based on 3.0 times income and a $750,000 lifetime cap while the new segment has an income multiple of 2.0 and a $650,000 lifetime cap. Due to the insured's income growth, the initial benefit segment is capped out by age 58. As a result of this lifetime cap, the insured's total benefit at age 59 (item <b>227</b>) is less than the preliminary benefit calculated in item <b>226</b>, even though item <b>226</b> is less than the aggregate cap. Those skilled in the art of insurance product design and risk management will appreciate that the lifetime cap determination process could recognize this anomaly and override the initial segment's cap (effectively borrowing from capacity available under the cap in segment two). The system and method allow for the process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to evaluate the situation and determine if post-issue increases in lifetime cap for any benefit segment are warranted.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0155">Turning ahead in the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart for a method <b>1700</b>, according to an embodiment. Method <b>1700</b> is merely exemplary and is not limited to the embodiments presented herein. Method <b>1700</b> can be employed in many different embodiments or examples not specifically depicted or described herein. In some embodiments, the activities of method <b>1700</b> can be performed in the order presented. In other embodiments, the activities of method <b>1700</b> can be performed in any suitable order. In still other embodiments, one or more of the activities of method <b>1700</b> can be combined or skipped. In many embodiments, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> can be suitable to perform method <b>1700</b> and/or one or more of the activities of method <b>1700</b>. In these or other embodiments, one or more of the activities of method <b>1700</b> can be implemented as one or more computer instructions configured to run at one or more processing modules and configured to be stored at one or more non-transitory memory storage modules.

The independent data specific to the insured individual comprises at least one of: data representing an annual earned income, data representing a value of a tax-qualified individual retirement account. Furthermore, the specific data itself used to determine the insured's death benefit is unique to the insured and source of the data is external to the life insurance policy itself. The data must be retrieved by a computer network or some other means to periodically recompute the death benefit. One example is data representing the annual earned income reported to the IRS for income tax purposes. The insurance need is protecting the insured's earned income. As the insured's income increases, the amount of life insurance coverage that needs to be protected is likely to increase. The specific data obtained to compute the benefit is the insured's own income reported to the IRS. Another example is data representing the value of a tax-qualified individual retirement account, 401K account, or any tax qualified or retirement account, or retirement funding instrument such as an annuity. The insurance need is a death benefit that approximates the income tax liability passed to the account's beneficiary upon the insured's death, adjusting up or down with the taxable value of the account. The insured owns the retirement account or annuity, and it is the insured's death that triggers the tax liability. The specific data obtained to compute the benefit is the insured's retirement account(s) and/or annuity. Another example is the market valuation of a small business held by multiple owners/partners. The insurance need is a death benefit that adjusts up or down to the periodic revaluation of the business. Each partner would own life insurance on the other partners in a buy/sell arrangement. The amount of life insurance benefit would provide the funds to buy out the deceased's ownership for the recent fair market valuation of their ownership. The independent data is the periodic valuation of the business by an independent party.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0157">In some embodiments, the data is independent of the life insurance policy itself. The data used to determine the policy's death benefit is obtained by administrators or other sources external to the life insurance policy being administered. In the example of life insurance benefits linked to the insured's income, the data would be the W2 form filed with the IRS or schedule C of their tax return (if the insured has self-employed income to report on their taxes). In the example of a life insurance death benefit designed to approximate the income tax triggered upon the death of the insured's tax qualified individual retirement account or 401K, the data would be sourced from the administrator of the retirement accounts. In the case of an annuity, the data would be sourced from the insurance company's administrator. Another test of the independence between the data determining the death benefit and the life insurance policy is the freedom the insured maintains with respect to the activity related to the data. When life insurance coverage is based on one's income, the insured can change employers or add a second job without requesting permission from the insurance company. For the retirement account tax category, the insured can have multiple retirement accounts and change custodians without permission from the insurance company. In some embodiments, a variable universal life policy with an increasing death benefit structure has a total death benefit equal to the specified face amount and the market value of the investment sub-accounts. The investment sub-accounts are legally connected to the life insurance policy and cannot be accessed by the policy owner without going through the insurance company. The insurance policy will have rules on when the funds inside the investment sub-accounts can be accessed, limits on funding the sub-accounts, and penalties for withdrawing the funds. Another contrast to current variable life insurance contracts with an variable death benefit is the risk to the insurance company. The insurance company's true risk is the specified face amount which is typically fixed. The rest of the death benefit is simply the market value of the sub-accounts passed to the beneficiaries. Policy owners have flexibility to change the premium funding levels which impact the size of the sub-accounts, but this funding level has no bearing on the policy's face amount. There are two important distinctions to highlight. First, the investment sub-accounts are legally tied to the life insurance policy and filed with the regulators. Second, policy expenses and mortality charges are deducted from the investment sub-accounts. In effect, the performance of the sub-accounts is dependent on the amount of the mortality charges and other expenses since they impact the growth of the sub-accounts.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0158">In embodiments disclosed herein, the insurance policy's death benefit is periodically adjusted by data outside the insurance policy. The size of the insurance policy and the premium cost has no bearing on the data itself, meeting the independence test. For example, the life insurance policy premium does not impact one's W2 income reported to the IRS, the value of their IRA or 401K. In some coverage categories there may be a remote link between the long-term data and the life insurance premium. For example, business partners purchase life insurance on the partners in a buy/sell arrangement. The business may pay the premium which in theory could impact the value of the business since the value of the business itself is ultimately impacting the amount of life insurance premium. However, the relative impact would likely be incidental and preserve the independence test.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0159">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1720</b> of determining a category for the dynamic death benefit based on a life insurance need of the insured individual. The category for the dynamic death benefit comprises at least one of: a benefit of the insured individuals earned income, a benefit of the insured individuals retirement account. In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to the insured's earned income (item <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). An example of qualifying data would be the insured's W2 filed with the IRS annually.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0160">In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to the insured's retirement account balance (item <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). This may include the insured's individual retirement account, 401(K), 403(b) or any other type of retirement account that consists of pre-tax contributions that will be taxed either upon the death of the insured or upon distribution of funds to the beneficiary (for example, if the spouse is the beneficiary under current IRS rules). This category may also include annuities which also create a taxable event upon death in many cases. In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to the estimated federal estate tax liability (item <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Calculating this benefit would entail a combination of specific data that estimates the insured's estate value and the current federal estate exemption levels and tax rates (both of which could change annually if passed by Congress). In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to the outstanding balance of a mortgage or other type of qualifying debt (item <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A mortgage would be an example of a qualifying debt since it has a maturity date, payment schedule and the principal amount cannot be voluntarily increased by the mortgage holder (insured) without an approval process. An example of a non-qualifying debt would be credit card balances since they do not have a maturity date and associated amortization schedule. In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to the valuation of a business (item <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Recalculating the benefit periodically would be based on an independent valuation of the business by an approved third-party. In some embodiments, the benefit is tied to accumulated investment losses on an investment account (item <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The investment account could be a brokerage account, any retirement account, or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0161">In some embodiments, determining the category comprises identifying a coverage category provided by the insured individual (e.g., item <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0162">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1730</b> of determining qualifying data to calculate a dynamic death benefit of the life insurance policy based on the category of insurance coverage. The qualifying data comprises information from the insured individual's income tax filing, or the insured individual's retirement account statement. For the category in item <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data come from the insured's income tax filing. For individuals that have an employer, the qualifying data would be the W2 form filed with the tax filing. For individuals that are self-employed, the qualifying data would come from Schedule C of the tax filing. Sourcing the data may come from the insured providing a copy of the tax filing, directly from the IRS, indirectly from a separate vendor such as the insured's tax preparation service, and/or the insured's employer. For the category in item <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data would come from the administrator(s) of the retirement account(s) listed on the application (item <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Sourcing the data may come directly from the administrator or an account statement provided by the insured. For the category in item <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data would come from multiple sources. On the application (item <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the insured would identify the assets and liabilities, their respective administrators or otherwise source of valuation, any ported exemptions from the insured's deceased spouses, and used to determine the estimated the amount of the estate subject to the estate tax. The estate tax is then determined by the exemption levels in effect for the current year and the federal estate tax rate. These exemption levels and tax rates would be sourced from current IRS tables. For the category in item <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data would be the reported balance on specified dates from the administrator(s) of the mortgages and debts listed on the application (item <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For the category in item <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data would be the valuation of the business determined by a third-party firm that has been pre-approved by the insurance company. The data would be the business valuation determined as of a specific date set by the insurance company. For the category in item <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data would be the reported investment losses on specific accounts listed on the application (item <b>1</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) over specific time periods that are covered by the insurance contract.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0163">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1740</b> of determining a frequency and timing of a data refresh based on the category of the dynamic death benefit and contractual requirements being serviced for the insured individual's insurance policy. The frequency of the qualifying data refresh comprises annually refreshing the qualifying data, and the timing of the qualifying data refresh comprises a time period corresponding to an annual tax filing, or periodic account statement for a retirement account. Frequency will usually be annual to coincide with the normal process of sending policy owners annual statements. For the coverage category tied to earned income, an annual frequency aligns with the annual submission of tax returns. Some coverage categories may utilize a frequency more often than annually. For example, the category identified in item <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) seeks a death benefit that resets periodically to the income tax liability of a qualified retirement account. Since qualified retirement account values are constantly changing due to contributions and market performance, the consumer may prefer the benefit be redetermined more frequently (e.g., quarterly, or semi-annually) to better align the coverage with the constantly changing tax liability. Some coverage categories may utilize a frequency less than annual, perhaps every two or three years, due to the cost or complexity of updating the qualifying data. One example is the complexity of estimating the value of the insured's estate (category identified by item <b>5</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Estates own assets such as homes and other property that may not have readily accessible market values. Another example is the business valuation category (item <b>7</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The cost of obtaining an independent valuation of a privately held small business may outweigh the benefits of having a life insurance policy closely tracking the insurance need. This category may call for a frequency of redetermining the benefit every 2, 3 or even 5 years.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0164">Timing refers to the precise &#x201c;as of&#x201d; date during the year for capturing the data when it is available and factoring in adequate time for processing the changes and notifying the insured of the new benefit and premium required. As a result, the timing is dependent on both the coverage category (e.g., when is the data required for that category available for capture) as well as the individual policy's annual anniversary date. When the policy anniversary date&#x2014;e.g., the date when the benefit changes are scheduled to be recomputed and take effect&#x2014;are too close to the data's availability, some policies will need to be processed on greater lag time than others. For income category (item <b>3</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the qualifying data is the annual tax filing. The timing of the data availability impacts the administrative process. Policies with a January anniversary date will not have access to the prior calendar year tax filing as the employer may not have completed the W2 form and/or the insured has not completed their own tax return (in the case of the Schedule C for self-employed individuals). Therefore, policies purchasing during the first three months during the year will likely base their new death benefits on calendar year data 12 to 15 months prior. For other policies, the timing of the data may refer to the calendar year most recently closed due to when the data becomes availability. For the retirement account tax category (item <b>4</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the timing of the data may be linked to a year-end statement due to its common distribution to clients by all asset account administrators. Alternatively, retirement account administrators typically provide calendar quarter-end statements to client. If the frequency of the benefit rebalance was quarterly, the timing of the data gather may be based on availability of quarter-end data. In contract, insurance company annuity products are also retirement account instruments that create a tax liability upon death. However, annuity administrators provide annual statements to policy owners based on the policy's anniversary date. Lacking calendar quarter-end or year-end statements may impact timing of data availability for processing death benefit changes on a life insurance policy separate and independent from an annuity.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0165">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1750</b> of retrieving data specific to the category of insurance on the insured individual seeking life insurance coverage to recompute a death benefit. In some embodiments, retrieving the data specific to the category of insurance on the insured individual seeking life insurance coverage to recompute a death benefit, further comprises retrieving income data from at least one of a tax filing or W2 form, or retirement account statement. In some embodiments, the data specific to the category can include at least one of the following: income data from a tax filing and/or W2 form for the category identified in item <b>3</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; data on the value of a retirement account from the account's administrator for the category identified in item <b>4</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; data on the value of listed assets and liabilities on the insured's estate (from the respective administrators or independent appraiser for illiquid assets) and federal estate exemption thresholds and tax rates from the IRS; outstanding mortgage and debt balance from the respective administrators for the category identified in item <b>6</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; the valuation of a business from an independent appraiser that is pre-approved by the insurance company for the category in item <b>7</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; the amount of accumulated losses on an investment account from the administrator of each listed investment or retirement account covered under the policy for the category in item <b>8</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0166">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1760</b> of retrieving rules and limitations on changes to the life insurance policy's recomputed death benefit specific to the category of coverage and that policy's particular circumstances. The rules and limitations comprise: functions and metrics corresponding to an income multiple and a calibrating variable. This refers to formulas and variables that are applied to the data received for the specific insurance coverage category on the insured to determine the policy death benefit for the forthcoming period. In the earned income category, one variable is the &#x201c;income multiple&#x201d;. Before limitations are imposed on the upside or downside change in the benefit amount, the benefit would be determined as a multiplication of the insured's income (e.g., the qualifying data for the appropriate calendar year) and the &#x201c;income multiple&#x201d;. For example, if the income multiple is 10.0 and the reported income was $50,000 then the benefit would be preliminarily set to $500,000 (10.0&#xd7;$50,000). In the retirement account tax category, two variables are the tax rate (requested on the application) and the percentage of the account insured. Before any limitations are applied, the benefit amount would be determined as a multiplication of the retirement account value on the specified date, the tax rate and percentage insured. Typically, the percentage insured will be 100% but the insured could decide to insure less than 100% and/or certain events cause the ratio to be less than 100%. An example of a rule is highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, step <b>9</b>. There are different procedural paths depending on whether the initial application is submitted with the qualifying data (e.g., a copy of the insured's tax return or W2, or a copy of the required account statement for a retirement account).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0167">If the application is received with the data, or the data can be retrieved from the administrator during the application process, the rule is to determine the calibrating variables in step <b>10</b> and proceed to the process outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. An example of a &#x2018;calibrating variable&#x2019; is determining the &#x2018;income multiple&#x2019; for a policy based on the initial requested face amount (death benefit) of the policy and the insured's income.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0168">If the application is received without the data and it cannot be retrieved from the administrator during the application process, the rule is to proceed to step <b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the application process without knowing the calibrating variables. If the policy is approved, the policy will be issued without knowing the calibrating variables for the first reset point at that time. The data will need to be retrieved before the first reset so the calibrating variable can be determined and used in calculating the death benefit for the next coverage period.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0169">Limitations in the recalculated death benefit each period are designed to protect the insured from unwarranted reductions in benefits, and the insurance company from too much risk with increasing benefits without underwriting. The type of limitation is specific to the category of coverage which links to the nature of the need for the life insurance. For example, the category protecting the income has a limitation that the benefit cannot be reduced automatically in the event the insured's income declines. This protects the insured from losing life insurance at a time their income could be decreasing due to health reasons (e.g., precisely the point in the life that coverage is most needed). Step <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> compares the computed benefit based on the income data to their current benefit. With the limitation that the coverage cannot automatically decrease for this category of coverage, step <b>70</b> instructs the system to leave the benefit unchanged in step <b>71</b> if the data would otherwise reset the benefit lower. A limitation on the increase in benefits available without underwriting (e.g., automatic increase) is placed in step <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. For each policy, a lifetime cap will be determined that sets an upper bound on the benefits. Additional benefits above this cap may be earned but the insured will need to be underwritten to reset the lifetime cap higher. In contrast to the example above, the retirement account tax coverage does not have a downside limitation. If a retirement account decreases 50%, the tax liability also decreases (hence the reduced need for life insurance for this purpose). Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> outlines the administrative procedures and there are no limitations that prevent the death benefit from automatically being reset lower should the retirement account value decrease. However, there is a limitation on the upside benefit (step <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) similar with the earned income category. Over time the growth in an insured's retirement account(s) could significantly increase the death benefit (tax liability). The insurance company will need to manage its risk and set a limit on how much additional coverage it is willing to automatically grant the insured as their retirement account balance increases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> outlines the process for determining the lifetime cap for any category of life insurance coverage. Since the life insurance application could be a brand-new policy or a voluntary request for more coverage on an existing policy, step <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> identifies the different procedural paths necessary to determine the lifetime cap. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is the general determination process that can be applied to any of the coverage categories identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The growth rate in benefits automatically produced based on the independent data will vary by the coverage category, age of insured, absolute size of the starting coverage, and any number of other variables.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0170">In some embodiments, the rules are retrieved from memory of the computing device for each category of coverage by contract type and issue date, and the limitations are retrieved from the memory of the computing device when the computer system processes a periodic redetermination of the benefits.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0171">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1770</b> of determining a life insurance policy's revised death benefit, automatically and without new underwriting. In some embodiments, determining the life insurance policy's revised death benefit further comprises: 1) determining if the current date aligns with the policy's periodic rebalance date (See step <b>67</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and step <b>86</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>); 2) retrieving the policy's benefit determination data and other factors from the insured individual's file to compute the revised death benefit (See step <b>69</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and step <b>88</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>); 3) determining the preliminary new death benefit based on the insured's data and other factors (the first process in step <b>70</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and step <b>89</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>); and 4) determining the new death benefit to the preliminary benefit based on the preliminary benefit satisfying an upward limitation tests and a downward limitation test. The computer applies any limitations on decreases in the death benefit as applicable to the policy's category of coverage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates the income-based coverage (item <b>3</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) where a downward adjustment limitation applies. In step <b>70</b> the computer compares the preliminary death benefit to the current death benefit (a.k.a. face amount). Due to the limitation for this category of insurance, if the preliminary benefit is lower than the current benefit the system moves to step <b>71</b> to set the death benefit for the next period to be the same as the prior period. The process for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> applies to the retirement account income tax category (item <b>4</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) where no downward limitation applies. The computer checks if any upward adjustment limitations apply. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> the system moves to step <b>72</b> to check on this limitation. The same check is done in step <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> for that coverage category. In both examples, if the preliminary death benefit exceeds that policy's maximum, the computer sets the new death benefit to be equal to the cap in steps <b>73</b> and <b>91</b>, respectively, for the different types of coverage. If the preliminary benefit passes both the upward and downward limitation tests for its applicable coverage category, the computer system sets the new death benefit to the preliminary benefit. For the income-based category in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, step <b>74</b> handles this process. For the retirement account tax category in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>Ab</figref>, step <b>92</b> handles this process.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0172">In many embodiments, method <b>1700</b> can comprise an activity <b>1780</b> of servicing the life insurance policy with a death benefit that is dynamically redetermined periodically based on independent data unique to the category of insurance coverage and specific to the individual seeking life insurance benefits changing dynamically as represented by the independent data. Servicing the life insurance policy further comprises a new premium for each policy based on the insured individual's underwriting class and new benefit amount. Computing the new premium for each policy is based on the insured's underwriting class and new benefit amount. Unlike many traditional term insurance policies where the death benefit is fixed and the premium is fixed at the same level for 10, 20 or 30 years, a life insurance policy that has a death benefit changing periodically (e.g., annually) based on independent data unique to the insured and unknown in advance, the premium will need to be recomputed every time the death benefit changes. For the income-based category illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the new premium is computed in step <b>75</b>. For the retirement account tax category illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the new premium is computed in step <b>93</b>. Notifying the policy owner of the new benefit amount and the change in premium. This is processed in steps <b>77</b> and <b>95</b>, respectively, for the two categories illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>. Delivering annual statements to customers which typically include a summary of benefits for the prior year, premiums paid, and beneficiaries of record. The annual statement servicing will also need to communicate information unique to the policy such as lifetime caps that may be impacting their growth in benefits, the factors used to determine their benefits (such as the income multiple factor for the income-based category of insurance), the official data of record that was used to compute the benefits. The annual statement may also include reminders on deadlines when documentation must be submitted for the next benefit redetermination (if the system cannot retrieve any qualifying data directly from an administrator and instead, must rely on the insured submitting copies of account statements, tax returns, W2 forms, etc). Collecting premium and applying credit to the insured's account. This is highlighted in steps <b>80</b> and <b>97</b>, respectively, for the two categories of coverage illustrated. Handling a customer change request such as voluntary increase in face amount whereby benefits wish to be increased above the amount that is automatically determined by the insured's qualifying data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>104</b>. Handling a customer change request such as a voluntary decrease in face amount. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>126</b>. Handling a customer request to change the policy beneficiary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>131</b>. Handling a policy termination triggered by a premium not being paid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>150</b>. Handling a customer's request to terminate their policy. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>153</b>. Handling a death claim involves retrieving the most current death benefit, paying the claim and updating the customer file. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates this process starting with step <b>155</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0173">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in several embodiments, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> can at least partially perform the method <b>1700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.
