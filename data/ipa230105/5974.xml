Cross-sectional Structure of Imaging Element Package]</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">First, the cross-sectional structure of an imaging element package according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an explanatory view outlining the cross-sectional structure of the imaging element package according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The imaging element package according to the present disclosure is, for example, an imaging device mounted in a smartphone or a tablet terminal. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an imaging element package <b>1</b> includes a circuit board <b>2</b>, a bump <b>3</b>, a dam material <b>4</b>, an imaging element substrate <b>5</b>, a frame body <b>6</b>, a light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b>, and a filling member <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The circuit board <b>2</b> is formed of, for example, ceramic. A circuit pattern to be connected to the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is formed on the circuit board <b>2</b>. Note that the circuit board <b>2</b> is not limited to a ceramic substrate, and may be, for example, another substrate such as an organic substrate and a flexible substrate.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The bump <b>3</b> is formed of, for example, solder. The bump <b>3</b> electrically connects a circuit pattern formed on the circuit board <b>2</b> and a circuit pattern formed on the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>. The dam material <b>4</b> is formed of, for example, epoxy resin. The dam material <b>4</b> fixes the frame body <b>6</b> on the circuit board <b>2</b>, and prevents the filling member <b>8</b> from leaking to the outside of the imaging element package <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is stacked on the circuit board <b>2</b> via the bump <b>3</b>. The imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is formed of, for example, silicon, and has a rectangular shape in plan view. The imaging element substrate <b>5</b> includes a pixel array in which a plurality of photoelectric conversion elements serving as imaging pixels is arranged in a matrix on a light receiving surface (here, upper surface) on a light incident side.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each photoelectric conversion element photoelectrically converts incident light into a signal charge in accordance with an amount of received incident light, and outputs the signal charge as a pixel signal indicating a level of the luminance of an imaging pixel. Furthermore, the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> includes a peripheral circuit, which performs signal processing on a pixel signal, around the pixel array.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The frame body <b>6</b> is formed of, for example, ceramic. The frame body <b>6</b> is stacked on the circuit board <b>2</b> via the bump <b>3</b> and the dam material <b>4</b>. The frame body <b>6</b> has a frame shape in plan view. Note that the frame body <b>6</b> may be a ceramic frame without substrate wiring. Furthermore, the material of the frame body <b>6</b> is not limited to ceramic. For example, an organic substrate and a metal plate may be used as the material of the frame body <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is formed of a material having higher heat resistance than the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>, and is stacked on the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>. The light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> includes, for example, an infrared cut filter substrate formed of glass. Note that a specific configuration example of the light- transmissive substrate <b>7</b> will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A to <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The imaging element substrate <b>5</b> and the light- transmissive substrate <b>7</b> are housed in a region surrounded by the frame body <b>6</b> on the circuit board <b>2</b>. In this state, the height position of the upper surface serving as a light receiving surface of the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is lower than the height position of the upper surface of the frame body <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The filling member <b>8</b> is formed of, for example, thermosetting resin such as epoxy resin. The space between the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> and the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> and the frame body <b>6</b> is filled with the filling member <b>8</b>. The filling member <b>8</b> prevents occurrence of disconnection between the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> and the circuit board <b>2</b>, for example, when the imaging element package <b>1</b> receives an impact.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, in a common imaging element package, the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> including the infrared cut filter substrate is stacked not on the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> but on the frame body <b>6</b>. Thus, in a common imaging element package, when the area of the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> increases with the expansion of a light receiving region, the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is warped by heat treatment included in a manufacturing process, which reduces quality. Furthermore, since in a common imaging element package, the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is stacked on the frame body <b>6</b>, the thickness of the entire package increases by the thickness of the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b>, which prevents reduction in height.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In contrast, in the imaging element package <b>1</b> according to the present disclosure, the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is stacked not on the frame body <b>6</b> but on the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>. Then, as described above, the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is formed of a material having higher heat resistance than the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As a result, in the imaging element package <b>1</b>, when heat treatment is performed in a manufacturing process, in which only the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is provided, at a temperature at which the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> is warped, the occurrence of the warpage can be inhibited by correcting the warpage of the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> with the light- transmissive substrate <b>7</b>, which is hardly deformed by heat.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, in the imaging element package <b>1</b>, the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> and the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> are housed in a region surrounded by the frame body <b>6</b> on the circuit board <b>2</b>. As a result, in the imaging element package <b>1</b>, the upper surface position of the light- transmissive substrate <b>7</b> can be lowered below the upper surface position of the frame body <b>6</b>, so that the height can be more reduced than that of a common imaging element package in which the light-transmissive substrate <b>7</b> is stacked on the frame body <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">[<b>2</b>. Manufacturing Process of Imaging Element Package]</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a manufacturing process of the imaging element package according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> are cross- sectional explanatory views illustrating the manufacturing process of the imaging element package according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, when the imaging element package <b>1</b> is manufactured, first, the circuit board <b>2</b> is bonded to a support substrate <b>100</b>. Here, in a manufacturing process of a common imaging element package, a sticky resin body is used as a support substrate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sticky resin body has a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of approximately 360 [ppm/&#xb0; C.]. In contrast, the circuit board <b>2</b> made of ceramic has a CTE of approximately 5 [ppm/&#xb0; C.]. As described above, the sticky resin body has a CTE much larger than that of the circuit board <b>2</b>. Thus, the sticky resin body used as a support substrate may increase an amount of warpage of the circuit board <b>2</b> in the subsequent heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, in the present disclosure, the support substrate <b>100</b> formed of a material having a CTE with a difference of several tens ppm/&#xb0; C. or less from the CTE of the circuit board <b>2</b> is used. For example, the support substrate <b>100</b> formed of polyimide is used. Polyimide has a CTE of approximately 27 [ppm/&#xb0; C.] and the CTE is closer to the CTE of the circuit board <b>2</b> than to that of the sticky resin body. As a result, according to the present disclosure, the amount of warpage of the circuit board <b>2</b> due to the subsequent heat treatment can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, for example, a solder printing device <b>101</b> forms the bump <b>3</b> at a predetermined position of the circuit board <b>2</b>.

The frame body <b>6</b> is stacked on the circuit board <b>2</b> via the bump <b>3</b> and the dam material <b>4</b> so as to surround the imaging element substrate <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is placed in a heat treatment device <b>103</b>. Reflow is performed at 150 to 170[&#xb0; C.] for a predetermined period of time. The bump <b>3</b> is melted to electrically connect the circuit board <b>2</b> and the imaging element substrate <b>5</b> with each other.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">At this time, the circuit board <b>2</b> is heat-treated, but warpage is inhibited since the circuit board <b>2</b> is bonded to the support substrate <b>100</b>, which is formed of polyimide having a CTE close to the CTE of the circuit board <b>2</b> as described above.
