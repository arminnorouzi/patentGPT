Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to sanitary articles with biocompostable properties, including disposable baby diapers, adult incontinence products, and menstrual pads. Particularly, the present invention relates to sanitary articles with elements that include high bioderived content, including absorbent cores with superabsorbent properties and high biocompatibility.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sanitary absorbent articles are used for a variety of hygienic purposes, including infant and adult incontinence and menstruation. Articles are traditionally constructed with a variety of layers that aid in the distribution and absorption of fluids while providing comfort to a user. Often, the hygienic articles are constructed with layers and absorbent materials, such as superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), that are synthetically derived, are non-biodegradable, and are non-biocompostable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consumers have expressed an increased desire for biodegradability and/or biocompostability in absorbent sanitary articles. As such, biopolymers and bio-derived polymers for integration in the absorbent articles have been examined for their absorbency properties, including naturally occurring materials and their derivatives, such as starches, celluloses, and polysaccharides. However, these biopolymers are often more difficult to synthesize, more expensive to make, and have inferior absorption properties relative to traditional, non-biocompostable materials, such as polyacrylates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of relevant prior art documents include the following:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Patent Publication No. 20180153746 for &#x201c;Biodegradable sanitary articles with higher biobased content&#x201d; by inventor Sookraj, filed Dec. 6, 2016, and published Jun. 7, 2018, is directed to sanitary articles such as disposable diapers, adult incontinent pads, feminine hygiene products, and sanitary napkins comprised of biodegradable polymers with higher biobased content. The sanitary articles include a topsheet, an absorbent core, and a backsheet. The topsheet is comprised of biodegradable polyester polyol polymer foam which may be configured to wick liquid away from a wearer's body and may be impregnated with superabsorbent polymer. The absorbent core may be comprised of superabsorbent polymer including a cross-linked and/or partially neutralized polyacrylic acid polymer, cross-linked polyacrylic acids or cross-linked starch-acrylic acid graft polymers. The backsheet may be comprised of poly-lactone polymers having generally hydrophobic characteristics. In preferred embodiments, the polymeric materials comprising the topsheet, absorbent core, and backsheet are formed from raw materials with high biobased content.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Patent Publication No. 20170021051 for &#x201c;Biodegradable Absorbent Articles&#x201d; by inventor Richards, et al., filed Jul. 15, 2016, and published Jan. 26, 2017, is directed to a biodegradable, disposable absorbent article, such as a diaper, having a non-woven inner layer of natural fibers and a non-woven outer layer of natural fibers and a treatment applied to at least one surface thereof.

The effectiveness of superabsorbent polymers is typically measured using Free Swell Capacity (FSC), Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC), and/or Absorbance Under Load (AUL). FSC refers to the superabsorbent polymer's ability to swell, whereas CRC refers to the superabsorbent polymer's ability to retain absorbed liquid under force following swelling and AUL refers to the superabsorbent polymer's ability to swell under pressure during swelling; AUL is generally directly related to &#x201c;gel strength&#x201d;. The AUL is critical to success in hygiene product constructions. When absorbent particles have poor gel strength, these particles also have poor permeability and the outer particles will swell too quickly, preventing fluid uptake of the innermost particles. This inhibits the absorbent from swelling to its full potential and is known as gel blocking. Notably, the CRC and the AUL are generally inversely correlated, (i.e., a modified biopolymer with a higher CRC will typically have a lower AUL than a modified biopolymer with a lower CRC).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a preferred embodiment, the modified biopolymer (manufactured from industrial grade corn starch) has a Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC) of at least 15 g/g in a saline solution according to INDA/EDANA Standard NWSP 241.0.R2 (15) entitled &#x201c;Polyacrylate Superabsorbent Powders&#x2014;Determination of the Fluid Retention Capacity in Saline Solution by Gravimetric Measurement Following Centrifugation.&#x201d; In another embodiment, the modified biopolymer has a CRC of at least 16 g/g or at least 19 g/g in a saline solution according to this standard. Alternatively, the modified biopolymer has a FSC of between about 18 and about 32 g/g and a CRC of between about 8 and about 19 g/g in a saline solution. In another embodiment, the modified biopolymer has a FSC of at least 25 g/g and a CRC of at least 17 g/g in a saline solution. In yet another alternative, the modified biopolymer has a FSC between 28 g/g and 45 g/g and a CRC between 17 g/g/ and 30 g/g in a saline solution. In another embodiment, the modified biopolymer has a FSC of between about 18 and about 24 g/g and a CRC of between about 13 and about 16 g/g in defibrinated sheep's blood. In yet another embodiment, the modified biopolymer has a FSC of between about 21 and about 26 g/g and a CRC of between about 15 and about 19 g/g in FDA menses simulant.

In one example, a biopolymer and at least one charge-modifying agent are reacted at a first reaction zone to form a charge-modified biopolymer and the charge-modified biopolymer is crosslinked at a second reaction zone to form a crosslinked, charge-modified biopolymer.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, the extruder is used as one complete reaction vessel, which allows for the reaction to occur along the entire length of the extruder. When two or more reaction zones are provided, the one or more process conditions (e.g., temperature, shear, etc.) in at least one reaction zone are preferably independent of the one or more process conditions in another reaction zone. In one embodiment, a different temperature and/or screw element is provided in at least one reaction zone compared to another reaction zone. In one example, a mixture of a biopolymer (e.g., starch), a plasticizer, a charge-modifying agent, and a catalyst are introduced into a feed zone in an extruder to form a homogeneous reaction blend in the extruder. Varying the temperature in one or more reaction zones in the extruder modifies (e.g., accelerates and/or slows) the reaction taking place in the extruder. In one embodiment, the reaction is accelerated by increasing the temperature in one or more reaction zones in the extruder. Additionally or alternatively, shear is introduced in one more reaction zones (e.g., zone 3 and/or zone 5 of an extruder) by having intense mixing elements in the screw to facilitate mixing and/or shear induced reaction. In yet another embodiment, the length of different reaction zones and/or the length of the extruder itself (e.g., by moving the injection zone closer to the end of the extruder) is varied or adjusted to modify the degree of reaction. The length of the extruder is generally defined as a length over diameter ratio or L/D.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment, the extruder is used as a sequential reactor. In one example, a mixture of a biopolymer (e.g., starch), a plasticizer, and a charge-modifying agent are introduced into a feed zone of an extruder. The mixture is heated as it is transported through one or more reaction zones (e.g., one or more initial reaction zones, such as, e.g., zones 1 and 2) using conveying elements on the screw, and the charge-modifying agent reacts with the biopolymer to form a charge-modified biopolymer. Then, a crosslinking agent is added in either solid or liquid form into one or more reaction zones (e.g., zone 3) to form the crosslinked, charge-modified biopolymer. In another embodiment, following the reaction zone(s) in which the charge-modifying agent was added, an intense mixing screw element is placed on the screw in one or more reaction zones (e.g., in zone 4 and/or 5) to mix the crosslinking agent with the charge-modified biopolymer. In yet another embodiment, the crosslinking reaction is facilitated by different temperatures and/or different screw elements in one or more reaction zones (e.g., zone 4 and/or 5). In still another embodiment, a foaming agent (e.g., water) is injected into the extruder (e.g., in a reaction zone near the end of the extruder, such as, e.g., at zone 6), which causes the crosslinked, charge-modified biopolymer to expand as it exits the die.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one embodiment, one or more reagents (e.g., the biopolymer) is in powder form when added to an extruder and is not in the form of a liquid or a paste. In another embodiment, the one or more reagents in powder form has a moisture content of about 20% by weight or less. In yet another embodiment, the biopolymer and/or the charged-biopolymer are added to the extruder in powder form and/or one or more additional reagents (e.g., a charge-modifier, a plasticizer, a crosslinker, etc.) are added to the extruder in powder form. The one or more additional reagents are added in the same or a different reaction zone than the biopolymer and/or the charge-modified biopolymer.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In one embodiment, components or reactants for one or more steps are dry mixed together prior to addition to the extruder. Alternately or in addition, two or more feeders (e.g., loss-in-weight feeders) are used that supply the components or reactants to be blended to the extruder. In one embodiment, multiple extruders are used to feed melts of the blend components, such as in co-extrusion. The components, reactants, and/or mixture blends are optionally sized by conventional means such as pelletization, granulation, and/or grinding.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">One or more process conditions are modified to provide a particular modified biopolymer (e.g., a superabsorbent, ion exchange resin, etc.) and/or a particular property of a modified biopolymer (e.g., degree of charge modification, crosslinking, etc.). Example processing conditions include, but are not limited to, the type of extruder (e.g., single screw vs. twin screw); screw diameter (D); screw length (L) (L/D is often used to describe an extruder configuration); screw configuration (i.e., specific types of shear inducing sections within an extruder which may range from gentle conveying elements to more shear intensive elements that may be designed to enhance uniform mixing within the extruder and/or accelerate a chemical reaction); temperature (overall and profile along various extruder zones); screw RPM; number of separate extruder zones where both temperature can be changed independent of other zones and different ingredients of the formulation can be added; and feed rate of different formulation elements into different zones. In some embodiments, the combination of one or more independently controlled process variables influence dependent variables of residence time, mechanical energy input (SME) and/or shear. Changes in screw RPM may induce changes in shear, heating and/or residence time in the extruder.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The reacting and/or crosslinking step(s) are preferably carried out and/or performed in a homogeneous reaction blend.

In another embodiment, the layers are constructed from rayon, spandex, Modal, or Micromodal material.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Preferably, the SAP is integrated into absorbent and distributing material, wherein the core is constructed with pores and channels that both trap any received fluid and direct the fluid to SAP particles. In a preferred embodiment, the article includes wood pulp fibers with distributed superabsorbent materials. In one embodiment, the absorbent core includes at least one absorbent foam (e.g., polyurethane foam, high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) foam). Preferably, the absorbent core is biodegradable, compostable, and/or recyclable. In one embodiment, the absorbent core includes absorbent and/or barrier layers between a superabsorbent material. Particle sizes of the superabsorbent materials are important to comfort, wherein a size, distribution, and shape of the particles affect the article perceived softness and the point at which a fluid is felt before an absorbent core is saturated. For example, a size of the particle is preferably hard enough to have sufficient structure without allowing any fluid to be felt by a wearer until the article is between 90% and 100% saturated. In one embodiment, the particle sizes are between approximately 100 and 850 micrometers. In another embodiment, the particle sizes are between approximately 150 and 650 micrometers.

The core was constructed and tested via the following procedures. A core former provided a vacuum of approximately 3 inches H<sub>2</sub>O (approximately 0.108 psi) and created air flow through a rectangular chamber to form cores on a screen that were approximately 10 cm by 40 cm. A bristle brush was used to feed wood pulp fluff and the superabsorbent powder through a screen at an end of the core former to create a fine mix of wood pulp fluff and superabsorbent powder. Approximately six (6) additions of the superabsorbent and fluff mixture were added to the core former. In one embodiment, the ratio of superabsorbent to fluff is approximately 12 g of superabsorbent to 10 g of fluff. In another embodiment, the ratio of superabsorbent to fluff is approximately 55:45. Alternatively, the ratio of superabsorbent polymer to fluff is approximately 60% to approximately 40%. In other embodiments, the ratio of superabsorbent polymer in the absorbent core to fluff is approximately 45% to approximately 70% SAP to approximately 55% to approximately 30% fluff. In another embodiment, the core includes 80% SAP to 20% fluff.

Resulting core material was deposited on a nonwoven film on a top of the screen. The non-woven used in these tests were approximately 25 g/m<sup>2</sup>. After a core was formed, it was mechanically pressed (e.g., via a CLICKER PRESS). The resulting core was approximately 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The cores of the above tests were placed in commercially available chassis, including a backsheet, topsheet, and any intermediate layers (e.g., an ADL), wherein a core of the commercially available chassis was removed.

The absorbent article was then removed and allowed to drain for 5 minutes before being weighed. The absorption capacity was calculated by subtracting a dry weight of the absorbent article from a wet weight of the absorbent article. After a wet weight was measured, the wet absorbent article was placed into a vacuum box and covered with a thin rubber bladder. The article was compressed with a pressure of 14.5 inches of water (0.5233 psi) for 10 minutes, which removed any loose water from the article. The absorbent was article was again weighed to determine the retention weight, and the retention capacity was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of the diaper from the retention weight.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0186">Acquisition time and rewet of the above disclosed product was determined by forming the product into a curved shape by attaching forward and rear tabs of the article together, resulting in a shape that mimicked the product in use.

Alternatively, 100 mL of 0.9 wt % saline is supplied to an inside absorbent region of the diaper via a 4.7 cm inner diameter tube. Acquisition time was determined by an amount of time elapsed between when supply was initiated and when fluid from the tube was completely absorbed. After determining acquisition time, the tube was removed, and the diaper was allowed to rest for 10 minutes. Multiple sheets of dry filter paper were placed on the absorbent region of the product for 2 minutes and a weight rested on the filter paper, resulting in a pressure of approximately 0.7 psi. The sheets of filter paper were removed and weighed, and rewet was calculated by subtracting the dry weight of the sheets of filter paper from the wet weight of the sheets of filter paper. The acquisition time and rewet tests were repeated twice more with a dose of 80 ml of 0.9 wt % saline.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0187">In one embodiment, the absorbent core and/or any other secondary cores or intermediate layers are removable, such that a biodegradable, biocompostable, and/or recyclable core is easily removed from the hygienic article.

These cores mimic compositions run on commercial diaper lines. Cores are formed and tested according to the present invention by pressing a core using a hydraulic press to achieve the desired density and placing the core in a commercially available diaper chassis from which a commercial core has been removed. Specifically, cores are assembled based on a desired composition by inputting layers of fluff and SAP into the forming apparatus. Vacuum suction pulls the contents onto a forming drawer with a nonwoven at the base as support. The core is weighed after the addition of all inputs to assess weight relative to the target weight, and adjustments are made if the weight is different from the target weight. After the target weight is reached, the core is pressed using a hydraulic press to achieve the target density within +/&#x2212;0.01 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Preferably, dimensions for a core are 40 cm&#xd7;10 cm; however, cores are operable to be smaller depending on chassis size.

Following swelling, a 10-minute free hanging period occurs allowing gravity to remove extra fluid that transferred from the reservoir. At the end of the free hanging period, the weight of each sample is recorded, and the free swell is calculated on a gram per gram basis. The samples are then placed in a spin dryer and undergo 3 minutes of centrifuging at approximately 1300 RPMS.

The rig system is completed by placing the cylinders and pistons on glass filter discs in a stainless steel tray containing 0.9 wt. % NaCl and adding a metal weight creating a combined pressure of 0.7 PSI with the piston for a duration of 60 minutes. At the conclusion of testing, the weight of the punchout in combination with the weight of the rig system before and after testing is used to calculate the absorption under load on a gram per gram basis.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0204">Acquisition Time/Rewet Under Load (ATUL/RUL)</p><p id="p-0209" num="0205">This testing assesses the time it takes a baby diaper to uptake subsequent insults and retain the uptake when subjected to a pressure simulating that applied by a child. Prototype diapers are operable to be tested flat or curved, and undergo three doses of 80 mL or 100 mL of dyed 0.9 wt. % NaCl, depending on the specifications for testing.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0206">A stainless-steel dosing column with a steel mesh bottom having approximately 0.0015 inch mesh and three stainless steel dosing rings provide a combined pressure of 0.7 PSI for dosing. The specified insult is dosed through a separatory funnel attached to a ring stand while a stopwatch, accurate to 1/10<sup>th </sup>of a second, and a timer set to 10 minutes 0 seconds, accurate to 1 second per 1 hour, are simultaneously started. As the insult is absorbed by the diaper, the fluid is visibly engulfed below the steel mesh of the dosing column. When this occurs, the stopwatch is stopped, and the time is recorded as the acquisition time under load (ATUL). At the conclusion of the remaining 10 minutes, a stack of qualitative 20-25 &#x3bc;m nominal pore size, 90 mm filter paper is placed on the insult point, dosed, and a 0.7 PSI weight is placed on the filter paper for a duration of two minutes. The first dose includes a 80 mL dose, the second dose, includes an additional 80 mL dose, and the third dose includes an additional 80 mL dose, with each dose being part of a separate test. At the conclusion of the two minutes, the filter paper is weighed and the difference between the original weight of the filter paper and the weight of the filter paper after two minutes of being subjected to the 0.7 PSI weight is referred to as the rewet under load (RUL). This procedure is repeated two additional times for a total of three doses and three rewet measurements.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0207">Absorption Capacity and Retention Capacity</p><p id="p-0212" num="0208">This testing determines the total fluid uptake and retention of a baby diaper under approximately 14 inches of water. Prototypes are submerged in 0.9 wt. % NaCl reservoirs of approximately 3500 mL to approximately 4000 mL for 30 minutes. At the conclusion of submersion, the protypes enter a 5-minute hanging period over metal grates where gravity removes extra fluid that transferred from the reservoir. At this point, the prototypes are weighed to determine their absorption capacity as gram total or on a gram per gram basis. The prototypes are then transferred to a vacuum box and covered with a 1/32&#x2033; latex sheet. A pump is turned on and the latex sheet seals to create a pressure of 14 inches of water. When the desired pressure is achieved, a timer is started for 10 minutes. At the conclusion of the 10 minutes, the prototypes are weighed and their retention capacity is determined on gram per gram basis.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0209">The present invention is explained in greater detail in the following non-limiting Examples.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1.1: Extruded Charge-Modified Biopolymer (Example of Citric Acid Grafted on to Starch at &#x2dc;2 mm Scale)</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0210">A twin screw conical extruder manufactured by DSM, a parallel twin screw extruder manufactured by Leistritz, and a parallel twin screw extruder manufactured by Wegner were used to prepare charge-modified starch.

The results of this measurement technique scale with the FTIR data. As described here in Example 1.1, along with Examples 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, 0.2-0.3 g of sample was exposed to 50 mL of 0.05 M NaOH solution for 1 hr. One drop of phenolphthalein (Item 3241N80, Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, N.J.) was added and mixed into solution to act as a visual indication, approximating neutrality of the solution. A pH probe was used to monitor acid/alkaline nature of the solution during mixing and titration. The solution was then titrated with 0.05M HCl at, &#x2dc;0.05 mL/second. The volume of HCl required to reach pH neutrality was recorded and assumed to be equivalent to the number of moles needed to neutralize excess NaOH in solution. The difference between the recorded moles and initial moles was then normalized to the original sample weight to yield a mol/g or meq/g charge density unit.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0219">DI uptake is a measure of a sample's degree of swelling (i.e., its absorbency by weight under given conditions). DI uptake was measured by inserting &#x2dc;0.25 g sample/cm in 33 mm diameter, of 12-14 kD dialysis tubing (Item 684219, Carolina Biological, Burlington, N.C.). The ends of tubing were sealed and labeled, then exposed to 20 mL DI water per gram of sample for 72 hours. DI water was replaced every 2-3 hours over the course of a 72 hr period. Samples were then removed from the dialysis tubing and weighed. Changes in weight between the initial and final (wet) measurements were normalized to initial mass to grams of DI water absorbed per gram of sample (g/g).</p><p id="p-0233" num="0220">Samples were then dried using a forced air oven and/or a freeze dryer. Weight loss between dried sample and initial sample weight (pre dialysis) was used to calculate extractables as a % of initial sample (inverse of yield). These extractables reflect a measure of the amount of sample that elutes upon initial contact with water. This parameter qualitatively measures the mass fraction of unreacted moieties, plasticizer, and/or degraded polymeric products in a given sample.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Properties of the charged-modified starch</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>FTIR</entry><entry>Titration</entry><entry>DI Uptake</entry><entry>Extractables</entry></row><row><entry>Sample #</entry><entry>(% Trans)</entry><entry>(meq/g)</entry><entry>(g/g)</entry><entry>(%)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1.1A</entry><entry>36</entry><entry>5.9</entry><entry>3.4</entry><entry>89</entry></row><row><entry>1.1B</entry><entry>96</entry><entry>1.9</entry><entry>2.8</entry><entry>87</entry></row><row><entry>1.1C</entry><entry>59</entry><entry>2.8</entry><entry>2.7</entry><entry>37</entry></row><row><entry>1.1D</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>4.2</entry><entry>3.1</entry><entry>30</entry></row><row><entry>1.1E</entry><entry>49</entry><entry>3.8</entry><entry>5.4</entry><entry>49</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0235" num="0221">As can be seen from Tables 3 and 4, charge-modified starch was produced in the process example of reactive extrusion described here. % Transmittance as measured via FTIR is shown to decrease significantly below that of starch (94.5%) while titration values are shown to increase significantly over that of starch (0 meq/g).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0222">Temperature and citric acid (charge modifying agent) concentration are the parameters where increasing inputs show increased charge density.

Grafting citric acid onto starch provides an anionic charge, which changes the degree of charge as can be measured using back titration (meq/g). Acetic acid protonates chitosan upon mixing, thereby providing a cationic charge on the chitosan. The charge-modified chitosan is assumed to be partially (i.e., 50% or more) or fully (100%) protonated due to its solubility in water.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0253">Furthermore, the extruder having multiple zones as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, allows for implementation of temperature and injection profiles. Extrusion and composition parameters for preparing crosslinked, charge-modified starch citrate chitosan were varied as described in Table 33. Here, powder samples of starch, citric acid, and SHP were fed into the initial injection zone (Step 1), while chitosan (Trading Resources, Cocoa Beach, Fla.), acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Item #A6283, St. Louis, Mo.), and plasticizers were simultaneously added in at injection zone 3 (Step 2) as shown in Table 34 below. Reactions zones 1-2 were used for charge modification, while reaction zones 3-8 were used for crosslinking the charge-modified starch to charge-modified chitosan. Temperature profiles for each zone are provided in Table 34 below. Screw profile utilized largely conforms to the medium shear screw as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> (medium shear screw). After the graft reaction of citric acid onto starch, the temperature was decreased to 100&#xb0; C. to allow for the injection of protonated chitosan inside the extruder in zone 3 before raising the temperature to 105&#xb0; C. and 110&#xb0; C. in zones 4 and 5, respectively, to initiate the crosslinking reaction between the starch carboxylate and the free amine groups on the backbone of chitosan. In some runs, extruded samples in solid form were post-treated by placing the charge-modified, crosslinked polymer in an oven at 120&#xb0; C. for 90 minutes.

Samples were tested for their salt uptake capacity measured by conductivity and ash content post exposure to a saline solution.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0263">Ash content testing is a measure of residual inorganic material in a sample upon exposure to high temperatures. 0.3 g of samples was exposed to a 10% saline (NaCl) solution for 5 minutes, then squeezed by hand to remove absorbed liquids. Samples were then transferred to clean, dry, glass vials whose weights were previously recorded. Samples were then exposed to high temperatures in a muffle furnace (Vulcan, Model 3-550), for 4 hours at 575&#xb0; C. following TAPPI Standard: T211 om-02&#x2014;&#x201c;Ash in wood, pulp, paper and paperboard, combustion at 525&#xb0; C.&#x201d; (2002), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. To determine the ash content, the vial weight was subtracted from the final recorded weight of vial and ash. Final ash weight was assumed to be residual captured salts where the final ash weight is divided by the initial sample weight to normalize data to a g NaCl/g sample (g/g) format.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0264">Conductivity is a measure of ionic mobility in a given solution. Reductions in conductivity are attributed to captured ions, changes in system energy (i.e., temperature, pressure, etc.), and/or potential of dissolved ions (i.e., pH changes in presence of acids/bases). Samples (0.3 g) were exposed to 25 mL of 10% NaCl solution where initial conductivity (Metler-Toledo conductivity instrument [model #51302530]) was measured to be 142 mS/cm with a standard deviation of 3.7. Final conductivity measurements were assumed to be attributed to ion capture and was therefore used to calculate a percent difference in conductivity (captured salt). The uptake of salt was correlated to the resulting decrease in conductivity by the following formula:</p><p id="p-0319" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Salt Uptake=(volume in mL*salinity*% &#x394;)/sample weight,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0320" num="0000">where % &#x394; is the % change in conductivity.

AquaFlocc 330AW manufactured by Aquasol Corp (Rock Hill, S.C.) represented the commercially available starch. It is believed that the commercially available cationic starch is modified in a dry process, which maintains starch in granular form and allows only for surface modification of the starch. In contrast, the extrusion process is believed to completely destroy the granular structure of the biopolymer (e.g., starch).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0275">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, which are SEM images of commercially available starch, the commercially available starch retains the starch's characteristic granular structure. In contrast, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>D and <b>7</b>E</figref>, which are SEM images of extruded cationic starch prepared according to methods of the present invention, starches extruded according to embodiments of the present invention exhibit complete destruction of the granular structure and morphology arises only from topology in sample preparation.

These insoluble materials indicate uncharged or lowly charged regions, which are a product of inhomogeneous processing. These results were confirmed via Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS of EDXS), which was used to map the elemental composition of the SEM image for the commercially available starch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>) and the extruded cationic starch prepared according to methods of the present invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, a clear/defined dark region is present where the discrete particles are imaged. This indicates that these particles are different in composition (lacking chlorine) compared to the surrounding region. In contrast, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>, EDS scans of the extruded starch show a gradual change in contrast towards the bottom right of the image. This change correlates to a sloping region on the SEM image towards the bottom right. However, the top left of the image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref> also shows a sloping region in the SEM image, with little change in the EDS map.

The modified biopolymers also have at least 80% biobased carbon content as a percent of total organic carbon according to the ASTM D6866 Carbon 14 Test. The modified biopolymers are biodegradable.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0283">Advantageously, the modified biopolymers are particularly suitable for hygiene applications as they exhibit no cytotoxicity and are not dermal irritants. Cytotoxicity of the modified biopolymers was tested according to ISO 10993-5, using the fully swollen hydrogel form in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) solution in direct contact with cultures of mouse fibroblast L929 cells for 48 hours. The viability of the exposed cells was assessed directly surrounding the test article, with no biological reactivity of the modified biopolymers with exposed cells. The modified biopolymers are considered to have no cytotoxic effect (Grade 0). Cytotoxicity of the modified biopolymers was tested according to ISO 10993-5, 2009, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices&#x2014;Part 5: Tests for In Vitro Cytotoxicity, using extractions obtained of the swollen hydrogel form exposed to cultures of mouse fibroblast L929 cells for 48 hours. The viability of the cells after exposure was assessed using standard MTT assay. The extracts of the modified biopolymers were found to have no biological reactivity with exposed cells, and the modified biopolymers are considered to have no cytotoxic effect (Grade 0). Dermal irritation of the modified biopolymers was tested according to OECD 439, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, &#x201c;In Vitro Skin Irritation: Reconstructed Human Epidermis Test Method&#x201d;, adopted July 2013, using extractions obtained from the swollen hydrogel form exposed to in vitro skin tissue model EpiDerm&#x2122;. The viability of the cells after exposure was assessed using standard MTT assay. The viability of the cells exposed to the modified biopolymers exceeded 100% and the modified biopolymers are considered non-irritating. This testing was conducted by Toxikon Corporation, Bedford Mass., in compliance with current U.S. Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR, Part 58 Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies. As chemicals such as epichlorohydrin are known carcinogens in animals, and are reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens in humans, these chemicals are preferably not used as crosslinkers in hygiene applications due to concerns about cytotoxicity and/or dermal irritation.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0284">Additionally, the primary irritation potential of the modified biopolymers was determined using a 48 hour patch test. The modified biopolymers were added in powder form to saline solution in the ratio of 1.0 g of modified biopolymer per 34 g of saline solution or 3.0 g of modified biopolymer per 100 g of saline solution. The solution was mixed well and allowed to rest for at least 10 minutes, but not more than 24 hours, to form a gel-like test material for testing. Approximately 0.2 g of the test material was applied to a 0.75 inch by 0.75 inch absorbent pad portion of an adhesive dressing, which was secured to an appropriate treatment site to form an occlusive patch. The test material remained in contact with the skin for a total of 2 days, and the site was evaluated for gross changes. Absence of any visible skin change was assigned a zero value. There was no visible skin reaction in any of 100 subjects of both male and female genders whose ages ranged from 18 to 79. There were no adverse events, no amendments, and no deviations.

Looking at the values for the pure (100% interior crosslinked charge modified starch) interior crosslinked charge modified starch, subtracting the absorption result per core weight (g/g) from the free swell capacity, a difference of 3.8 g/g is obtained. Performing the same operation of subtracting the absorption result per core weight (g/g) from the free swell capacity for the pure commercial (0% interior crosslinked charge modified starch) polyacrylate, a difference of 18.5 g/g is obtained. Comparing these two values, there is a notably smaller gap between absorption and free swell capacity for the interior crosslinked charge modified starch than for the commercial polyacrylate. The same type of result is obtained when looking at retention capacity and centrifuge retention capacity, where the pure interior crosslinked charge modified starch has a difference of 2.4 g/g, and the pure commercial polyacrylate has a difference of 7.3 g/g.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0321"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> illustrates a chart showing the Capacity/Core Wt and FSC vs Percent SAP A w/w in Blends with commercial non-biobased SAP.
