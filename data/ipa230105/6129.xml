The skyrmion refers to a spin structure which has a specific directionality formed on the surface of a ferromagnetic layer, for example, a direction in which it converges to the center and a counterclockwise direction in which it rotates. Such a skyrmion has topological properties and shows a new physical phenomenon such as a topological hall effect and a skyrmion hall effect accordingly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Much research is being devoted to the skyrmion. Particularly, after the fact that the skyrmion can exist at room temperature has been found, a lot of research is being conducted for the purpose of device application based on possibilities of electronic device application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because the skyrmion has a very small diameter of a several nanometers and has a relatively small minimum current density for starting operation, the skyrmion can be useful in constructing magnetic memories or logic elements. However, it can be said that the biggest problem in constructing a magnetic memory or a logic element by using the skyrmion is to generate or erase the skyrmion quickly in a controlled state.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Methods for generating the skyrmion by using an existing magnetic field, a current-induced spin torque, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy, or thermal energy have been researched and proposed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method using a magnetic field has many disadvantages in electronic element applications due to the magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method using a current-induced spin torque is able to generate, erase, or move the skyrmion by flowing a current on a plane. However, it is difficult to generate, erase, or move the skyrmion in a single element. Further, since the skyrmion itself is generated by defects of a thin film, the generated skyrmion is hard to move and the generation and erasure of the skyrmion are also greatly affected by the distribution of the defects, so that it may be difficult to use the skyrmion from the viewpoint of applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method using the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy is to generate or erase the skyrmion by applying a voltage vertically. Since the method uses a three-dimensional structure, the method is advantageous in the application of devices which are combined with a two-dimensional structure and have various functionality. However, the method still has a disadvantage that the skyrmion is generated depending on the defect of a thin film so that it cannot freely and rapidly move.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this regard, Korean Patent No. 10-1964904 discloses that when a sine wave current or cosine wave current is applied to a conducting wire, a rotational current is applied to the magnetic layer, thereby generating skyrmion. A paper &#x201c;Creation of magnetic skyrmion bubble lattices by ultrafast laser in ultrathin films&#x201d; discloses that bubble skyrmion is generated by applying vertically a single laser pulse for 35 femtoseconds.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various embodiments relate to an apparatus for generating, erasing, or moving a skyrmion in a magnetic thin film.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide an apparatus for solving the aforementioned problems and for freely generating, erasing, and moving the skyrmion, and a method for the same.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The technical problem to be overcome in this document is not limited to the above-mentioned technical problems.
