The chip is usually an independent entirety that can be used immediately. An electronic chip is a miniature electronic device or component, in which a process is adopted so that wirings and elements such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and inductors required in a circuit are interconnected together, fabricated on one or several small semiconductor wafers or dielectric substrates, and packaged in a shell to form a miniature structure with required circuit functions. All the elements have been structurally integrated as a whole, which makes electronic elements take a big step towards miniaturization, low power consumption, intelligence and high reliability. After an electronic chip is produced, it is necessary for an electronic chip apparatus to conduct comprehensive tests and current and voltage tests on the electronic chip. In the prior art, a detection mode of the electronic chip is that a detection worker holds a detection probe led out from an electrical detection box, and judges whether the electronic chip is qualified by observing states of indicator lights on the electrical detection box and parameters displayed on a display screen. However, this detection mode not only involves intensive labors, but also leads to errors caused by shaking of the detection probe in the detection process, which seriously affects the detection accuracy and has poor practicability. Therefore, it is urgent to design an automatic apparatus for quickly and efficiently detecting chips.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides a chip detection device, a chip detection system and a control method to improve the speed and efficiency of chip detection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technical features of the present disclosure are given as follows.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a chip detection device, including: support plates, a detection platform erected between two of the support plates, a first driving device disposed on the support plate and capable of a linear motion, and a probe holder disposed above the detection platform and connected to the first driving device;

There are two support plates <b>100</b> which are plate-shaped, and the planes on which the two support plates <b>100</b> are located are parallel. The two support plates <b>100</b> may be disposed on a base to ensure the stability. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the two support plates <b>100</b> are integrally formed with the base to form a frame structure with a U-shaped cross-section, which includes a base part and two vertical support parts. Preferably, in order to maintain the stability, a connecting rod is disposed between the two support plates <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A chip to be detected is placed on the detection platform. When the chip is rotated to an uppermost part, a probe descends to be combined with the chip, and then a detection is carried out on the chip. In order to control the longitudinal movement of the probe, the first driving device <b>120</b> is provided on an outer side of the support plate <b>100</b>. The first driving device <b>120</b> has a linear motion function. For example, the first driving device <b>120</b> may be an electrical push rod, an electro-hydraulic push rod, a linear motor, etc., or a gas cylinder or a hydraulic cylinder push rod. In this embodiment, in order to keep the probe holder <b>110</b> being horizontal, lifting distances of the support plates <b>100</b> on both sides are consistent with each other, the first driving device <b>120</b> is disposed at the lower parts the two support plates <b>100</b>, and fixedly connected to the two support plates <b>100</b> to maintain the stability. Specifically, the first driving device <b>120</b> is a linear motion driving device composed of an electrical lead screw and a slider. A slide rail <b>101</b> and a lifting connection plate <b>119</b> are disposed on the outer side of the support plate. A length direction of the slide rail <b>101</b> is vertical, a middle part of the lifting connection plate <b>119</b> is slidably connected to the slide rail <b>101</b>, and an upper part of the lifting connection plate <b>119</b> is fixedly connected to the probe holder <b>110</b>. The probe holder <b>110</b> is erected between the two lifting connection plates <b>119</b>. Lower ends of the two lifting connection plates <b>119</b> are connected to each other by a cross beam <b>140</b>, and a middle part of the cross beam <b>140</b> is fixedly connected to the slider of the first driving device <b>120</b>. After the first driving device <b>120</b> is started, the electrical lead screw rotates to drive the slider to move longitudinally, and then the probe holder <b>110</b> is lifted through the landing connection plate <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The probe holder <b>110</b> is configured to support the probe, which includes a test probe head and a common-end probe head. The detection platform is located below the probe holder <b>110</b>, with their length directions parallel to each other. The detection platform and the probe holder <b>110</b> opposite each other longitudinally. After the probe holder <b>110</b> descends, the probe on the probe holder <b>110</b> contacts the chip on the chip test tray <b>220</b>. In this case, the test probe head is connected to an upper part of the chip, and the common-end probe head is connected to the chip test tray <b>220</b>, which is connected to a lower part of the chip, so that a power-on detection can be realized.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the probe holder <b>110</b> is further provided with a test control circuit. The test control circuit may be disposed outside the main body of the probe holder <b>110</b> and connected by wires. Considering that a long signal transmission distance during the detection will lead to a big error in the detection result, the test control circuit is disposed at an upper part of the probe holder <b>110</b> to realize a nearby detection. The detection result is stored or transmitted to other devices through a communication line.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, considering that sparks will be generated when the probe contacts the chip instantaneously during the chip detection, which will affect the quality of the chip, inert gas protection is adopted to prevent the sparks. Therefore, the probe on the probe holder <b>110</b> is disposed in a cavity <b>115</b> which is communicated with a positive-pressure inert gas source. The cavity <b>115</b> is opened (i.e., has an opening) on a side where the probe head is located. Since the cavity <b>115</b> is connected to the positive-pressure inert gas source, oxygen in the cavity <b>115</b> is driven away by the inert gas, and the concentration of the oxygen in the cavity <b>115</b> is reduced, which prevents the sparks from being generated when the probe contacts the chip, so as to ensure the quality of the chip.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the cavity <b>115</b> is surrounded by the probe holder <b>110</b> and an enclosure <b>113</b> disposed on a periphery thereof. In order to conduct the inert gas, the enclosure <b>113</b> or the probe holder <b>110</b> is provided with a main protective gas hole <b>111</b> and a gas dispersion hole <b>112</b>, and a length direction of the main protective gas hole <b>111</b> is parallel to a length direction in which the probes are arranged. The gas dispersion hole <b>112</b> communicates the main protective gas hole <b>111</b> and the cavity <b>115</b>, and the main protective gas hole <b>111</b> is communicated with the positive-pressure inert gas source. The enclosure <b>113</b> is strip-shaped and perpendicular to the probe holder. The enclosure <b>113</b> is connected to the probe holder by screwing or clamping. The enclosure <b>113</b> is disposed around the probe and closed in a peripheral direction, and an inner side of the enclosure <b>113</b> forms the cavity <b>115</b> with the lower part opened. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in this embodiment, the main protective gas hole <b>111</b> is disposed at the upper part of the probe holder <b>110</b>, and the enclosure <b>113</b> is provided with a gas inlet interface communicated with the main protective gas hole <b>111</b>. In order to disperse the inert gas while ensuring the content thereof at a part where the probe contacts the chip, a lower part of the gas dispersion hole <b>112</b> is inclined toward an end of the probe. The main protective gas hole <b>111</b> is communicated with the external positive-pressure inert gas through the gas inlet interface disposed on the probe holder <b>110</b> or the enclosure <b>113</b>.
