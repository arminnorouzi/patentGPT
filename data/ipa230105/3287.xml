More specifically, the disclosure relates to a gear mechanism for increasing the torque in a shaft, as defined in the introductory parts of claim <b>1</b>.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The torque of a rotating shaft, such as the output shaft of a motor, may be amplified by a gear mechanism. This is useful if the torque of the motor is not sufficient for a specific purpose, or the motor is not able to provide a sufficient torque. An input shaft of such a gear mechanism may be connected to the output shaft of the motor, and, by various gear transmissions and mechanical couplings, an output shaft of the gear mechanism may be provided with an increased torque. Commonly, the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the output shaft from a mechanical gear mechanism is lower compared to the RPM of the output shaft of the motor, while the torque has increased.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alternatively, several commonly known torque amplifiers require an added source of energy. As such, the RPM can be constant from the output shaft of the motor to the output shaft of the torque amplifier, while torque is added to the output shaft of the torque amplifier. However, it is often not practical nor an alternative to provide such an external source of energy, such that a gear mechanism as described in the previous section is preferred.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electric motors are more and more commonly used for a range of applications, and such motors are often compact and lightweight. However, electric motors do not necessarily provide sufficient direct torque, and there is therefore a need for efficient gear mechanisms to provide increased torque. Commonly known gear mechanisms for increasing torque could be as effective as 90-95%, but there is still a loss of energy while the torque is increased, and more efficient gear mechanism are needed in order to more effectively utilize the energy in e.g. electric applications. As such, even a small amount of increase in efficiency of such a gear mechanism could provide a great increase in efficiency of a motor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known gear mechanisms are heavy and may comprise several parts, and may be a complex mechanical assembly that is both expensive to manufacture and to maintain. Known gear mechanisms are also in many cases not very reliable, and may require regular maintenance. Known gear mechanisms may neither be suited to a wide range of input RPM.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is therefore a need for an improved gear mechanism to reduce or eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages of known techniques. It is an objective of the present invention to achieve this and to provide further advantages over the state of the art.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies and disadvantages in the prior art and solve at least the above mentioned problem.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, there is provided a gear mechanism for increasing torque, comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">an input shaft;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">at least one intermediate shaft;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">where the at least one intermediate shaft is parallel and offset from the input shaft; at least one force transmitting member connecting the input shaft and the at least one intermediate shaft;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">where the at least one force transmitting member is configured for rotating the at least one intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the at least one intermediate shaft is mating with at least one fixed mating member and is rotatably connected to a rotatable support member;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the support member is rotatable about the input shaft and connected to an output shaft.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The input shaft of the gear mechanism according to the invention can be a solid shaft, but can also be a pipe. The input shaft can be of metal, but can also be of other materials, like plastic materials, composite materials or even wood.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The input shaft can have a continuous outer shape, for example the outer shape of a round cylinder. Other outer shapes of the input shaft are feasible too, like for example polygonal outer shapes. Instead of a continuous outer shape, the input shaft also can have interruptions of a continuous outer shape, for example can have steps inbetween sections, whereby in a preferred embodiment the individual section of the input shaft that borders the step has a continuous shape. Steps can be used to position bearings for example.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The intermediate shaft of the gear mechanism according to the invention can be a solid shaft, but can also be a pipe. The intermediate shaft can be of metal, but can also be of other materials, like plastic materials, composite materials or even wood.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The intermediate shaft can have a continuous outer shape, for example the outer shape of a round cylinder. Other outer shapes of the intermediate shaft are feasible too, like for example polygonal outer shapes. Instead of a continuous outer shape, the intermediate shaft also can have interruptions of a continuous outer shape, for example can have steps inbetween sections, whereby in a preferred embodiment the individual section of the intermediate shaft that borders the step has a continuous shape. Steps can be used to position bearings for example.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the invention, at least one intermediate shaft is provided that is parallel and offset from the input shaft. In a preferred embodiment, at least two, preferably at least three, preferably at least four, preferably at least five intermediate shafts are provided. It is believed that in increasing the number of shafts the force is better distributed and the balance is better. Increasing the number of shafts might even reduce the friction inside the mear mechanism. In a preferred embodiment, several, preferably the majority, more preferably all intermediate shafts provided are of the same shape and/or size.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, at least one force transmitting member connecting the input shaft and the at least one intermediate shaft is provided. In a preferred embodiment, for each intermediate shaft provided an individual force transmitting member is provided. Designs might be feasible, where one force transmitting member connects several, preferably the majority, preferably all intermediate shafts with the input shaft, for example a chain or a belt. While it is considered feasible within a preferred embodiment to have one force transmitting member connect several, preferably the majority, preferably all intermediate shafts with the input shaft, by way of this force transmitting member being a chain or a belt, in an even more preferred embodiment a chain or a belt is used to implement the preferred embodiment, wherein for each intermediate shaft provided an individual force transmitting member is provided. Hence in a preferred embodiment one belt or one chain is provided per intermediate shaft. Independent of the type of force transmitting member used in a preferred embodiment, for each intermediate shaft provided an individual force transmitting member is provided.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment, the force transmitting member is a chain or a belt. The belt can be a friction belt or can be a toothed belt. The chain can be a metallic chain or can be a chain from a different material. In a preferred embodiment, the chain is a roller chain, preferably a chain of the type 04B1. In a preferred embodiment, the chain pitch is between 1 mm and 50 mm, preferably between 1 mm and 40 mm, preferably between 1 mm and 30 mm, preferably between 1 mm and 20 mm, preferably between 1 mm and 10 mm, preferably the chain pitch is 6 mm.

A flexible drive shaft is understood to be a device for transmitting rotary motion between two objects which are not fixed relative to one another. It consists of a rotating wire rope or coil which is flexible but has some torsional stiffness. The flexible drive shaft may be connected with one end to the end of the input shaft and with the other end with an end of the intermediate shaft thereby rotating the intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment the force transmitting member comprises an universal joint (often also referred to as universal coupling, U-joint, Cardan joint, Spicer or Hardy Spicer joint, or Hooke's joint). An universal joint is considered to be a joint or coupling connecting rigid rods whose axes are inclined to each other, and is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion. It consists of a pair of hinges located close together, oriented at 90&#xb0; to each other, connected by a cross shaft. In a preferred embodiment, the force transmitting member comprises two universal joints with a rod arranged inbetween the two universal joints. In such an embodiment, the first universal joint could be connected with the input shaft on one side and the rod on the other side, while the rod is connected to the second universal joint on its other side, the second universal joint being connected to the intermediate shaft on its respective other side.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thereby the force transmitting member can rotate the intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a preferred embodiment two intermediated shafts are provided, namely a first intermediate shaft and a second intermediate shaft, whereby<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0026">a force transmitting is connected to the input shaft and the first intermediate shaft, wherein the force transmitting member is configured for rotating the first intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0027">an auxiliary force transmitting member is connected to the first intermediate shaft and the second intermediate shaft, wherein the auxiliary force transmitting member is configured for rotating the second intermediate shaft in the same direction as the first intermediate shaft.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">Hence while in a preferred embodiment the number of force transmitting members provided equals the number of intermediate shafts, designs are also feasible, where several intermediate shafts are present, but only one or some of these intermediate shafts is connected to a force transmitting member and other intermediate shafts are rotated by way of one or more auxiliary force transmitting members arranged between such an intermediate shaft and an intermediate shaft that is driven by an auxiliary force transmitting member.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">The auxiliary force transmitting member preferably is a chain or a belt.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">According to the invention the at least one force transmitting member is configured for rotating the at least one intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft. This is for example achieved by a belt or a chain that is set around the input shaft and driven by the input shaft and runs onto the intermediate shaft in a straight line from the input shaft and runs around the intermediate shaft to then rotate the intermediate shaft in the same direction as the input shaft.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">According to the invention, the at least one intermediate shaft is mating with at least one fixed mating member. In a preferred embodiment, the fixed mating member is provided by way of it being connected to or arranged on or being part of a housing of the gear mechanism that remains stationary in comparison to a movement of the intermediates shaft and/or the input shaft. In a preferred embodiment the mating between the intermediate shaft and the fixed mating member is provided by a gear wheel provided on the intermediate shaft that meshes with a fixed gear wheel that provides the fixed mating member. In a preferred embodiment, the gear wheel provided on the intermediate shaft and the fixed gear wheel, it mashes with, (the fixed mating member) are externally threaded gear wheels. The gear wheel provided on the intermediate shaft hence runs around the outside of the fixed gear wheel (the fixed mating member). However, designs are also feasible, where the fixed gear wheel (the fixed mating member) is an internally threaded gear wheel as they are known from planetary gear mechanisms. In such a design, the gear wheel provided on the intermediate shaft hence runs around the inward facing thread of the fixed gear wheel (the fixed mating member). The mating of the intermediate shaft with the at least one fixed mating member can also be provided by other means. The intermediate shaft can have a wheel that roles along a curved, preferably circular outer or inner surface of the fixed mating member.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">The fixed mating member preferably is fixedly attached to a housing of the gear mechanism. The fixed mating member can be an element of the housing that is made as one piece with the housing, for example a shoulder of the housing. The fixed mating member can be fixedly, but releasably attached to the housing, for example by way of bolts and nuts or by way of screws and threads or by way of pins or by way of rivets. The fixed mating member can also be fixed to the housing by way of welding, gluing, interference fit with a step of the housing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">According to the invention, the intermediate shaft is rotatably connected to a rotatable support member. The rotatable connection between the intermediate shaft and the rotatable support member can for example be by way of ball bearings, preferably by two-row ball bearings or by needle bearings or by way of a bush or by way of an electromagnetic field or by way of a magnetic field or by way of high pressure oil sleeves.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment the support member is made of aluminum, cast iron or composite materials.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">In a preferred embodiment, the support member is a block.

The block preferably is a rectangular block if two intermediate shafts are provided. In such a design, preferably each of the two intermediate shafts would be rotatably connected to the block at one of the ends such that at each end of the block one intermediate shaft would be connected to the block.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">The block may be of star shape, for example of the shape of a three-legged star, in an embodiment that has three intermediates shafts, whereby each intermediate shaft would be rotatably connected to the end of one of the legs respectively.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, if the length of the support member is understood to be the extend that the support member has in the direction radial to the intermediate shaft and if the width of the support member is understood to be a direction perpendicular to the length, but also radial to the input shaft and the height of the support member is understood to be the direction perpendicular to the length and perpendicular to the width, but co-axial or parallel to the axial extend of the input shaft, in such a set of coordinate it is preferred if the width and/or the height of the support member stay the same for the majority of the extend in the direction of the length of the support member.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">Preferably the width and/or the height of the support member only changes at the end of the support member. This design rule can be applied to a support member that has the shape of a block or can be applied to a support member that is star shaped, whereby the design rule would be applied for each leg of the star.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, the support member is arranged on one side of the force transmitting member.

In a preferred embodiment the support member is arranged on one side of all force transmitting members present and does not encapsulate any force transmitting member present.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">The output shaft of the gear mechanism according to the invention can be a solid shaft, but can also be a pipe. The output shaft can be of metal, but can also be of other materials, like plastic materials, composite materials or even wood.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">The output shaft can have a continuous outer shape, for example the outer shape of a round cylinder. Other outer shapes of the output shaft are feasible too, like for example polygonal outer shapes. Instead of a continuous outer shape, the output shaft also can have interruptions of a continuous outer shape, for example can have steps inbetween sections, whereby in a preferred embodiment the individual section of the output shaft that borders the step has a continuous shape.

preferred example embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in other forms and should not be construed as limited to the herein disclosed embodiments. The disclosed embodiments are provided to fully convey the scope of the invention to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0104">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a cross-section through a first embodiment of a gear mechanism <b>1</b> is shown. The gear mechanism <b>1</b> comprises an input shaft <b>2</b>. The input shaft <b>2</b> may be connected to a rotating shaft from e.g. a motor. The gear mechanism <b>1</b> may be housed in a housing <b>3</b>, and the input shaft <b>2</b> may extend into the housing <b>3</b>. To rotatably support the input shaft <b>2</b> in the housing <b>3</b>, the housing <b>3</b> may be provided with an input shaft bearing <b>4</b>. The input shaft bearing <b>4</b> may be one or more ball bearings, lubricated sealing rings or similar means known in the art of supporting a rotating shaft.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0105">The gear mechanism <b>1</b> further comprises an intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. The illustrated embodiment comprises two intermediate shafts <b>5</b>, but the gear mechanism <b>1</b> may as such comprise any number of intermediate shafts <b>5</b>. In order to balance the gear mechanism, two or more intermediate shafts could be distributed evenly around the input shaft <b>2</b>. E.g. two intermediate shafts <b>5</b> could be spaced apart 180&#xb0; about the input shaft <b>2</b> (as in the illustrated embodiment), three intermediate shafts could be spaced apart 120&#xb0; about the input shaft, etc. In order to keep the number of components (and weight) to a minimum, two intermediate shafts <b>5</b> may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0106">The two intermediate shafts <b>5</b> of the illustrated embodiment are positioned on opposite sides of the input shaft <b>2</b>. This provides a gear mechanism <b>1</b> that is balanced and e.g. vibration may be minimized. An intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is parallel and offset from the input shaft <b>2</b>, i.e. the rotation axis of an intermediate shaft <b>5</b> has the same direction as the rotation axis of the input shaft <b>2</b>, but the two axes are not coincident.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">A force transmitting member <b>6</b> connects the input shaft <b>2</b> and the at least one intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. The force transmitting member <b>6</b> may be any member capable of rotating the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> in the same direction as the input shaft <b>2</b>. If the rotation of the input shaft <b>2</b> is clockwise, the rotation of the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is also clockwise. The force transmitting member <b>6</b> is in the illustrated embodiment a chain, but may also be a belt, a wire or any member configured for transmitting a rotational motion from one shaft to another. The force transmitting member <b>6</b> could as such be an internal gear mating with the input shaft <b>2</b> and intermediate shaft <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0108">The weight of the force transmitting member <b>6</b> plays a role in the effect of the gear mechanism, and e.g. a chain may be both heavier and have less power loss when transmitting a force compared to e.g. a belt, such that a chain comprising metal links may be preferred. The force transmitting member <b>6</b> is also preferably exterior to the input shaft <b>2</b> and the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. When the force transmitting member <b>6</b> is spun by the input shaft <b>2</b>, a centrifugal force is created. This centrifugal force increases the efficiency of the gear mechanism.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0109">The illustrated embodiment comprises two intermediate shafts <b>5</b>, and as such, two force transmitting members <b>6</b> connect the input shaft <b>2</b> to the two intermediate shafts <b>5</b>. The force transmitting members <b>6</b> are independent of each other, and may be positioned spaced apart on the input shaft <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">In order to transmit the rotational force from the input shaft <b>2</b> to the force transmitting member <b>6</b>, the input shaft <b>2</b> may be provided with an input shaft output member <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0111">The input shaft output member <b>7</b> is configured for rotating with the input shaft <b>2</b>, and connection with the force transmitting member <b>6</b>. The input shaft output member <b>7</b> may simply be a portion of the input shaft <b>2</b>, or it may be a separate member. The input shaft output member <b>7</b> may have a radius greater than the input shaft <b>2</b>. The input shaft output member <b>7</b> may be fixed to the input shaft <b>2</b>, and is in the illustrated embodiment an external gear configured to mate with the force transmitting member <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0112">An intermediate shaft <b>5</b> may correspondingly be provided with an intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> to mate with the force transmitting member <b>6</b>. The intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> is configured for rotating with the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>, and connection with the force transmitting member <b>6</b>. The intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> may simply be a portion of the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>, or it may be a separate member. The intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> may have a radius greater than the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. The intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> may be fixed to the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>, and is in the illustrated embodiment an external gear configured to mate with the force transmitting member <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0113">The intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is mating with fixed mating members <b>9</b>.

In the first illustrated embodiment, the two intermediate shafts <b>5</b> both mate with two mating members <b>9</b>. The intermediate shafts <b>5</b> of the first embodiment mate with the mating members <b>9</b> at distal ends of the intermediate shafts <b>5</b>. The gear mechanism <b>1</b> may comprise at least one fixed mating member <b>9</b>, and one or more of the at least one fixed mating member <b>9</b> may be fixed to the housing <b>3</b>. The fixed mating members <b>9</b> do not rotate or move relative to the input shaft <b>2</b> and the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>, and in the illustrated embodiment, the fixed mating members <b>9</b> are positioned on the inside of the housing <b>3</b>. The input shaft <b>2</b> may extend through one fixed mating member <b>9</b>, and more specifically, the input shaft <b>2</b> may extend through the centre of a fixed mating member <b>9</b>. The fixed mating members <b>9</b> are in the illustrated embodiment external gears. As the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is rotated by the force transmitting member <b>6</b> and mates with the fixed mating members <b>9</b>, the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is consequently driven around the fixed mating members <b>9</b>. The input shaft <b>2</b> is positioned in the centre of one of the fixed mating members <b>9</b>, and as the input shaft <b>2</b> is rotated, the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is rotated both around itself and consequently also around the input shaft <b>2</b>.

The intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> may also simply be a portion of the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. If the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is configured for mating with two fixed mating members <b>9</b>, the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> may comprise two intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> as in the illustrated embodiment. The two intermediate shaft output members <b>10</b> are in the illustrated embodiment positioned at distal ends of the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0115">The intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is further rotatably connected to a rotatable support member <b>11</b>. The support member <b>11</b> is configured to rotate about the input shaft <b>2</b>, i.e. the support member <b>11</b> has a rotation axis that is coincident with the rotation axis of the input shaft <b>2</b>. The intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is rotatably connected to the support member <b>11</b> off-center, such that when the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is rotated about the fixed mating members <b>9</b> and input shaft <b>2</b>, the support member <b>11</b> is also rotated about the input shaft <b>2</b>. The support member <b>11</b> may be shaped similarly to a disc or an arm, where the at least one intermediate shaft <b>5</b> may be connected to the support member <b>11</b> at an outer periphery.

The input shaft <b>2</b> may as such be supported at two independent locations; at the input shaft bearing <b>4</b> on the housing <b>3</b>, and at the central bearing <b>13</b> of the support member <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0118">The support member <b>11</b> is connected to an output shaft <b>14</b>. The connection between the support member <b>11</b> and the output shaft <b>14</b> may be direct as in the illustrated embodiment, or may be by gears and similar means. The support member <b>11</b> may be fixed to the output shaft <b>14</b>, as in the illustrated embodiment. If there is a direct connection between the support member <b>11</b> and the output shaft <b>14</b>, the output shaft <b>14</b> is positioned in the center of the support member <b>11</b>. As such, the rotation axis of the output shaft <b>14</b> coincides with the rotation axis of the input shaft <b>2</b>. The output shaft <b>14</b> may be rotatably supported by an output shaft bearing <b>15</b>.

Each force transmitting member <b>6</b> is exterior to the input shaft <b>2</b> and the respective intermediate shaft <b>5</b>. As the input shaft <b>2</b> of the gear mechanism <b>1</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction D<b>1</b>, the intermediate shafts <b>5</b> are correspondingly rotated in the clockwise direction D<b>2</b>. This may be caused by the force transmitting members <b>6</b> mating with the input shaft output member <b>7</b><i>s </i>and the intermediate shaft input members <b>8</b>. As previously mentioned, the illustrated embodiment comprises two input shaft output members <b>7</b>, two force transmitting member <b>6</b>, two intermediate shafts <b>5</b> and two intermediate shaft input members <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0120">Because an intermediate shaft <b>5</b> mates with a fixed mating member <b>9</b> by e.g. an intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b>, the intermediate shaft <b>5</b> is rotated about the input shaft <b>2</b> in the clockwise direction D<b>3</b>. The support member <b>11</b>, being rotatably connected to the intermediate shaft <b>5</b>, is thus also rotated in the clockwise direction D<b>3</b>. The output shaft <b>14</b> is connected to the support member <b>11</b> and is rotated in a corresponding clockwise direction D<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0121">The increased torque of the output shaft <b>14</b> compared to that of the input shaft <b>2</b> is due to a number of factors. The relationship between the radius of the input shaft output member <b>7</b> and the radius of the intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> may be adjusted. In the first embodiment, the input shaft output member <b>7</b> and the intermediate shaft input member <b>8</b> have corresponding radiuses. A larger radius of the input shaft output member <b>7</b> would increase the RPM of the output shaft <b>14</b>, but decrease the torque. Correspondingly, a smaller radius of the input shaft output member <b>7</b> would decrease the RPM of the output shaft <b>14</b> and increase the torque.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0122">The relationship between the radius of the intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> and the radius of the fixed mating member <b>9</b> may also be adjusted. In the first embodiment, the intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> and the fixed mating member <b>9</b> have corresponding radiuses. A larger radius of the intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> would increase the RPM of the output shaft <b>14</b>, but decrease the torque. Correspondingly, a smaller radius of the intermediate shaft output member <b>10</b> would decrease the RPM of the output shaft <b>14</b> and increase the torque.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0123">Moreover, the mass of the force transmitting members <b>6</b> affect the output power of the output shaft <b>14</b>. The energy loss through the gear mechanism <b>1</b> is lower with force transmitting members <b>6</b> with higher mass than force transmitting members <b>6</b> with lower mass. This could be due to the centrifugal forces at play as the force transmitting members <b>6</b> are rotated around the input shaft <b>2</b> and the intermediate shafts <b>5</b>, while the intermediate shafts <b>5</b> are rotated around the input shaft <b>2</b>. The gear mechanism <b>1</b> has as such proven to be highly effective. The force transmitting members <b>6</b> could be provided with more mass to increase the efficiency of the gear mechanism <b>1</b>. A chain could e.g. be equipped with thicker and heavier links, a belt could be provided with weights, and the force transmitting members <b>6</b> could in general be made from materials with a high mass density.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0124">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a second embodiment of a gear mechanism <b>1</b>&#x2032; is shown. This embodiment comprises fewer parts than the first illustrated embodiment, and may as such be lighter and less expensive to manufacture and maintain. The gear mechanism <b>1</b>&#x2032; of the second embodiment may be suited for connection to motors with a lower output power than the gear mechanism of the first embodiment, because the intermediate shafts <b>5</b>&#x2032; are mating with only one fixed mating member <b>9</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0125">To avoid describing similar features and principles twice, the features and principles of the first embodiment applies to the second embodiment unless otherwise noted.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0126">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a part of the housing <b>3</b>&#x2032; is shown, the rest of the housing <b>3</b>&#x2032; has been removed for illustrating purposes.
