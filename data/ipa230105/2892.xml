In particular, the disclosure relates to ampoules and methods to provide bottom fed sublimation bed and tortuous flow path for low vapor pressure precursors.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor industry is using an increasing variety of chemistries for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes that come in liquid or solid form. The precursor is typically inside a closed vessel or ampoule with a single inlet and a single outlet.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solid precursors with a low vapor pressure frequently use a carrier gas to carry the vapor out of the ampoule to the process reactor. For these types of processes there are two types of ampoules typically used: a bubbler where the inlet carrier gas goes into a tube that is submerged into the precursor; and a cross-flow ampoule where the carrier gas sweeps headspace in the ampoule from the top. Often, there is only a very short flow path for the carrier gas. The short flow path from the inlet to the outlet of the vessel does not allow adequate residence time within the vessel to allow the carrier gas to become fully saturated with vaporized or sublimed precursor. Some existing ampoule designs do not evenly distribute the carrier gas across the entire surface of the precursor. Some existing ampoules designs do not provide adequate heating of the precursor within the entire vessel. Many other solid source ampoules do not provide a means for keeping precursor dust from traveling downstream where it hampers control valve performance or creates on-wafer particle issues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional top-fed sublimation architectures include an ampoule or cannister partially filled with solid precursor, which rests on the bottom of the ampoule. As the ampoule is heated and carrier gas is introduced into the head space of the ampoule, sublimation occurs between the top surface of the solid precursor and the carrier gas within the head space. In an ideal scenario, the carrier gas flowing through the ampoule becomes saturated with the precursor. As the head space of the ampoule increases, resulting in varying concentrations of saturated carrier gas, an inconsistent dose of precursor-carrier gas is supplied. As such, carrier gas saturation is not maintained due to inefficiencies in the ampoule and solid precursor depletion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need in the art for ampoules, methods of making ampoules and/or methods of using ampoules with one or more of an increased flow path, increased surface area for sublimation and for consistent concentrations of saturated carrier gas.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more embodiments are directed to an ampoule for a semiconductor precursor material having a torturous path for increased dwell time in a bottom-fed configuration.

The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some embodiments of the disclosure advantageously provide a long flow path for a carrier gas from ampoule inlet to outlet for the delivery of low vapor pressure precursors, e.g., liquid and/or solid source precursor. Low vapor pressure precursors are understood to refer to materials that do not readily vaporize under atmospheric conditions. Low vapor pressure precursors typically have a vapor pressure of less than 10 Torr, and more typically less than 1 Torr. In some applications, a carrier gas is used to deliver low vapor pressure material from an ampoule to a reactor. Low vapor pressure materials typically require heat to increase the vapor pressure. A non-limiting list of exemplary precursors includes ZrCl<sub>4</sub>, Y(EtCP)<sub>3</sub>, HfCl<sub>4</sub>, WCl<sub>5</sub>, MoCl<sub>5</sub>, In(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and liquid SiI<sub>4</sub>, Mg(Cp)<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A flow path having a long and torturous distance allows the carrier gas adequate residence time to become partially to nearly to fully saturated with vaporized and/or sublimed and/or entrained precursor. As used herein, the term &#x201c;torturous path&#x201d; means a flow path that has multiple branches, curves, angles, turns, etc., that prevent a straight path for the flow. In some embodiments, the torturous path increases the residence time of the gas within the manifold to increase concentration uniformity. Reference herein to &#x201c;saturated&#x201d; allows for varying degrees of saturation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some embodiments of the disclosure advantageously provide bottom-fed ampoule configurations. Some embodiments advantageously provide ampoules in which depletion of the solid precursor does not affect the concentration of the saturated carrier gas.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some embodiments provide apparatus and methods for heating low vapor pressure precursors in large volume ampoules, including ways to provide effective uniform heating of the precursors. Some specific embodiments advantageously retain low vapor pressure precursors, including solid precursor dust, within a cavity of the vessel, not allowing it to migrate upstream or downstream to control valves by means of filter media. Some embodiments advantageously control uneven depletion of the precursor. Some embodiments advantageously provide even distribution of the carrier gas along the entire surface of a precursor bed in a bottom-fed configuration. Embodiments herein provide improved doses of the precursor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the ampoules comprise a bottom wall having a plurality of elongate walls defining a labyrinth such that the flow path is tortuous. Advantageously, one or more embodiments provide a flow path whose distance can be five to ten times longer than distances found with common ampoules, in particular solid source sublimation vessels. The increased flow path allows for a longer dwell time of carrier gas and vaporized precursor chemistry to mix within the ampoule.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Ampoules disclosed herein comprise a container defining a cavity configured to hold a precursor; an inlet port and an outlet port, both in fluid communication with the cavity; and a bottom wall having a serpentine base. The serpentine base comprises a plurality of elongate walls arranged to define torturous flow channels (also referred to a &#x201c;serpentine path&#x201d;), each of the elongate walls comprising a plurality of openings. A flow path is defined by the flow channels and the plurality of openings, through which a carrier gas flows in contact with vaporized or sublimed precursor.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Ampoules disclosed herein are in a bottom-fed configuration such that the precursor is separated from a lower chamber by a sublimation bed defined by a filter media. In such a configuration, the gas exchange zone below the filter media maintains a constant volume as precursor resting above the filter media is depleted as carrier gas passes across the filter media. The gas exchange zone is configured to increase the dwell time of carrier gas and vaporized precursor chemistry to mix within the ampoule.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Carrier gas passes across the sublimation bed in the gas exchange zone where the precursor chemistry and the carrier gas mix and flow to form a saturated gas mixture of precursor and carrier gas. Carrier gas is streamed directly across the filter media in order to saturate the carrier gas with precursor particles. In some embodiments, the carrier gas flows through a torturous path positioned within the gas exchange zone. The torturous path and the gas exchange zone is configured to increase the duration in which the carrier gas is interacting with precursor chemistry to promote increased saturation of the carrier gas with vaporized precursor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, the flow paths provided herein force the carrier gas to flow around a series of elongate walls, which in one or more particular embodiments are nested concentric tubes having one or more plurality of openings passageways, which define flow channels. The gas flow changes direction from flow channel to flow channel until the last flow channel in communication with the outlet port is reached. This change of direction also enhances mixing of the vaporized and/or sublimed precursor with the carrier gas. Plurality of openings are offset from one another allow the carrier gas to flow through into the next flow channel creating a torturous path. As the carrier gas passes from an inlet opening of an outermost elongate wall through the gas exchange zone, through an outlet opening of an innermost elongate wall, pure carrier gas becomes partially saturated and then fully saturated with precursor chemistry before exiting through the outlet of the ampoule.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference herein to gas flow includes the carrier gas alone or in combination with entrained and/or vaporized and/or sublimed precursor. The flow paths of the gas exchange zones described herein, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> comprise a series of elongate walls, tubular or otherwise, with plurality of openings offset from one another configured to define flow channels therebetween will result in a desired flow path.
