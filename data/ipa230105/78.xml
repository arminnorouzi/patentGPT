Mesotrione controls a wide range of broad-leaved weeds that compete with maize and specialty crops. Mesotrione can also suppress certain annual grass weeds that may be present in the crop. Mesotrione's selectivity is understood to be based on its greater potency on a target enzyme in dicotyledons relative to monocotyledons. Moreover, maize can metabolize the dione-containing ring. Mesotrione often is formulated as a suspension concentrate, and has a water solubility of 1,500 mg/L at 20&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Oxyfluorfen, 2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl 3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenyl ether, is a selective pre- and post-emergent herbicide that is often used to control certain annual broadleaf and grassy weeds in vegetables, tree fruit, cotton, ornamentals, and on non-crop areas (e.g. rail and highway right-of-ways).

Mesotrione controls a wide range of broad-leaved weeds, again particularly those that compete with maize, and can also suppress certain annual grass weeds that may be present in a crop. Mesotrione's selectivity is understood to be based on its greater potency on a target enzyme in dicotyledons relative to monocotyledons.

Method of Use</heading><p id="p-0146" num="0119">Disclosed embodiments concern using a combination or composition for controlling undesirable vegetation in crops. Disclosed method embodiments may comprise applying an herbicidal combination or composition according to the present invention to a locus of planted crops where undesirable vegetation occurs or might occur or to a locus where crops will be planted before planting or emergence of the crop. Application can be done before, during and/or after, preferably during and/or after, the emergence of the undesirable vegetation. Herbicides of the present disclosure, such as mesotrione and, oxyfluorfen, and any optional third or more co-herbicide, can be applied simultaneously, including as a premix, a diluted premix, or a tank mix, or in succession. The invention in particular relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation in crops comprising applying a disclosed composition comprising, or consisting of or consisting essentially of, herbicides of the present disclosure, such as mesotrione and oxyfluorfen, to a locus of planted crops where undesirable vegetation occurs or might occur or to a locus where crops will be planted before planting or emergence of the crop. The combination or composition also can be applied to a locus of planted crops which, by genetic engineering or by breeding, are resistant to one or more herbicides and/or pathogens such as plant-pathogenous fungi, and/or to attack by insects. Although certain exemplary embodiments are formulated as a premix comprising mesotrione and oxyfluorofen, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that mesotrione, oxyfluorofen, and the one or more optional co-herbicides, may be formulated jointly or separately and applied jointly or separately. Moreover, in the case of separate application, the order of application also may vary. However, when used as a combination, mesotrione herbicide and oxyfluorofen should be applied in a time frame that allows simultaneous action of the active ingredients on the undesirable plants.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0120">Disclosed herbicidal combinations, such as compositions, according to the present application can be applied in any manner suitable as will be known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, disclosed herbicidal compositions can be surface applied prior to planting, such as 45 days prior to planting.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0121">Disclosed herbicidal combinations, such as compositions, according to the present application also can be preplant incorporated into soil after it is prepared for planting. Disclosed herbicidal combinations/compositions are incorporated to an effective soil depth, such as a depth of 1 to 2 inches. Herbicidal combinations/compositions according to the present invention can be used after crops are planted, such as by using a rolling cultivator.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0122">Disclosed herbicidal combinations/compositions also can be used as a post emergence treatment when crops and weeds are actively growing and preferably before weeds are more than 3-inches tall. It can be beneficial to delay application of disclosed herbicidal combinations/compositions until the majority of weeds are at a specified growth stage. The timing of application preferably may be based on weed size as opposed to crop growth stage.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0123">Furthermore, combinations/compositions according to the present invention can be applied in any manner, and for the same purposes, as are already known for mesotrione and oxyfluorfen. Mesotrione, for example, is a selective herbicide that can be applied to soil as an early pre-plant, pre-plant incorporated, pre-emergent or post-emergent treatment in various crops. The application method may depend upon the crop, anticipated weed spectrum and the preference of the applicator. For early pre-plant and pre-emergent treatments, susceptible weeds emerge, are present as stunted plants, and then die.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0124">Certain disclosed embodiments of the present invention are systemic and selective pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides for residual weed control. If used pre-emergence, weeds may take up the product through the soil during emergence. If used post-emergence, vulnerable weeds may take up the product through treated foliage and stop growing soon after application. For pre-emergence, suspension concentrates according to the present invention can be applied pre-emergence as a directed or shielded spray, and may be applied using a minimum carrier volume of 20 gallons/acre. For post-emergence, disclosed suspension concentrates according to the invention may be applied as a directed or shielded spray in a minimum spray volume of 40 gals./A with water as the carrier. Use a pump that will maintain pump pressure of 35-40 psi at the nozzles and provide proper agitation within the tank to keep the product dispersed. Lower pressures can be used with extended range or drift reduction nozzles. Non-ionic surfactants can be added to increase effectiveness. For example, 2 pints of 80% active nonionic surfactant maya be used per each 100 gallons of spray (0.25% v/v). Four pints of nonionic surfactant may enhance post-emergence activity when hard water (greater than 600 ppm minerals) is used.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0125">Use a sprayer in good operating condition with good agitation. Ensure that the sprayer is cleaned prior to using disclosed compositions. For post-emergence applications, use clean water only for the spray solution. Ensure that all in-line strainers and nozzle screens in the sprayer are 50-mesh or coarser. Liquid fertilizers are generally preferred, as opposed to suspension fertilizers, as the carrier for pre-emergence applications. Start filling spray tank or pre-mix tank with clean water and begin agitation. Maintain constant agitation. When sprayer or pre-mix tank is half full of water, add disclosed compositions and agitate until achieve complete dispersion. If tank mixing, add the tank mix product. Add any desired surfactant, if needed, and continue to fill tank to desired level with water.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0126">Disclosed herbicidal combinations can be used to control weeds for a number of crops, such as: citrus fruit, including Australian desert lime, Australian finger lime, Australian round lime, Brown River finger lime, calamondin, citron, citrus hybrids, grapefruit, Japanese summer grapefruit, kumquat, lemon, lime, Mediterranean mandarin, Mount white lime, New Guinea wild lime, sour orange, sweet orange, pummelo, Russell River lime, Satsuma mandarin, sweet lime, Tachibana orange, Tahiti lime, tangelo, tangerine (Mandarin), tangor, trifoliate orange, uniq fruit, cultivars, varieties and/or hybrids of these; stone fruits, such as apricot, Japanese apricot, Chinese jujube, nectarine, peach, plum, American plum, beach plum, Canada plum, cherry plum, Chickasaw plum, Damson plum, Japanese plum, Klamath plum, prune plum, plumcot, sloe, cultivars, varieties and/or hybrids of these; tree nuts, such as African nut-tree, almond, beech nut, Brazil nut, Brazilian pine, bunya, bur oak, butternut, Cajou nut, candlenut, cashew, chestnut, chinquapin, coconut, Coquito nut, Dika nut, ginkgo, Guiana chestnut, hazelnut (filbert), heartnut, hickory nut, Japanese horse-chestnut, macadamia nut, mongongo nut, monkey-pot, monkey puzzle nut, Okari nut, Pachira nut, peach palm nut, pecan, pequi, pili nut, pine nut, pistachio, Sapucaia nut, tropical almond, black walnut, English walnut, yellowhorn, cultivars, varieties and/or hybrids of these.
