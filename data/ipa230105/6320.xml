Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a power storage module provided in a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a power storage module in the related art, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-041708 (JP 2013-041708 A) describes a technology in which a projecting portion projecting toward a lateral side is provided in an upper end part of a side face of a spacer placed between power storage cells adjacent to each other, and an inclined surface is formed on the top face of the projecting portion such that the inclined surface is directed downward as it is distanced from the side face of the spacer. Hereby, foreign matter falling onto the projecting portion falls along the inclined surface, so that it is possible to restrain the foreign matter from being deposited on the projecting portion.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the power storage module described in JP 2013-041708 A, since the projecting portion has the inclined surface, it is possible to restrain foreign matter such as dust from being deposited on the projecting portion. However, the top face of the spacer is formed in a flat shape. Accordingly, in a case where liquid such as dew drop water reaches the top face of the spacer, the liquid cannot be moved, so that the liquid is accumulated on the top face of the spacer. In this case, the power storage cells adjacent to each other may make a short circuit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure is accomplished in view of the above problems, and an object of this disclosure is to provide a power storage module that can restrain a short circuit from being caused between power storage cells adjacent to each other in a case where liquid reaches between the power storage cells adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A power storage module according to this disclosure includes a first power storage cell, a second power storage cell, and a spacer. The first power storage cell and the second power storage cell are placed to be adjacent to each other, and the first power storage cell and the second power storage cell each include a housing having a top face and external terminals provided on the top face. The spacer has an insulating property and is placed between the housings adjacent to each other. The spacer includes a discharge portion via which liquid reaching the spacer from above is discharged to outside the spacer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above configuration, by providing the discharge portion in the spacer, it is possible to discharge liquid reaching the spacer from above to outside the spacer via the discharge portion. Hereby, it is possible to restrain a creepage distance between respective external terminals of the power storage cells adjacent to each other from decreasing due to accumulation of liquid. As a result, it is possible to secure an insulating property between the external terminals of the power storage cells adjacent to each other, thereby making it possible to restrain a short circuit from being caused between the power storage cells adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the power storage module according to this disclosure, the spacer may include a top face portion placed at a position lower than the top face of the housing. The top face portion may have an inclined surface inclined downward toward a first side in a direction perpendicular to the up-down direction and the arrangement direction where the first power storage cell and the second power storage cell are arranged. In this case, the discharge portion may be constituted by the inclined surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above configuration, the inclined surface is provided in the top face portion of the spacer. Hereby, even in a case where liquid reaches the top face portion of the spacer, it is possible to discharge liquid to outside the spacer via the inclined surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the power storage module according to this disclosure, the spacer may include one or more discharge channels communicating in the up-down direction. In this case, the discharge portion may be constituted by the one or more discharge channels. When a length of the housing in the direction perpendicular to the up-down direction and the arrangement direction where the first power storage cell and the second power storage cell are arranged is expressed as A (mm), a distance between the housings adjacent to each other in the arrangement direction is expressed as B (mm), and a total passage area of the one or more discharge channels on a section of the spacer that is perpendicular to the up-down direction is expressed as C (mm<sup>2</sup>), C/(A&#xd7;B) may be not less than 1% but not more than 50%.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above configuration, C/(A&#xd7;B) is set to be not less than 1% but not more than 50% as described above. Accordingly, it is possible to discharge liquid reaching the spacer from above to outside the spacer via the discharge portion. In addition, when an impact is input into the spacer from outside, it is possible to restrain the spacer from being damaged.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With this disclosure, it is possible to provide a power storage module that can restrain a short circuit from being caused between power storage cells adjacent to each other due to liquid when the liquid reaches between the power storage cells adjacent to each other.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like signs denote like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of a power storage module according to Embodiment 1;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in the power storage module according to Embodiment 1 and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to a comparative example and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view to describe a creepage distance between external terminals adjacent to each other in the power storage module according to the comparative example;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where liquid is accumulated on the top face of the spacer in the power storage module according to the comparative example;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to Embodiment 2 and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to Embodiment 3 and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top view partially illustrating the power storage module according to Embodiment 3;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to Embodiment 4 and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a top view partially illustrating the power storage module according to Embodiment 4;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to Embodiment 5 and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a view illustrating a spacer provided in a power storage module according to a reference example and a power storage cell placed behind the spacer when the spacer and the power storage module are viewed from the front side.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following describes embodiments of this disclosure in detail with reference to the drawings.
