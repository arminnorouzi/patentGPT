A number of systems are available that analyze the constituents of bodily fluids such as blood, urine and saliva. Examples of such systems may be configured to monitor the level of particular medically significant fluid constituents, such as, for example, cholesterol, ketones, vitamins, proteins, and various metabolites or blood sugars, such as glucose. Diagnosis and management of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, a disorder of the pancreas where insufficient production of insulin prevents normal regulation of blood sugar levels, generally requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels on a daily basis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of systems that allow individuals to easily monitor their blood glucose are currently available. For example, a person may obtain a blood sample by withdrawing blood from a blood source in his or her body, such as a vein, using a needle and syringe, for example, or by lancing a portion of his or her skin, using a lancing device, for example, to make blood available external to the skin, to obtain the necessary sample volume for in vitro testing. The person may then apply the blood sample to a test strip, whereupon suitable detection methods, such as calorimetric, electrochemical, or photometric detection methods, for example, may be used to determine the person's actual blood glucose level. The foregoing procedure provides a blood glucose concentration for a particular or discrete point in time, and thus, must be repeated periodically when the user actively initiates the procedure, in order to monitor blood glucose over a longer period.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the discrete or periodic, in vitro, blood glucose-monitoring systems described above, there are at least partially implantable, or in vivo, blood glucose-monitoring systems, which are constructed to provide continuous or automatic in vivo measurement of an individual's blood glucose concentration. Such in vivo analyte monitoring devices are constructed to provide for continuous or automatic monitoring of analytes, such as glucose, in the blood stream or interstitial fluid while the in vivo analyte monitoring device is positioned at least partially in the body of a user. Such devices include analyte sensors, e.g., electrochemical sensors, at least a portion of which are operably positioned in a blood vessel or in the subcutaneous tissue of a user, or elsewhere, for monitoring/detection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While continuous or automatic glucose monitoring is desirable, there are several challenges associated with manufacturing sensors constructed for in vivo use. In addition, attaching such sensors to other system components such as electronics units, e.g., sensor control units, poses additional challenges, particularly where two or more electrodes and their respective conductive traces are positioned on different surfaces of the sensor, e.g., on opposing substrate surfaces. Accordingly, further development of manufacturing techniques and methods, as well as analyte monitoring devices, systems, and kits employing the same, are desirable and provided herein.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Analyte sensor connectors that connect analyte sensors, e.g., conductive members of analyte sensors, to other devices such as sensor electronics units, e.g., sensor control units, are provided. Also provided are systems that include analyte sensors, analyte sensor connectors, and analyte sensor electronics units, as well as methods of establishing and maintaining connections between analyte sensors and analyte sensor electronics units, and methods of analyte monitoring/detection.

For example, where the analyte sensor includes at least an insulative base layer, an electrode, and an insulative layer, as described in greater detail below, the one or more sensor connectors may physically connect one or more of the insulative base layer, the electrode, and the insulative layer to the electronics unit.

In addition, use of a sensor connector, e.g., a rivet, allows for a relatively low temperature connection or attachment process. Such a process may be beneficial when compared with a higher temperature process which has the potential to negatively affect the sensor materials and/or sensing chemistry. For example, connecting a sensor with an electronics unit using an adhesive, such as ACF (anisotropic conductive film) or ACA (anisotropic conductive adhesive) may require high temperatures to create a bond.

A first insulative layer <b>54</b> covers a portion of conductive layer <b>52</b> and a second insulative layer <b>55</b> covers a portion of conductive layer <b>53</b>. First insulative layer <b>54</b> does not extend to the distal end of analyte sensor <b>50</b> leaving an exposed region of the conductive layer <b>52</b> which acts as the counter electrode. An insulative layer <b>55</b> covers a portion of conductive layer <b>53</b> leaving an exposed region of the conductive layer <b>53</b> where the sensing component or layer (not shown) is positioned. As discussed above, multiple spatially separated sensing components or layers may be provided in some embodiments. The insulative layer <b>57</b> on a first side, e.g., the bottom side of the sensor (in the view provided by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), may extend any suitable length of the sensor's distal section, i.e., it may extend the entire length of both of conductive layers <b>56</b> and <b>56</b>A or portions thereof.

For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, insulative layers <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> may be relatively thin relative to insulative substrate layer <b>51</b>. For example, insulative layers <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> may have a thickness in the range of 20-25 &#x3bc;m while substrate layer <b>51</b> has a thickness in the range of 0.1 to 0.15 mm. However, during singulation of the sensors where such singulation is accomplished by cutting through two or more conductive layers which are separated by such thin insulative layers, shorting between the two conductive layers may occur. One method of addressing this potential issue is to provide one of the conductive layers, e.g., electrodes layers, at least in part as a relatively narrow electrode, including, e.g., a relatively narrow conductive trace, such that during the singulation process the sensor is cut on either side of the narrow electrode such that one electrode is cut without cutting through the narrow electrode. See, for example, sensor assembly <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in which working electrode <b>502</b> is provided at its distal end as a relatively thin electrode relative to reference electrode <b>504</b>. In addition, one of the conductive layers may be spaced back from the other conductive layer at the distal end of the sensor. One of the sensors may extend, for example, to the distal tip of the sensor while the other terminates proximal to the distal tip of the sensor. In this manner, the sensor may be cut perpendicularly to the length of the sensor and across one of the conductive layers without cutting through two conductive layers separated by only a thin insulative layer, e.g., an insulative layer having a thickness from about 15 to 30 &#x3bc;m. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> the reference electrode <b>56</b> is spaced back distally relative to the working electrode <b>53</b>. However, this positioning could be reversed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As discussed above, the use of a sensor connector, e.g., a rivet, as a mechanism for attachment of an analyte sensor to an electronics unit, such as sensor control unit, e.g., to a PCB of the sensor control unit, may result in improved attachment of the analyte sensor to the sensor control unit as compared with other attachment methods, e.g., the use of one or more adhesives. The sensor connector, e.g., a rivet, may be made from a variety of suitable materials depending on the particular embodiment. For example, in some embodiments, the sensor connector, e.g., a rivet, physically connects the double-sided analyte sensor and the electronics unit. In other embodiments, the sensor connector, e.g., rivet physically and electrically connects the double-sided analyte sensor and the electronics unit. Where the sensor connector, e.g., rivet physically connects the analyte sensor and the electronics unit, the sensor connector, e.g., rivet may be made from any suitable conductive or non-conductive material. Where the sensor connector, e.g., rivet physically and electrically connects the double-sided analyte sensor and the electronics unit, the sensor connector, e.g., rivet, may be made from any suitable conductive material, e.g., copper. In one such embodiment, the sensor connector, e.g., rivet, may conduct an electrical signal from an electrode, including, e.g., a conductive trace, positioned on one side of the double-sided analyte sensor to the other side of the double-sided analyte sensor, e.g., for electrical connection with a PCB to which the double-sided analyte sensor is attached. In this way, both sides of a double-sided analyte sensor may be electrically connected to the sensor control unit. Where a plurality of electrodes is present, one or more of the plurality of electrodes may be electrically connected to the PCB via a corresponding conductive sensor connector, e.g., a conductive rivet. For example, an analyte sensor having three electrodes may include 1, 2 or 3 conductive sensor connectors, e.g., conductive rivets; an analyte sensor having four electrodes may include 1, 2, 3 or 4 conductive sensor connectors, e.g., conductive rivets; etc. Additional non-conductive and conductive sensor connector, e.g., rivet, materials are discussed in greater detail above.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">A double-sided analyte sensor may provide certain advantages over a single-sided analyte sensor.

The sensor response may be correlated and/or converted to analyte levels in blood or other fluids. In certain embodiments, an analyte sensor may be positioned in contact with interstitial fluid to detect the level of glucose, which detected glucose may be used to infer the glucose level in the user's bloodstream. Analyte sensors may be insertable into a vein, artery, or other portion of the body containing fluid. Embodiments of the analyte sensors may be configured for monitoring the level of the analyte over a time period which may range from seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, to months, or longer.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In certain embodiments, the analyte sensors, such as glucose sensors, are capable of in vivo detection of an analyte for one hour or more, e.g., a few hours or more, e.g., a few days or more, e.g., three or more days, e.g., five days or more, e.g., seven days or more such as fourteen days or more, e.g., several weeks or more such as 3 weeks or more, or one month or more. Future analyte levels may be predicted based on information obtained, e.g., the current analyte level at time t<sub>o</sub>, the rate of change of the analyte, etc. Predictive alarms may notify the user of a predicted analyte level that may be of concern in advance of the user's analyte level reaching the future predicted analyte level. This provides the user an opportunity to take corrective action.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Analytes that may be monitored include, but are not limited to, acetyl choline, amylase, bilirubin, cholesterol, chorionic gonadotropin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), creatine kinase (e.g., CK-MB), creatine, creatinine, DNA, fructosamine, glucose, glucose derivatives, glutamine, growth hormones, hormones, ketones, ketone bodies, lactate, peroxide, prostate-specific antigen, prothrombin, RNA, thyroid stimulating hormone, and troponin. The concentration of drugs, such as, for example, antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, vancomycin, and the like), digitoxin, digoxin, drugs of abuse, theophylline, and warfarin, may also be monitored. In embodiments that monitor more than one analyte, the analytes may be monitored at the same or different times.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Analyte sensors may include an analyte-responsive enzyme to provide a sensing element. Some analytes, such as oxygen, can be directly electrooxidized or electroreduced on a sensor, and more specifically at least on a working electrode of a sensor. Other analytes, such as glucose and lactate, require the presence of at least one electron transfer agent and/or at least one catalyst to facilitate the electrooxidation or electroreduction of the analyte. Catalysts may also be used for those analytes, such as oxygen, that can be directly electrooxidized or electroreduced on the working electrode. For these analytes, each working electrode includes a sensing element proximate to or on a surface of a working electrode. In many embodiments, a sensing element is formed near or on only a small portion of at least a working electrode.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Each sensing element includes one or more components constructed to facilitate the electrochemical oxidation or reduction of the analyte. The sensing element may include, for example, a catalyst to catalyze a reaction of the analyte and produce a response at the working electrode, an electron transfer agent to transfer electrons between the analyte and the working electrode (or other component), or both.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">A variety of different sensing element configurations may be used. In certain embodiments, the sensing elements are deposited on the conductive material of a working electrode. The sensing elements may extend beyond the conductive material of the working electrode. In some cases, the sensing elements may also extend over other electrodes, e.g., over the counter electrode and/or reference electrode (or counter/reference where provided). In other embodiments, the sensing elements are contained on the working electrode, such that the sensing elements do not extend beyond the conductive material of the working electrode. In some embodiments a working electrode is configured to include a plurality of spatially distinct sensing elements. Additional information related to the use of spatially distinct sensing elements can be found in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/421,371, entitled &#x201c;Analyte Sensors with Reduced Sensitivity Variation,&#x201d; which was filed on Dec. 9, 2010, and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The terms &#x201c;working electrode&#x201d;, &#x201c;counter electrode&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference electrode&#x201d; and &#x201c;counter/reference electrode&#x201d; are used herein to refer to conductive sensor components, including, e.g., conductive traces, which are configured to function as a working electrode, counter electrode, reference electrode or a counter/reference electrode respectively. For example, a working electrode includes that portion of a conductive material, e.g., a conductive trace, which functions as a working electrode as described herein, e.g., that portion of a conductive material which is exposed to an environment containing the analyte or analytes to be measured, and which, in some cases, has been modified with one or more sensing elements as described herein Similarly, a reference electrode includes that portion of a conductive material, e.g., conductive trace, which function as a reference electrode as described herein, e.g., that portion of a conductive material which is exposed to an environment containing the analyte or analytes to be measured, and which, in some cases, includes a secondary conductive layer, e.g., a Ag/AgCl layer. A counter electrode includes that portion of a conductive material, e.g., conductive trace which is configured to function as a counter electrode as described herein, e.g., that portion of a conductive trace which is exposed to an environment containing the analyte or analytes to be measured. As noted above, in some embodiments, a portion of a conductive material, e.g., conductive trace, may function as either or both of a counter electrode and a reference electrode. In addition, &#x201c;working electrodes&#x201d;, &#x201c;counter electrodes&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference electrodes&#x201d; and &#x201c;counter/reference electrodes&#x201d; may include portions, e.g., conductive traces, electrical contacts, or areas or portions thereof, which do not include sensing elements, but which are used to electrically connect the electrodes to other electrical components.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Sensing elements that are in direct contact with the working electrode, e.g., the working electrode trace, may contain an electron transfer agent to transfer electrons directly or indirectly between the analyte and the working electrode, and/or a catalyst to facilitate a reaction of the analyte. For example, a glucose, lactate, or oxygen electrode may be formed having sensing elements which contain a catalyst, including glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, lactate oxidase, or laccase, respectively, and an electron transfer agent that facilitates the electrooxidation of the glucose, lactate, or oxygen, respectively.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In other embodiments the sensing elements are not deposited directly on the working electrode, e.g., the working electrode trace. Instead, the sensing elements may be spaced apart from the working electrode trace, and separated from the working electrode trace, e.g., by a separation layer. A separation layer may include one or more membranes or films or a physical distance. In addition to separating the working electrode trace from the sensing elements, the separation layer may also act as a mass transport limiting layer and/or an interferent eliminating layer and/or a biocompatible layer.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In certain embodiments which include more than one working electrode, one or more of the working electrodes may not have corresponding sensing elements, or may have sensing elements that do not contain one or more components (e.g., an electron transfer agent and/or catalyst) needed to electrolyze the analyte. Thus, the signal at this working electrode may correspond to background signal which may be removed from the analyte signal obtained from one or more other working electrodes that are associated with fully-functional sensing elements by, for example, subtracting the signal.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In certain embodiments, the sensing elements include one or more electron transfer agents. Electron transfer agents that may be employed are electroreducible and electrooxidizable ions or molecules having redox potentials that are a few hundred millivolts above or below the redox potential of the standard calomel electrode (SCE). The electron transfer agent may be organic, organometallic, or inorganic. Examples of organic redox species are quinones and species that in their oxidized state have quinoid structures, such as Nile blue and indophenol. Examples of organometallic redox species are metallocenes including ferrocene. Examples of inorganic redox species are hexacyanoferrate (III), ruthenium hexamine, etc. Additional examples include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,736,957, 7,501,053 and 7,754,093, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In certain embodiments, electron transfer agents have structures or charges which prevent or substantially reduce the diffusional loss of the electron transfer agent during the period of time that the sample is being analyzed. For example, electron transfer agents include but are not limited to a redox species, e.g., bound to a polymer which can in turn be disposed on or near the working electrode. The bond between the redox species and the polymer may be covalent, coordinative, or ionic. Although any organic, organometallic or inorganic redox species may be bound to a polymer and used as an electron transfer agent, in certain embodiments the redox species is a transition metal compound or complex, e.g., osmium, ruthenium, iron, and cobalt compounds or complexes. It will be recognized that many redox species described for use with a polymeric component may also be used, without a polymeric component.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Embodiments of polymeric electron transfer agents may contain a redox species covalently bound in a polymeric composition. An example of this type of mediator is poly(vinylferrocene). Another type of electron transfer agent contains an ionically-bound redox species. This type of mediator may include a charged polymer coupled to an oppositely charged redox species. Examples of this type of mediator include a negatively charged polymer coupled to a positively charged redox species such as an osmium or ruthenium polypyridyl cation. Another example of an ionically-bound mediator is a positively charged polymer including quaternized poly(4-vinyl pyridine) or poly(1-vinyl imidazole) coupled to a negatively charged redox species such as ferricyanide or ferrocyanide. In other embodiments, electron transfer agents include a redox species coordinatively bound to a polymer. For example, the mediator may be formed by coordination of an osmium or cobalt 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridyl complex to poly(1-vinyl imidazole) or poly(4-vinyl pyridine).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Suitable electron transfer agents are osmium transition metal complexes with one or more ligands, each ligand having a nitrogen-containing heterocycle such as 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, 1-methyl, 2-pyridyl biimidazole, or derivatives thereof. The electron transfer agents may also have one or more ligands covalently bound in a polymer, each ligand having at least one nitrogen-containing heterocycle, such as pyridine, imidazole, or derivatives thereof. One example of an electron transfer agent includes (a) a polymer or copolymer having pyridine or imidazole functional groups and (b) osmium cations complexed with two ligands, each ligand containing 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, or derivatives thereof, the two ligands not necessarily being the same. Some derivatives of 2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine for complexation with the osmium cation include but are not limited to 4,4&#x2032;-dimethyl-2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine and mono-, di-, and polyalkoxy-2,2&#x2032;-bipyridines, including 4,4&#x2032;-dimethoxy-2,2&#x2032;-bipyridine. Derivatives of 1,10-phenanthroline for complexation with the osmium cation include but are not limited to 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and mono, di-, and polyalkoxy-1,10-phenanthrolines, such as 4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline. Polymers for complexation with the osmium cation include but are not limited to polymers and copolymers of poly(1-vinyl imidazole) (referred to as &#x201c;PVI&#x201d;) and poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (referred to as &#x201c;PVP&#x201d;). Suitable copolymer substituents of poly(1-vinyl imidazole) include acrylonitrile, acrylamide, and substituted or quaternized N-vinyl imidazole, e.g., electron transfer agents with osmium complexed to a polymer or copolymer of poly(1-vinyl imidazole).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Embodiments may employ electron transfer agents having a redox potential ranging from about &#x2212;200 mV to about +200 mV versus the standard calomel electrode (SCE). The sensing elements may also include a catalyst which is capable of catalyzing a reaction of the analyte. The catalyst may also, in some embodiments, act as an electron transfer agent. One example of a suitable catalyst is an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction of the analyte. For example, a catalyst, including a glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase (e.g., pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), dependent glucose dehydrogenase, flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent glucose dehydrogenase, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) dependent glucose dehydrogenase), may be used when the analyte of interest is glucose. A lactate oxidase or lactate dehydrogenase may be used when the analyte of interest is lactate. Laccase may be used when the analyte of interest is oxygen or when oxygen is generated or consumed in response to a reaction of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In certain embodiments, a catalyst may be attached to a polymer, cross linking the catalyst with another electron transfer agent, which, as described above, may be polymeric. A second catalyst may also be used in certain embodiments. This second catalyst may be used to catalyze a reaction of a product compound resulting from the catalyzed reaction of the analyte. The second catalyst may operate with an electron transfer agent to electrolyze the product compound to generate a signal at the working electrode. Alternatively, a second catalyst may be provided in an interferent-eliminating layer to catalyze reactions that remove interferents.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In certain embodiments, the sensor works at a low oxidizing potential, e.g., a potential of about +40 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. This sensing elements use, for example, an osmium (Os)-based mediator constructed for low potential operation. Accordingly, in certain embodiments the sensing elements are redox active components that include: (1) osmium-based mediator molecules that include (bidente) ligands, and (2) glucose oxidase enzyme molecules. These two constituents are combined together in the sensing elements of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">A mass transport limiting layer (not shown), e.g., an analyte flux modulating layer, may be included with the sensor to act as a diffusion-limiting barrier to reduce the rate of mass transport of the analyte, for example, glucose or lactate, into the region around the working electrodes. The mass transport limiting layers are useful in limiting the flux of an analyte to a working electrode in an electrochemical sensor so that the sensor is linearly responsive over a large range of analyte concentrations and is easily calibrated. Mass transport limiting layers may include polymers and may be biocompatible. A mass transport limiting layer may provide many functions, e.g., biocompatibility and/or interferent-eliminating functions, etc.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">A mass transport limiting layer may be applied to an analyte sensor as described herein via any of a variety of suitable methods, including, e.g., dip coating and slot die coating.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In certain embodiments, a mass transport limiting layer is a membrane composed of crosslinked polymers containing heterocyclic nitrogen groups, such as polymers of polyvinylpyridine and polyvinylimidazole. Embodiments also include membranes that are made of a polyurethane, or polyether urethane, or chemically related material, or membranes that are made of silicone, and the like.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">A membrane may be formed by crosslinking in situ a polymer, modified with a zwitterionic moiety, a non-pyridine copolymer component, and optionally another moiety that is either hydrophilic or hydrophobic, and/or has other desirable properties, in an alcohol-buffer solution. The modified polymer may be made from a precursor polymer containing heterocyclic nitrogen groups. For example, a precursor polymer may be polyvinylpyridine or polyvinylimidazole. Optionally, hydrophilic or hydrophobic modifiers may be used to &#x201c;fine-tune&#x201d; the permeability of the resulting membrane to an analyte of interest. Optional hydrophilic modifiers, such as poly(ethylene glycol), hydroxyl or polyhydroxyl modifiers, may be used to enhance the biocompatibility of the polymer or the resulting membrane.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">A membrane may be formed in situ by applying an alcohol-buffer solution of a crosslinker and a modified polymer over the enzyme-containing sensing elements and allowing the solution to cure for about one to two days or other appropriate time period. The crosslinker-polymer solution may be applied over the sensing elements by placing a droplet or droplets of the membrane solution on the sensor, by dipping the sensor into the membrane solution, by spraying the membrane solution on the sensor, and the like. Generally, the thickness of the membrane is controlled by the concentration of the membrane solution, by the number of droplets of the membrane solution applied, by the number of times the sensor is dipped in the membrane solution, by the volume of membrane solution sprayed on the sensor, or by any combination of these factors. In order to coat the distal and side edges of the sensor, the membrane material may have to be applied subsequent to singulation of the sensor precursors. In some embodiments, the analyte sensor is dip-coated following singulation to apply one or more membranes. Alternatively, the analyte sensor could be slot-die coated wherein each side of the analyte sensor is coated separately. A membrane applied in the above manner may have any combination of the following functions: (1) mass transport limitation, i.e., reduction of the flux of analyte that can reach the sensing elements, (2) biocompatibility enhancement, or (3) interferent reduction.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, a membrane composition for use as a mass transport limiting layer may include one or more leveling agents, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Additional information with respect to the use of leveling agents can be found, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2010/0081905, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some instances, the membrane may form one or more bonds with the sensing elements. By bonds is meant any type of an interaction between atoms or molecules that allows chemical compounds to form associations with each other, such as, but not limited to, covalent bonds, ionic bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, London dispersion forces, and the like. For example, in situ polymerization of the membrane can form crosslinks between the polymers of the membrane and the polymers in the sensing elements. In certain embodiments, crosslinking of the membrane to the sensing element facilitates a reduction in the occurrence of delamination of the membrane from the sensor.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In certain embodiments, the sensing system detects hydrogen peroxide to infer glucose levels. For example, a hydrogen peroxide-detecting sensor may be constructed in which the sensing elements include an enzyme such as glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, or the like, and is positioned on the working electrode. The sensing elements may be covered by one or more layers, e.g., a membrane that is selectively permeable to glucose. Once the glucose passes through the membrane, it is oxidized by the enzyme and reduced glucose oxidase can then be oxidized by reacting with molecular oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Certain embodiments include a hydrogen peroxide-detecting sensor constructed from sensing elements prepared by combining together, for example: (1) a redox mediator having a transition metal complex including an Os polypyridyl complex with oxidation potentials of about +200 mV vs. SCE, and (2) periodate oxidized horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Such a sensor functions in a reductive mode; the working electrode is controlled at a potential negative to that of the Os complex, resulting in mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide through the HRP catalyst.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In another example, a potentiometric sensor can be constructed as follows. Glucose-sensing elements may be constructed by combining together (1) a redox mediator having a transition metal complex including Os polypyridyl complexes with oxidation potentials from about &#x2212;200 mV to +200 mV vs. SCE, and (2) glucose oxidase. This sensor can then be used in a potentiometric mode, by exposing the sensor to a glucose containing solution, under conditions of zero current flow, and allowing the ratio of reduced/oxidized Os to reach an equilibrium value. The reduced/oxidized Os ratio varies in a reproducible way with the glucose concentration, and will cause the electrode's potential to vary in a similar way.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The substrate may be formed using a variety of non-conducting materials, including, for example, polymeric or plastic materials and ceramic materials. Suitable materials for a particular sensor may be determined, at least in part, based on the desired use of the sensor and properties of the materials.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, the substrate is flexible. For example, if the sensor is configured for implantation into a user, then the sensor may be made flexible (although rigid sensors may also be used for implantable sensors) to reduce pain to the user and damage to the tissue caused by the implantation of and/or the wearing of the sensor. A flexible substrate often increases the user's comfort and allows a wider range of activities. Suitable materials for a flexible substrate include, for example, non-conducting plastic or polymeric materials and other non-conducting, flexible, deformable materials. Examples of useful plastic or polymeric materials include thermoplastics such as polycarbonates, polyesters (e.g., Mylar&#x2122; and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethanes, polyethers, polyamides, polyimides, or copolymers of these thermoplastics, such as PETG (glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In other embodiments, the sensors are made using a relatively rigid substrate to, for example, provide structural support against bending or breaking. Examples of rigid materials that may be used as the substrate include poorly conducting ceramics, such as aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide. An implantable sensor having a rigid substrate may have a sharp point and/or a sharp edge to aid in implantation of a sensor without an additional insertion device.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">It will be appreciated that for many sensors and sensor applications, both rigid and flexible sensors will operate adequately. The flexibility of the sensor may also be controlled and varied along a continuum by changing, for example, the composition and/or thickness of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In addition to considerations regarding flexibility, it is often desirable that implantable sensors should have a substrate which is physiologically harmless, for example, a substrate approved by a regulatory agency or private institution for in vivo use.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The sensor may include optional features to facilitate insertion of an implantable sensor. For example, the sensor may be pointed at the tip to ease insertion. In addition, the sensor may include a barb which assists in anchoring the sensor within the tissue of the user during operation of the sensor. However, the barb is typically small enough so that little damage is caused to the subcutaneous tissue when the sensor is removed for replacement.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">An implantable sensor may also, optionally, have an anticlotting agent disposed on a portion of the substrate which is implanted into a user. This anticlotting agent may reduce or eliminate the clotting of blood or other body fluid around the sensor, particularly after insertion of the sensor. Blood clots may foul the sensor or irreproducibly reduce the amount of analyte which diffuses into the sensor. Examples of useful anticlotting agents include heparin and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), as well as other known anticlotting agents.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The anticlotting agent may be applied to at least a portion of that part of the sensor that is to be implanted. The anticlotting agent may be applied, for example, by bath, spraying, brushing, or dipping, etc. The anticlotting agent is allowed to dry on the sensor. The anticlotting agent may be immobilized on the surface of the sensor or it may be allowed to diffuse away from the sensor surface. The quantities of anticlotting agent disposed on the sensor may be below the amounts typically used for treatment of medical conditions involving blood clots and, therefore, have only a limited, localized effect.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> schematically shows an analyte sensor <b>400</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure.

The electronic components of the sensor electronics unit typically include a power supply for operating the sensor control unit and the sensor, a sensor circuit for obtaining signals from and operating the sensor, a measurement circuit that converts sensor signals to a desired format, and a processing circuit that, at minimum, obtains signals from the sensor circuit and/or measurement circuit and provides the signals to an optional transmitter. In some embodiments, the processing circuit may also partially or completely evaluate the signals from the sensor and convey the resulting data to an optional transmitter and/or activate an optional alarm system if the analyte level exceeds a threshold. The processing circuit often includes digital logic circuitry.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">The sensor electronics unit may optionally contain a transmitter for transmitting the sensor signals or processed data from the processing circuit to a receiver/display unit; a data storage unit for temporarily or permanently storing data from the processing circuit; a temperature probe circuit for receiving signals from and operating a temperature probe; a reference voltage generator for providing a reference voltage for comparison with sensor-generated signals; and/or a watchdog circuit that monitors the operation of the electronic components in the sensor electronics unit. In some embodiments, the sensor electronics unit includes an RFID sensor or reader.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Moreover, the sensor electronics unit may also include digital and/or analog components utilizing semiconductor devices, including transistors. To operate these semiconductor devices, the sensor control unit may include other components including, for example, a bias control generator to correctly bias analog and digital semiconductor devices, an oscillator to provide a clock signal, and a digital logic and timing component to provide timing signals and logic operations for the digital components of the circuit.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">As an example of the operation of these components, the sensor circuit and the optional temperature probe circuit provide raw signals from the sensor to the measurement circuit. The measurement circuit converts the raw signals to a desired format, using for example, a current-to-voltage converter, current-to-frequency converter, and/or a binary counter or other indicator that produces a signal proportional to the absolute value of the raw signal. This may be used, for example, to convert the raw signal to a format that can be used by digital logic circuits. The processing circuit may then, optionally, evaluate the data and provide commands to operate the electronics.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Calibration</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Sensors may be configured to require no system calibration or no user calibration. For example, a sensor may be factory calibrated and need not require further calibrating. In certain embodiments, calibration may be required, but may be done without user intervention, i.e., may be automatic. In those embodiments in which calibration by the user is required, the calibration may be according to a predetermined schedule or may be dynamic, i.e., the time for which may be determined by the system on a real-time basis according to various factors, including, but not limited to, glucose concentration and/or temperature and/or rate of change of glucose, etc.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">In addition to a transmitter, an optional receiver may be included in the sensor control unit. In some cases, the transmitter is a transceiver, operating as both a transmitter and a receiver. The receiver may be used to receive calibration data for the sensor. The calibration data may be used by the processing circuit to correct signals from the sensor. This calibration data may be transmitted by the receiver/display unit or from some other source such as a control unit in a doctor's office. In addition, the optional receiver may be used to receive a signal from the receiver/display units to direct the transmitter, for example, to change frequencies or frequency bands, to activate or deactivate the optional alarm system and/or to direct the transmitter to transmit at a higher rate.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Calibration data may be obtained in a variety of ways. For instance, the calibration data may be factory-determined calibration measurements which can be input into the sensor control unit using the receiver or may alternatively be stored in a calibration data storage unit within the sensor control unit itself (in which case a receiver may not be needed). The calibration data storage unit may be, for example, a readable or readable/writeable memory circuit. In some cases, a system may only need to be calibrated once during the manufacturing process, where recalibration of the system is not required.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">If necessary, calibration may be accomplished using an in vitro test strip (or other reference), e.g., a small sample test strip such as a test strip that requires less than about 1 microliter of sample (for example Freestyle&#xae; or Precision&#x2122; blood glucose monitoring test strips from Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, Calif.). For example, test strips that require less than about 1 nanoliter of sample may be used. In certain embodiments, a sensor may be calibrated using only one sample of body fluid per calibration event. For example, a user need only lance a body part one time to obtain a sample for a calibration event (e.g., for a test strip), or may lance more than one time within a short period of time if an insufficient volume of sample is firstly obtained. Embodiments include obtaining and using multiple samples of body fluid for a given calibration event, where glucose values of each sample are substantially similar. Data obtained from a given calibration event may be used independently to calibrate or combined with data obtained from previous calibration events, e.g., averaged including weighted averaged, etc., to calibrate. In certain embodiments, a system need only be calibrated once by a user, where recalibration of the system is not required.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Alternative or additional calibration data may be provided based on tests performed by a health care professional or by the user. For example, it is common for diabetic individuals to determine their own blood glucose concentration using commercially available testing kits. The results of this test is input into the sensor control unit either directly, if an appropriate input device (e.g., a keypad, an optical signal receiver, or a port for connection to a keypad or computer) is incorporated in the sensor control unit, or indirectly by inputting the calibration data into the receiver/display unit and transmitting the calibration data to the sensor control unit.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Other methods of independently determining analyte levels may also be used to obtain calibration data. This type of calibration data may supplant or supplement factory-determined calibration values.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">In some embodiments of the invention, calibration data may be required at periodic intervals, for example, every eight hours, once a day, or once a week, to confirm that accurate analyte levels are being reported. Calibration may also be required each time a new sensor is implanted or if the sensor exceeds a threshold minimum or maximum value or if the rate of change in the sensor signal exceeds a threshold value. In some cases, it may be necessary to wait a period of time after the implantation of the sensor before calibrating to allow the sensor to achieve equilibrium. In some embodiments, the sensor is calibrated only after it has been inserted. In other embodiments, no calibration of the sensor is needed.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Analyte Monitoring Device</heading><p id="p-0199" num="0198">In some embodiments of the invention, an analyte monitoring device is provided which includes a sensor electronics unit, such as a sensor control unit, and a sensor. In these embodiments, the processing circuit of the sensor electronics unit may be configured to determine a level of the analyte and activate an alarm system if the analyte level exceeds a threshold value. The sensor electronics unit, in these embodiments, may include an alarm system and may also include a display, such as an LCD or LED display.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">A threshold value is exceeded if the datapoint has a value that is beyond the threshold value in a direction indicating a particular condition. For example, a datapoint which correlates to a glucose level of 200 mg/dL exceeds a threshold value for hyperglycemia of 180 mg/dL, because the datapoint indicates that the user has entered a hyperglycemic state. As another example, a datapoint which correlates to a glucose level of 65 mg/dL exceeds a threshold value for hypoglycemia of 70 mg/dL because the datapoint indicates that the user is hypoglycemic as defined by the threshold value. However, a datapoint which correlates to a glucose level of 75 mg/dL would not exceed the same threshold value of 70 mg/dL for hypoglycemia because the datapoint does not indicate that particular condition as defined by the chosen threshold value.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">An alarm may also be activated if the sensor readings indicate a value that is outside of (e.g., above or below) a measurement range of the sensor. For glucose, the physiologically relevant measurement range is typically 40-500 mg/dL, including 40-300 mg/dL and 50-250 mg/dL, of glucose in the interstitial fluid, and 20-500 mg/dL in blood.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The alarm system may also, or alternatively, be activated when the rate of change or acceleration of the rate of change in analyte level increase or decrease reaches or exceeds a threshold rate or acceleration. For example, in the case of a subcutaneous glucose monitor, the alarm system may be activated if the rate of change in glucose concentration exceeds a threshold value which may indicate that a hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic condition is likely to occur. In some cases, the alarm system is activated if the acceleration of the rate of change in glucose concentration exceeds a threshold value which may indicate that a hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic condition is likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">A system may also include system alarms that notify a user of system information such as battery condition, calibration, sensor dislodgment, sensor malfunction, etc. Alarms may be, for example, auditory and/or visual. Other sensory-stimulating alarm systems may be used including alarm systems which heat, cool, vibrate, or produce a mild electrical shock when activated.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Drug Delivery System</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0203">The subject invention also includes sensors and associated devices used in sensor-based drug delivery systems. The system may provide a drug to counteract the high or low level of the analyte in response to the signals from one or more sensors. Alternatively, the system may monitor the drug concentration to ensure that the drug remains within a desired therapeutic range. The drug delivery system may include one or more (e.g., two or more) sensors, a processing unit such as a transmitter, a receiver/display unit, and a drug administration system. In some cases, some or all components may be integrated in a single unit. A sensor-based drug delivery system may use data from the one or more sensors to provide necessary input for a control algorithm/mechanism to adjust the administration of drugs, e.g., automatically or semi-automatically. As an example, a glucose sensor may be used to control and adjust the administration of insulin from an external or implanted insulin pump.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Fiducial Mark</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0204">A fiducial mark may be provided in connection with the manufacture of an analyte sensor, e.g., on a substrate layer of the analyte sensor. The fiducial mark provides a means by which the location of the electrode, e.g., the electrode trace, may be identified and/or located during the manufacturing process, e.g., to facilitate a singulation step.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Insertion Device</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0205">An insertion device can be used to subcutaneously insert the sensor into the user. The insertion device is typically formed using structurally rigid materials, such as metal or rigid plastic. Materials may include stainless steel and ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) plastic. In some embodiments, the insertion device is pointed and/or sharp at the tip to facilitate penetration of the skin of the user. A sharp, thin insertion device may reduce pain felt by the user upon insertion of the sensor. In other embodiments, the tip of the insertion device has other shapes, including a blunt or flat shape. These embodiments may be useful when the insertion device does not penetrate the skin but rather serves as a structural support for the sensor as the sensor is pushed into the skin.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In one embodiment, a sensor insertion device <b>901</b> is provided as a component of a sensor control unit insertion assembly <b>900</b>.
