The present disclosure further relates to a wireless communication system, a terminal, a base station and a computer program for use in said method.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Particularly, but not exclusively, the present disclosure relates to techniques for assisting a terminal in synchronizing with a cell in a &#x201c;5G&#x201d; wireless communication system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication systems are widely known in which terminals (also called user equipments or UEs, subscriber or mobile stations) communicate with base stations (BSs) within communication range of the terminals.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At a given carrier frequency the different geographical areas served by one or more base stations are generally referred to as cells, and typically many BSs are provided in appropriate geographical locations so as to form a network covering a wide geographical area more or less seamlessly with adjacent and/or overlapping cells. (In this specification, the terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; are used synonymously). Each BS may support one or more cells and in each cell, the BS divides the available bandwidth, i.e. frequency and time resources, into individual resource allocations for the user equipments which it serves. The fundamental divisions of resource allocation are the subcarrier spacing (in the frequency domain) and the symbol duration (in the time domain). Subcarriers and symbols form resource elements (REs) which are grouped into Resource Blocks (RBs). The subcarriers are arranged with respect to the carrier frequency and the symbols are arranged with respect to a frame timing. In this way, a signal transmitted in the cell and scheduled by the BS occupies a specific resource which may be characterised by a location in the frequency domain and a location in the time domain. A terminal may be in range of (i.e. able to detect signals from and/or communicate with) several cells at the same time, but in the simplest case it communicates with one &#x201c;serving&#x201d; cell.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In current, &#x201c;4G&#x201d; systems, also known as LTE or LTE-A, a terminal has to perform cell search and synchronization in order to connect to a cell. For this purpose, each cell broadcasts synchronization signals referred to as the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS/SSS). These signals, which are transmitted at the carrier frequency, establish a timing reference for the cell, and carry a physical layer cell identity and physical layer cell identity group for identifying the cell. In more detail, PSS is used to achieve subframe, slot and symbol synchronization in the time domain; and to narrow down the possible Physical layer Cell Identity (PCI) of the cell. PCI are organised into 168 groups of 3, and the Primary Synchronization Signal provides a pointer to the position of the PCI within the group but does not identify the group itself. SSS is used to achieve radio frame synchronization (PSS alone is insufficient for this, as PSS is transmitted identically twice in a frame), and identifies the PCI group so the PCI can be deduced when combined with the pointer from the PSS.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an LTE system, in the frequency domain, transmissions occur within at least one frequency band assigned to the system operator. The range of frequencies used to provide a given cell (referred to below as a &#x201c;frequency span&#x201d;) are generally a subset of those within the assigned frequency band. In the time domain, transmission is organized in &#x201c;frames&#x201d; which are subdivided into &#x201c;subframes&#x201d;. In one frame structure used in LTE, a 10 ms frame is divided into 10 subframes each of 1 ms duration. In LTE, each of the PSS and SSS is transmitted twice per frame, in other words with a 5 ms periodicity (and consequently, only in some subframes). For example, PSS and SSS are both transmitted on the first and sixth subframe of every frame. LTE employs OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) for the air interface. It is expected that 5G systems will also employ OFDM and variants thereof. The OFDM configuration in terms of particular values for sub-carrier spacing, symbol duration, cyclic prefix, and other parameters for a given frequency band is referred to as a &#x201c;numerology&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In LTE specifications, a terminal can be considered as either synchronized or unsynchronized with respect to a cell. As noted above, successfully decoding the PSS and SSS allows a terminal to obtain synchronization information, including downlink subframe timing and cell ID for a cell; in other words the terminal becomes &#x201c;synchronized&#x201d; with the cell. In the synchronized state, the terminal can decode system information including a Master Information Block (MIB) contained in a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH) broadcast by the cell. The terminal can then begin to receive user data (packets) on a downlink from the cell, and/or, typically after some further protocol steps, transmit user data on an uplink using the cell.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A terminal typically needs to measure characteristics of radio communication channels between itself and a given cell in order to provide appropriate feedback to that cell. To facilitate measurements of the channel by terminals, reference signals are transmitted by the cells. The process of a terminal making measurements on reference signals and reporting the measurements to a BS is part of Radio Resource Management, RRM.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Nowadays mobile access to Internet or another mobile point is becoming a crucial necessity for both business and personal life and there are significant challenges to the current wireless systems due to the popularity of new applications such as social networking, cloud based services and big data analysis. With the forthcoming services such as Internet of things and ultra-reliable, mission-critical connections, a next-generation system to succeed LTE/LTE-A and known as &#x201c;5G&#x201d; or &#x201c;NR&#x201d; (New Radio) will be needed to satisfy all those demanding requirements.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The next generation mobile network, 5G, together with its eco system, is targeted to be rolled out by 2020 in order to overcome the inadequacies of LTE/LTE-A.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Simultaneous requirements to be met comprise greatly increased traffic; many more devices; reduced latency; low-power and low-cost solutions for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices; and increased peak and guaranteed data rates. The intention of 5G is to satisfy all requirements of these applications and ideally, 5G could provide at least the following features:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">Ultra-reliable connection in addition to higher data rate, higher capacity and higher spectral efficiency</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">Unified user experience together with significant reduction on latency</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">Scalability/adaptability to applications with significant different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">Access all spectrum and bands and support different spectrum sharing schemes</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">From a traffic profiles point of view, it is expected that 5G will support at least three profiles with significant different properties, namely:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">(i) high throughput with high mobility traffic;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">(ii) low-energy consumption and long lived sensor-based services; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">(iii) extremely low latency and high reliability services.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">From the industry point of view, 5G will not only provide traditional voice and data services but also expand and penetrate to other industries such as automotive, agriculture, city management, healthcare, energy, public transportation etc., and all these will lead to a large ecosystem which has never been experienced before.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The technical challenges for designing such a sophisticated and complicated system are tremendous and significant breakthroughs will be required both on the network side and in the radio interface. Regarding the physical layer of the radio interface, new techniques will be introduced in order to support aforementioned 5G requirements. One important objective of studies in 3GPP (see for example the 3GPP discussion document RP-160671, New SID Proposal: Study on New Radio Access Technology, NTT DOCOMO) is to investigate fundamental physical layer designs such as waveform design, basic numerology and frame structure, channel coding scheme(s) and so on for meeting key 5G requirements.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Of particular relevance to the present disclosure is the impact of the available frequency spectrum available to the system, which may be a combination of multiple frequency bands. In the longer term, it is expected that much more spectrum will be available to meet traffic demand. To date, spectrum for mobile communication has focused on frequencies below 6 GHz. In the time frame of 2020 to 2030, more spectrum at higher frequencies such as 6 GHz, 10 GHz or even up to 100 GHz will be considered. At the same time wider frequency bands will be available at these extreme higher frequencies. More detailed information is provided in Table 1 (source: Ofcom, &#x201c;Spectrum above 6 GHz for future mobile communications&#x201d;, February 2015).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Possible spectrum allocation for 5G and beyond</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="210pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Spectrum</entry><entry>Possible allocation</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="210pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>5</entry><entry>GHz</entry><entry>This band is being considered at the ITU World Radio Conference in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>2015 (WRC-15) - in total over 300 MHz in new spectrum could be</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>allocated</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>If agreed at WRC-15, a contiguous band from 5150 to 5925 MHz</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>would be created using a combination of existing and new spectrum</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Channel sizes likely based on current Wi-Fi use, in multiples of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>20 MHz, and the band may remain as a licence-exempt band in line</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>with current Wi-Fi</entry></row><row><entry>15</entry><entry>GHz</entry><entry>Potentially over 500 MHz contiguous spectrum depending on the sub-</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>band used and sharing with existing uses</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Very high speeds are achievable - for example, peak speeds of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>5 Gbps have been demonstrated already</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Channel sizes could be very wide, for example, multiples of 100 MHz</entry></row><row><entry>28</entry><entry>GHz</entry><entry>Similar to the 15 GHz band, for example, over contiguous 500 MHz of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>spectrum depending on the sub-band used and sharing with existing</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>uses</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Channel sizes could be very wide, for example, multiples of 100 MHz</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Depending on the bandwidth available, the band could accommodate</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>multiple operators with the opportunity for companies other than</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>established mobile operators to offer some 5G services with an</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>assignment of 100 MHz per operator, or more, depending on national</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>availability and sharing with existing services.</entry></row><row><entry>60-80</entry><entry>GHz</entry><entry>Potentially up to 5 GHz of contiguous spectrum depending on the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>selected sub-band (for example, 71-76 MHz and/or 81-86 GHz)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Channel sizes could be very wide, for example, multiples of 100 MHz</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Depending on the bandwidth available, the band could accommodate</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>multiple operators with the opportunity for companies other than</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>established mobile operators to offer some 5G services with a</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>100 MHz assignment per operator, or more, depending on national</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>availability and sharing with existing services.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">Practical 5G systems will typically employ subranges of the employed bands assigned to different operators, where each subrange is referred to as a system bandwidth or frequency span. Terminals (UEs) for use in the 5G system may be equipped with multiple receiver chains (sets of RF circuitry) to enable them to communicate using more than one frequency span. Each system bandwidth/frequency span is associated with a centre frequency (also referred to as &#x201c;spectrum location&#x201d;). For example one operator may be assigned a band with 200 MHz bandwidth from 1.9 GHz to 2.1 GHz, the centre frequency being 2 GHz in which case the &#x201c;spectrum location&#x201d; is 2 GHz. On the other hand, if an operator has a band with 200 MHz bandwidth from 5.9 GHz to 6.1 GHz, then the &#x201c;spectrum location&#x201d; is 6 GHz. Although in LTE the centre frequency of the system bandwidth/frequency span is typically considered to be the carrier frequency, this is not necessarily the case in 5G systems.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">The new system should also be designed to be robust against phase noise, which is larger in higher frequency bands. One solution to this issue is to scale the OFDM configuration including the subcarrier spacing, thus defining a set of numerologies to exploit the various frequency bands optimally. An example of such a set of numerologies is shown in Table 2 below:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Proposed Numerologies for 5G</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OFDM parameter</entry><entry>Up to 6 GHz</entry><entry>Up to 20 GHz</entry><entry>Up to 40 GHz</entry><entry>Above 40 GHz</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Subcarrier spacing</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>kHz</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>kHz</entry><entry>60</entry><entry>kHz</entry><entry>2<sup>L </sup>&#xd7; 60</entry><entry>KHz</entry></row><row><entry>Clock frequency</entry><entry>61.44</entry><entry>MHz</entry><entry>122.88</entry><entry>MHz</entry><entry>245.76</entry><entry>MHz</entry><entry>2<sup>L </sup>&#xd7; 245.76</entry><entry>MHz</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Samples per OFDM</entry><entry>4096</entry><entry>4096</entry><entry>4096</entry><entry>4096</entry></row><row><entry>symbol</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>OFDM symbol</entry><entry>66.77</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>33.33</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>16.67</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>16.67/2<sup>L</sup></entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry></row><row><entry>duration</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>CP samples</entry><entry>&#x2002;288</entry><entry>&#x2002;288</entry><entry>&#x2002;288</entry><entry>&#x2002;288</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="9"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="28pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>CP duration</entry><entry>4.69</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>2.35</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>1.17</entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry><entry>1.17/2<sup>L</sup></entry><entry>&#x3bc;s</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="9" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">In the final column of Table 2, the column &#x201c;Up to 6 GHz&#x201d; corresponds to the existing LTE numerology. In this scheme, each numerology has its particular subcarrier spacing and corresponding OFDM symbol duration. The 15 kHz subcarrier spacing as employed in LTE used as the baseline subcarrier spacing and other possible subcarrier spacings can be obtained as multiples of the 15 kHz value. Incidentally, in the column &#x201c;Above 40 GHz&#x201d;, L is an integer allowing for the possibility of much wider subcarrier spacings. However, the above is only an example and many variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">When considering frequency spans and channel sizes in a wireless communication system, the concept of a &#x201c;channel raster&#x201d; (also called &#x201c;carrier raster&#x201d; or &#x201c;frequency raster&#x201d;) is important. In general, a &#x201c;raster&#x201d; is a step size applied to the possible location of any signal or channel. For systems such as GSM, UMTS and LTE, a channel raster means a set of locations in the frequency domain, typically equally spaced, where the carrier centre frequency can be located. The above mentioned cell search and synchronization procedure involves a terminal receiver scanning a frequency range to detect carrier frequencies at which synchronization signals are transmitted, under the assumption that synchronisation signals are transmitted at the carrier centre frequency. Thus, the distance between two consecutive places in a channel raster can be assumed as a step size when a terminal tries to search for the carrier frequency.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">Unlike many previous systems, in 5G, however, it is not necessarily the case that the synchronization signals are located at the centre frequency of the carrier. More generally, the channel raster can be defined as a set of places in the frequency domain and within a frequency span at which a carrier can be found by a terminal, but such a place may or may not be the carrier centre frequency. Furthermore the current understanding of &#x201c;carrier frequency&#x201d; may not be directly applicable in 5G/NR, so alternative terminology such as &#x201c;frequency span&#x201d; may be preferable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">With the introduction of extremely high frequencies, wider bandwidths and multiple numerologies for 5G usage in future, 5G physical design will be noticeably different compared with LTE design. Consequently there is a need to devise an initial cell search and synchronization procedure suitable for 5G, and to provide suitable mechanisms for the design of synchronization signals and broadcast signals.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0030">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a cell search and synchronization method in a wireless communication system providing at least one cell having a frequency span in the frequency domain, the method comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0031">defining, for a said cell, a plurality of resources within the frequency span and within a defined time frame for transmitting a synchronization signal wherein a resource is characterised by a location in the frequency domain and a location in the time domain; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0032">transmitting the synchronization signal in more than one of the plurality of resources.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">The above &#x201c;synchronization signal&#x201d; may be a primary synchronization signal, and/or it may be a secondary synchronization signal.

For example, if we consider a two-step synchronization procedure, then one solution is to broadcast both PSS and SSS, as in the current LTE synchronization procedure. Considering the aforementioned spectrum allocation for 5G and compared with the spectrum usage situation of LTE, the following items should be considered when determine whether to reuse the LTE synchronization procedure or design a new synchronization procedure for 5G system.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0092">Firstly, as already mentioned the bandwidth of 5G could be much larger compared with the design target of 20 MHz transmission bandwidth of LTE. Without any help from some prior information the receiver would potentially need to check all possible carrier frequencies on the channel raster. In general, the number of possible frequency raster locations in a given frequency span (supporting a few carriers) will be proportional to the transmission bandwidth multiplied by number of possible carriers, divided by the raster value. For 5 carriers in LTE this number could be something like 5&#xd7;20/0.1=1000. Assuming a total bandwidth in 5G/NR of some multiple of 100 MHz this number could be much higher (e.g. 10&#xd7;100/0.1=10000 assuming 10 carriers), and the implementation complexity and the tuning time when searching the whole bandwidth will be significantly increased compared with LTE using a 100 kHz channel raster. In addition, the introduction of NR/5G is likely to increase the number of possible frequency spans which should be searched for synchronization sequences.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0093">Secondly, the carrier frequency of 5G/NR could be much higher compared with the LTE carrier frequency. The path loss when using these higher carrier frequencies is increased, which will limit/reduce the size of a cell. Smaller cells imply fewer users per cell, and with a larger bandwidth it will be possible to use more resources in the frequency domain to accommodate the synchronization signals (e.g. by use of different frequencies), which will make it possible to reduce the interference between synchronization signals from different cells.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0094">Thirdly, different bandwidths (in the form of carriers or CCs) may be available to a terminal. For example a carrier with a typical bandwidth 10 MHz as in 4G/LTE would be expected to use the current defined raster value 100 kHz, whereas a 5G/NR carrier with an extremely large bandwidth can have a large raster value to keep a reasonably small number of possible carrier locations. The terminal (henceforth referred to as a UE) may determine the appropriate raster in different ways, such as:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0095">Prior knowledge of the raster to be assumed for a particular frequency span (or part of a frequency span) e.g. defined in specification or pre-stored (e.g. on a SIM card).</li>        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0096">Signalling (via a carrier on a different frequency) indicating the raster to be applied</li>        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0097">Blind detection: Making an initial search with a coarse raster and if this fails making a subsequent search with a fine raster</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0075" num="0098">It is also possible that both a large raster channel value and a traditional small channel raster value can be employed for the 5G carrier at the same time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the horizontal direction is a frequency axis, and the vertical arrows represent signals transmitted at particular frequencies. The upper part of the Figure shows the raster pattern <b>50</b> for a 4G carrier (Band B<b>1</b>) with relatively fine raster locations <b>51</b> at fixed 100 kHz intervals. Indicated at <b>100</b> is a raster pattern <b>100</b> for a 5G carrier (Band B<b>2</b>) consists of a coarse raster indicated by the solid arrows <b>101</b>, with some additional possible carrier locations with a fine raster around the coarse locations (as shown by the dashed arrows <b>102</b>). In other words, two raster spacings may be employed simultaneously in the same frequency span. This allows for some fine adjustment without too many different possible frequencies to search.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0099">The system information design in LTE can be viewed as a tiered system by jointly considering the importance of the information, the sequence of the information (logically information A should be obtained before acquiring information B) and the corresponding transmission overhead. In LTE some crucial information is included into the Master Information Block (MIB) and broadcasted by the BS (called eNB in LTE) through PBCH (LTE Physical Broadcast Channel), using the 6 RBs (Resource Block) in the middle of the system bandwidth where PSS and SSS are also located. In LTE the system bandwidth has only a few possible settings with a range from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz but a terminal has to support all possible settings, i.e., any particular setting deployed by the system. By broadcasting PBCH, PSS and SSS in the middle of the system bandwidth, a terminal will always be able to find synchronization signals and MIB no matter what the system bandwidth is, i.e., the detection of synchronization signal and MIB is independent of bandwidth. The synchronization signal and MIB design implies the following relationship between them: within the system bandwidth there is one and only one frequency domain location where PSS exists; one PSS is accompanied by one SSS signal in the same location in the frequency domain. The location of the MIB in the frequency domain is bounded by the 6 RBs in the middle of the system bandwidth which is indicated by the PSS.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0100">A 5G/NR system has many different properties compared with those of LTE, for example as mentioned before, a huge chunk of spectrum may be allocated for the NR system bandwidth (or equivalent) and the bandwidth supported by a particular terminal could be smaller than the corresponding system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0101">As well as providing signals for cell detection in 5G/NR, the PSS/SSS may also act as reference signals for demodulation of PBCH and/or act as reference signals for measurements used in Radio Resource Management (RRM). RRM measurements such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) or Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) may be made by the UE and used as a basis for cell selection and/or reported to the network to enable the appropriated handovers to new cells.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0102">Considering these new challenges it is desirable to have new design of synchronization signals and MIB transmission for NR. The specific problem addressed here is the design of PSS/SSS to simultaneously support the following:<ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0020" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0103">Cell detection and identification by UEs with limited bandwidth capability</li>        <li id="ul0020-0002" num="0104">RRM measurements over a wide bandwidth by UEs capable of wideband operation. This would include UEs where wideband capability is provided by parallel operation multiple receiver chains, each of limited bandwidth capability.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0080" num="0105">The principle in embodiments is outlined in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It is assumed that one cell will employ one frequency span for both its uplink and downlink communications with terminals. It is further assumed that a terminal wishes to synchronize with a cell provided by an operator in a particular frequency span. A default numerology will be associated with the frequency span, for example as shown in Table 2 above. In step S<b>100</b>, a channel raster value used by the cell will be determined by the numerology. As already mentioned, a channel raster is a set of locations in the frequency domain where a signal or channel (or more precisely a carrier wave thereof) can be located, and the term &#x201c;channel raster value&#x201d; denotes the step size or spacing between these frequency locations.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0106">In step S<b>102</b> possible resources for PSS/SSS/PBCH are defined. For example these may comprise all the raster locations across the frequency span as defined by the channel raster value. If a subset of the available raster locations is used, these should preferably be distributed over the whole frequency span for facilitating measurements (see below). Such locations will normally be predefined as part of the system implementation, but may be varied from time to time and instructed by higher-level signalling to a base station or equivalent such as a so-called gNB (next generation NodeB), which controls a Transmission/Reception Point (TRP) providing the cell. Step <b>104</b> is performed at the cell (base station) level and involves determining how many of the possible resources to use for actual transmission of PSS/SSS/PBCH, in other words how many instances of each of PSS, SSS and PBCH are required. In other words the number of transmissions within a predetermined time period (such as a frame) is determined, and factors to be considered in this determination relate to the deployment scenario, including the presence of neighbouring cells possibly causing interference, number and range of terminals etc. In addition to the number of instances, the actual locations are also determined. Regarding the possible resources in the frequency domain as a list arranged in order of frequency, if M PSS are required then the first M locations may be chosen for example. In practice, two or three instances in the frequency domain may be sufficient. If a gNB wishes to add an instance it may simply use the next available resource in the list. The respective number of instances of each of PSS, SSS and PBCH may differ as explained below. At a minimum, the operator merely needs to ensure that at least one PSS/SSS/PBCH is transmitted within the whole frequency span.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0107">Then in step S<b>106</b> the cell transmits PSS/SSS/PBCH in a number of instances, and in the resources previously determined. In step S<b>108</b> a terminal performs scanning by searching for a synchronization sequence in locations corresponding to the channel raster value, in a manner corresponding to the known use of PSS/SSS outlined in the introduction. The terminal may be configured in advance with the channel raster value and the synchronization signals to search for. By detecting one or more of the PSS/SSS/PBCH transmissions, the terminal becomes synchronized to the cell. Then the flow returns to step S<b>104</b> allowing the process to be repeated for a next time period, such as a frame or multiple frames. Thus the gNB will again transmit PSS/SSS/PBCH in a subsequent time frame, possibly in a different number of instances following a fresh determination of the numbers of transmissions required, allowing other terminals to synchronize with the cell.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0108">Note that signals such as PSS/SSS/PBCH are not necessarily transmitted at the same locations in the time domain (i.e. not necessarily simultaneously), and the resource used may have flexible or pre-determined time domain locations within a suitable time frame such as slot, subframe or radio frame.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0109">Embodiments will now be described with reference to embodiments based on a 5G/NR system which is assumed to share many characteristics with LTE.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0110">The following embodiments involve transmission of multiple PSS within the system bandwidth of a cell (also referred to here as a &#x201c;frequency span&#x201d;, since the concept of system bandwidth in LTE may be modified for use in NR).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0111">A first embodiment has PSS transmissions for a cell in multiple locations within the frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0112">The PSS transmissions are not necessarily uniformly spaced in the frequency domain. The possible frequency domain locations of PSS would be indicated by a channel raster whose value may depend on the frequency span (system bandwidth) or the spectrum location or both. It may be possible to have multiple channel raster values within one frequency span and it is also possible that these PSS locations in the frequency domain are indicated by channel raster with different step values. Incidentally, multiple channel raster values could be used by one cell, allowing a UE to perform a quick search (using larger channel raster) during its initial search and then perform a refined search (maybe based on the information obtained through the first search); this can reduce the complexity and speed up the initial search process.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0113">For simplicity, multiple possible PSS locations can be according to a channel raster with a uniform step value within a particular frequency range/span. One example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> where multiple PSS are transmitted at locations <b>111</b> indicated by one particular channel raster within a frequency range. The upward arrows show the possible locations of PSS with the third and fifth possible locations <b>112</b> unused in this example.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the same idea with resource allocations for the respective PSS in time and frequency domains, where PSS is transmitted at each of locations <b>111</b>, and possible locations <b>112</b> are not selected in this example. In this first embodiment, instances of SSS and PBCH corresponding to each PSS are also transmitted at the same frequencies; thus, the same numbers of PSS/SSS/PBCH are transmitted. It should be noted that in this and other figures the shaded rectangles representing PSS, SSS and PBCH respectively are schematic and do not necessarily represent the size of resource needed to transmit each signal or channel. However, it will significantly reduce the blind detection burden of a UE if all PSS/SSS have the same amount of time/frequency resource. Similarly the gaps shown between PSS/SSS/PBCH do not necessarily represent the size of any time domain offset between these signals. Such a time offset could also be zero (e.g. one or more of PSS/SSS/PBCH could be transmitted simultaneously). In this case one or more of the signals could share the same resource or be transmitted at different frequency domain raster locations, or with a pre-determined frequency offset from a raster location.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0115">The different PSS/SSS/PBCH instances can be received by UEs with different bandwidth capabilities as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Unlike in LTE, in 5G/NR a terminal is not mandated to support all available system bandwidths.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0116">For example, UE<b>1</b> with wideband capability as indicated at <b>121</b> can receive multiple instances of PSS/SSS/PBCH simultaneously, transmitted at both frequency domain locations <b>111</b>, while UE<b>3</b> having a narrower receiving capability indicated by <b>123</b> can only receive one instance at a time. UE<b>2</b> is shown operating at a frequency range <b>122</b> where there is no PSS/SSS/PBCH, only an unselected location <b>112</b>. UE<b>2</b> would need to be retuned to one or other of locations <b>111</b> in order to receive either instance of PSS/SSS/PBCH actually transmitted.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0117">One possible feature in NR is to allow a UE to operate in a wide bandwidth by using two or more receiver chains with narrow bandwidth, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The wide bandwidth is indicated at <b>124</b> and allows the UE to detect both instances of PSS/SSS/PBCH at frequency domain locations <b>111</b>. As indicated in the Figure, the wide bandwidth is provided by twin receiver chains in adjacent narrow bandwidths. Such a mode of operation might lead to a discontinuity in the transmission path in the region of transition from one receiver chain to the other, e.g. if the two receiver chains have different phase and/or amplitude characteristics. Tracking any phase or amplitude differences would be facilitated by transmission of suitable reference signals in the frequency ranges covered by each receiver chain. PSS/SSS could act as reference signals for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0118">In more detail, advantages of multiple PSS and/or SSS and/or PBCH transmissions include the following.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0119">(i) Reduced Cell Search Duration</p><p id="p-0095" num="0120">Two scenarios are proposed: the first scenario is that a terminal has some pre-configured cell search information about where to find synchronization signals during the initial access process. Under this scenario the gain on cell search time reduction is limited. The second scenario is that a terminal does not have or does not have proper pre-configured cell search information. Under this scenario the cell search time could be significantly reduced by introducing multiple PSS. For example if a terminal searches a particular frequency range from one end of this frequency range to the other end, having multiple PSS over the whole frequency range may significantly reduce the search time, especially when PSSs are transmitted near the upper and lower bounds of this frequency range.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0121">(ii) Frequency Diversity</p><p id="p-0097" num="0122">Multiple PSS/SSS/PBCH transmissions in different regions over the operating bandwidth will allow frequency diversity gain (improving the chances of receiving PSS/SSS/PBCH at one or other frequency). This could improve the probability of correct cell identification based on PSS/SSS, and the reliability of reception of PBCH. However, the UE would ideally need to know the frequency domain locations of the different transmissions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0123">(iii) Better Support for with UEs Having Different Capabilities</p><p id="p-0099" num="0124">In NR a terminal may not support the whole operating bandwidth. However the NR specification is unlikely to mandate a terminal to use a particular frequency range within the system bandwidth. Hence a terminal with limited bandwidth capability could have a choice of more than one part of the spectrum and still receive PSS/SSS/PBCH, such as UE<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A terminal might use a frequency range where no PSS (or SSS and PBCH) is transmitted in this frequency range (such as UE<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>); this terminal may need to frequently retune to another frequency region in order to detect synchronization signals or PBCH (before typically retuning again back to its original frequency). The RF retune may require a terminal to create a gap on transmission/reception, therefore reducing its throughput performance. Alternatively it is possible to ensure that the supporting bandwidth of a terminal always includes the frequency domain location where PSS/SSS/PBCH is transmitted. However this means the system loading, and hence associated interference between cells, may concentrate on the frequency regions around the place where PSS/SSS/PBCH is transmitted. With the introduction of multiple PSS (PSS/SSS/PBCH) transmission, the aforementioned issue will be eased.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, illustrates the above point. As illustrated by the rectangles <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, the resources in which PSS/SSS are not transmitted can be used to transmit data. UE<b>1</b> having a wide receiving bandwidth <b>121</b> can receive some data and PSS/SSS at the same time. UE<b>2</b>'s limited receiving bandwidth <b>122</b> is shown as tuned to data region <b>131</b>; if it is retuned to get PSS/SSS, will not obtain data transmitted in region <b>131</b>, on the other hand in the region of the nearby PSS/SSS there will not be any data scheduled to UE<b>2</b>. Thus retuning to obtain PSS/SSS/PBCH followed by tuning back to the original frequency will be required.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0126">(iv) Improved RRM Measurements.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0127">After a UE has connected to the network, it may continue to detect PSS/SSS for the purpose of measurements, treating PSS/SSS as reference signals. In the case that PSS/SSS are used for RRM measurements, multiple PSS/SSS will enable UEs to make corresponding RRM measurements reflecting the channel characteristics over a wider bandwidth than conventional PSS/SSS. The same benefit could apply for other signals used for RRM measurements (e.g. DeModulation Reference Signals, DMRS of PBCH). In NR there may be a special DMRS signal mainly used for PBCH detection. Therefore if PBCH are transmitted at different frequency location, there are more PBCH DMRS to be used for RRM purposes.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0128">In one variation of the first embodiment, each PBCH contains identical information, but the other characteristics of the PBCH could be different, such as different scrambling codes which would enable the respective PBCH to carry different information.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0129">Thus, in a further variation of the first embodiment, each PBCH may contain different information, for example a list or other indication of the existence of locations of the additional PSS/SSS/PBCH in the same frequency span (for simplicity, the list of locations could include that of the transmitting PBCH itself).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0130">In other embodiments based on the first embodiment the relationship (mapping) between PSS and/or SSS and/or PBCH is not restricted to a one-to-one mapping format (as applies in LTE), allowing more flexibility such as many-to-one or one-to-many mappings.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0131">With multiple PSS transmission, we can further extend the mapping between PSS and SSS. In general the mapping between the PSS and SSS over a particular frequency range/span can be that M PSS are mapped to N SSS where M&#x2265;1 and N&#x2265;1; M can either &#x2265;N or &#x2264;N. The mapping relationship can be by Frequency-Division Multiplexing, FDM, Time-Division Multiplexing, TDM or both FDM and TDM applied simultaneously. Similarly, mappings between SSS and PBCH can be devised.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0132">In a second embodiment based on the first embodiment we consider the case where one SSS corresponds to each PSS, but multiple SSS are mapped to one PBCH, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In this case we can distinguish between a location <b>111</b><i>a </i>at which all of PSS/SSS/PBCH are transmitted, and locations <b>111</b><i>b </i>and <b>111</b><i>c </i>where PSS/SSS (but not PBCH) are transmitted. This has the advantage that PBCH transmission uses less overhead, and generates less interference to other cells than in the first embodiment, but RRM measurements based on PSS/SSS can still be carried out over a wide bandwidth. During cell search a UE might identify the presence of PSS/SSS without a corresponding PBCH. The UE may then assume that the PBCH is located at some other frequency.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0133">In a variation of the second embodiment, the PBCH may be located at a frequency (on a raster) which does not have a corresponding PSS and/or SSS transmission. This could be one of the unused locations <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, but need not be (in other words, PBCH could be on another raster from that shown by the arrows).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0134">A third embodiment based on the second embodiment considers the case where multiple PSS mapped to one SSS and one PBCH, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In this case, all of PSS/SSS/PBCH are transmitted at frequency location <b>111</b><i>a</i>, whilst only PSS is transmitted at each of locations <b>111</b><i>b </i>and <b>111</b><i>c</i>. This further reduces the overhead compared with the second embodiment, due to less resource used for transmission of SSS. However, wide band RRM measurements would need to rely on PSS (or some other signal) rather than on SSS, since SSS is only transmitted in one location in this example. Thus, measurement based on PSS is more likely to reflect the real radio conditions on a wide frequency range.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0135">In a fourth embodiment, which is based on the first embodiment, the number of transmissions (instances) of any of PSS/SSS/PBCH can be changed with time, based on gNB configuration, providing that at any time instance, for the cell to be detectable, at least there should always be one PSS/SSS/PBCH being transmitted. This flexibility will allow the gNB to get a better tradeoff between synchronization signal overhead (and corresponding interference to other cells) and the system performance. For example, if cell acquisition by cell search is not a high priority and there are no UEs served by the cell with wideband capability, a single PSS/SSS/PBCH could be sufficient.

The method comprising setting a numerology for the system in dependence on factors such as the frequency band, and the frequency span, which further determine a channel raster used in the cell; defining, using the channel raster, a plurality of possible locations distributed across the frequency span for transmitting PSS/SSS/PBCH; determining how many instances of PSS, SSS and PBCH are required in the current time period; transmitting the number of instances of PSS, SSS and PBCH thus determined; and a terminal detecting one or more instance of PSS/SSS/PBCH in order to connect with the cell. Multiple transmissions of PSS/SSS/PBCH allow a terminal to detect these signals more easily, and facilitate use of PSS or SSS as reference signs for RRM purposes. Different numbers of PSS/SSS/PBCH may be transmitted with respective mappings between them, and the numbers of transmissions may vary over time. Multiple PSS/SSS/PBCH transmissions over the operating bandwidth are provided. In addition various possible mappings between PSS and SSS, and between SSS and PBCH are proposed, which may change with time.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0140">Various modifications are possible within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0141">With respect to the &#x201c;mapping&#x201d; between PSS and SSS referred to above, the Figures show cases where there are more PSS than SSS. The reverse is also possible, i.e. fewer PSS than SSS. Thus, although the above embodiments involve transmission of multiple PSS within the system bandwidth of a cell, this is not necessarily essential to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0142">The mapping does not necessarily involve transmitting all of PSS/SSS/PBCH at the same frequency locations. As mentioned, the mappings may involve FDM, therefore, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, for example PBCH could be transmitted at a different frequency location from PSS/SSS.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0143">In some proposals for 5G, a cell is provided by a &#x201c;beam&#x201d; which is one of multiple beams provided from a transmission/reception point via digital beamforming. Since the present disclosure focuses on the time/frequency domain and beams are in the spatial domain, the present disclosure can also be applied to such multiple beams. A simple extension is to apply the measures taken in the time/frequency domain in any of the above embodiments, to each spatial domain (beam). Broadcasting of PSS/SSS/PBCH as referred to above includes transmitting them on any one or more of such beams, including swept beams. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; is therefore to be interpreted broadly and includes parts of a cell, a beam, and the coverage area of an access point, transmission point or other network node.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0144">The disclosure is equally applicable to FDD and TDD systems, and to mixed TDD/FDD implementations (i.e., not restricted to cells of the same FDD/TDD type).
