Lower doses of medication can be used with site specific administration and systemic toxicities of drug therapies can be mitigated. Furthermore, delivery port implantable devices are used regularly in the delivery of chemotherapy and medications to allow direct administration of certain medications best administered through direct access to the venous system, central nervous system and peritoneal cavity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some organs of the body, direct administration of certain drugs may be required to achieve therapeutic doses of medication without inducing serious toxicity. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from potentially toxic substances, but also restricts the passage of most drug molecules. Because of the BBB, direct administration of drugs may be required to achieve therapeutic concentrations for the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, devices for local, repeatable, and chronic drug delivery can be used. These devices contain catheters that distribute drug to specific tissues and may or may not contain a reservoir for storing drug. These devices include implantable drug pump systems, for example, Ommaya Rickham reservoirs and Port-A-Cath&#xae; devices. These devices deliver either a bolus or slow infusion of drugs to specific regions of the body. The types of drugs that can be used range from pain medications (e.g., morphine) to chemotherapeutics (e.g., methotrexate, cytarabine).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless, body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. CSF is produced in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125 mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500 mL is generated every day. CSF acts, in part, as a cushion for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Chronic administration of small molecule medications to the brain CSF is unexplored especially medications with short half-lives. The only two molecules that have ever been looked at chronically are morphine and baclofen which have barely been explored but have been used because they already have been used in CSF administration in the spine. Baclofen's half-life is on the order of five hours and morphine's half-life is on the order of two hours.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Acute administration has been looked at primarily in the form of short term boluses and primarily for treatment of leptomeningeal disease. In fact, it has been decided that chronic administration of drugs into the CSF will not work for brain disease other than for leptomeningeal disease which is not within the brain itself</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">CSF flow is typically thought to go from the brain to one lateral ventricle, to the third ventricle and fourth and out over and under the brain convexities before being reabsorbed. In addition, animals have vastly different size and scale to their brains and they unexplored relative to other bodily organs and systems. The animals used in most testing of CSF flow is rats who have a 111000 the size of the human brain and even primates have a brain which is at best 1/10th the size of the human brain for large experimental primates. Furthermore, clinical results are expected to be different in human subjects than in animals. As a result of these and other factors allometric scaling is expected to be vastly off Allometric equations take the general form Y=aM h, where Y is some biological variable, M is a measure of body size, and b is some scaling exponent. In allometry, equations are often presented in logarithmic form so that a diverse range of body sizes can be plotted on a single graph.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be desirable, therefore, to determine a method, system, composition, and/or protocol resulting in the successful chronic administration of medications with short half-lives directly to the brain.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Highly concentrated solutions are disclosed along with methods of inhibiting and/or ameliorating functional neurological disorders of the brain. The method may include administering directly to a brain of a subject a medicament multiple times over a time period of 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7 days or more. The medicament may include a half-life of less than one day, 16 hours, 8 hours, 4 hours or 2 hours in the cerebrospinal fluid. The method may include inhibiting and/or ameliorating a functional neurological disorder of the brain using the medicament.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the medicament may include valproic acid or pharmaceutically active derivatives thereof. In some embodiments, the medicament comprises a half-life of less than about 30 minutes in the cerebrospinal fluid. In some embodiments, during treatment the medicament is continuously delivered in an amount so as to maintain a concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid of between 1 to 500 micrograms/ml, or 5 to 200 micrograms/ml or 50 micrograms/ml&#xb1;20%, &#xb1;10%, &#xb1;5% over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days.

Typically, medicants used for treating diseases of the rain, especially functional neurological disorder, have relatively long half-lives on the order of two hours or longer, and except for morphine, typically much longer than two hours. The reasons medicants with long half-lives are used is obvious and due at least in part to the fact that it is difficult to achieve therapeutic levels of a medicant in a subject if the medicant is decomposing too quickly. This can be especially problematic due to the manner in which medicants are typically administered in a general matter (e.g., orally, intravenously, etc.) to a subject as opposed to a specific regional administration (e.g., topically to a regional skin condition. When medicants are administered generally (e.g., orally in order to treat a specific region of the body not orally associated) they can take time to diffuse through the subject's body and accumulate in appreciable levels in the specific region requiring medicants with a substantial half-life.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, a chemical composition and/or method may include inhibiting and/or ameliorating functional neurological disorders of the brain.

The disorder may lead to the subject experiencing neurological symptoms such as weakness, movement disorders, sensory symptoms, seizures, and blackouts.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The method may include administering one or more medicants directly to a brain of a subject. A medicant may be administered chronically. Generally chronic administration may include any medicant paradigm where the medicant is given during more than one experimental session. However, it should be noted that each experimental session may involve multiple doses or drug doses and behavioral paradigms. Typically, a paradigm may be considered chronic if it was repeated over many days for a subject Chronic administration may include multiple times over a time period of at least two days. In contrast acute administration of a medicant may be generally defined as a drug administration paradigm where a drug is given during one experimental session (once during the experiment, or multiple times) within a 24-hour period.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Chronic administration may include continuous administration of a medicant during a treatment period. In some embodiments, administering directly to a subject's brain may include substantially continuous administration of the medicant during treatment.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, administering directly to a subject's brain may include administering multiple bolus pulses of the medicant during treatment. Bolus pulses in general may be described as the administration of a medicant in a single, large dose which might be repeated after an interval of days. Thought to have the advantage of high tissue levels and fewer of the undesirable side-effects associated with more frequent dosing. In some embodiments, herein bolus pulses may be considered as the administration of a medicant multiple times wherein the time between administration is greater than a half-life of the medicant. A dosage may be based upon a target treatment dosage of the medicant and the medicant's half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid such that the target treatment dosage during a treatment period is multiplied by a number of half-lives lost occurring during the gaps in the treatment period to achieve a meaningful target therapeutic levels.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, a dosage is based upon a desired daily dosage of the medicant and the medicant's half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid.

If continuous or substantially continuous administration is used to deliver a medicant then a concentration of at least 10 micrograms/mL is maintained in the cerebrospinal fluid during a treatment period.

Like any weak acid, the valproate molecule will be charged above its pKa value (4.8), and thus more readily soluble at high pH. Despite its charged character at high pH, solubility limits in water are commonly reported as 50-100 mg/mL. Indeed, this is quite concentrated for any solute, with 100 mg/mL equivalent to a 10% solution. Given the reported solubility limit, it was unexpected when experiments demonstrated that sodium valproate fully dissolves and forms clear, homogeneous aqueous solutions up to at least 500 mg/mL. In some embodiments, sodium valproate may have a concentration of greater than 200 mg/mL, greater than 300 mg/mL, or greater than 400 mg/mL.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Given a pKa of 4.8, it would be expected based upon accepted generalizations that a concentrated solution of sodium valproate would have a pH within about 1 pH unit of the pKa. Therefore, a solution buffered by sodium valproate should resist pH changes between pH 3.8-5.8, with minimal buffering capacity (&#x3b2;) above pH 5.8. However, a solution of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate in water yields a pH of approximately 8.3. More concentrated solutions (&#x3e;350 mg/mL) possess pH values above 9. This unexpected finding indicates that sodium valproate is much more soluble than is commonly reported.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a graph pH titrations of different sodium valproate solutions (5 mL) by progressively adding 0.1 mL of 25 mM HCl. A typical buffer concentration is 10 mM, which is equivalent to 1.7 mg/mL sodium valproate: about 90-fold than embodiments depicted herein. If you look at the line depicting the titration of 10 mM sodium valproate (open squares in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), one can see that the pH changes from 6.6 to 4.36 as 1 mL of acid is added in 0.1 mL increments. The pH of this solution hits the pKa after 0.6 mL of 25 mM HCl is added; this is the point of maximum buffering capacity. Although it is difficult to clearly discern by eye, the pH change (4.81 to 4.74) is minimized as an additional 0.1 mL acid is added (i.e., going from 0.6 mL to 0.7 mL as compared to any other addition of 0.1 mL acid). This is the experimental illustration of the maximum buffer capacity that can be calculated from the Van Slyke buffer equation:</p><p id="p-0079" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mn>2.3</mn>   <mi>C</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>K</mi>      <mi>a</mi>     </msub>     <mo>[</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>H</mi>       <mn>3</mn>      </msub>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msup>       <mi>O</mi>       <mo>+</mo>      </msup>     </mrow>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>    <msup>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>K</mi>        <mi>a</mi>       </msub>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <mo>[</mo>        <mrow>         <msub>          <mi>H</mi>          <mn>3</mn>         </msub>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <msup>          <mi>O</mi>          <mo>+</mo>         </msup>        </mrow>        <mo>]</mo>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mn>2</mn>    </msup>   </mfrac>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">When calculated the maximum buffer capacity of 10 mM sodium valproate (i.e., at pH=pKa=4.8), one gets a value of 5.75&#xd7;10-3. For comparison, blood has a buffer capacity of 3.9&#xd7;10-2. One can see from the graph depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> that the change in pH of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate is minimal, indicating that it acts like a buffer well above (&#x3e;3 pH units) its pKa. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates that the addition of 0.4% sodium citrate has virtually no effect on the buffer capacity of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate. If one looks at the last two points in the titration curve of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate, the pH changes from 7.34 to 7.30, indicating a very strong buffering capacity even though this is 2.5 pH units above the pKa of sodium valproate. According to the Van Slyke equation, the calculated (theoretical) buffer capacity of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate at pH 7.4 is roughly equivalent (&#x3b2;=5.19&#xd7;10-3) to that seen in the typical buffer (10 mM) at its maximum buffer capacity (pH=4.8). In short, this demonstrates that 150 mg/mL sodium valproate acts as a buffer at physiological pH (pH=7.4) that is equivalent in strength to the maximum buffer capacity achieved at a &#x201c;typical&#x201d; buffer concentration at pH 4.8, and this is consistent with the pH changes upon titration observed. This is unexpected in the sense that this strong buffer capacity is observed well outside of the range expected for a typical buffer solution with a pKa of 4.8. The fact that this is observed is consistent with the equation described above, so it could be argued that this behavior is predicted from basic theory. However, because this high concentration of buffer species is so different from normal buffer solutions it is unexpected, i.e., formulation scientists typically use the &#x201c;rule of thumb&#x201d; of &#xb1;1 pH unit from the pKa.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Concerns about potential precipitation during administration due to either reduced pH or contaminating metal ions prompted us to explore sodium citrate as both a buffering component and a chelator of metal ions. Because citrate has a pKa of 6.4, incorporation of citrate into sodium valproate solutions should fortify buffering in the physiological pH range. Citrate may chelate trace metal ions that may become solubilized/released within the pump. Considering the unexpectedly strong buffering by sodium valproate (described above), additional buffering capacity may not be necessary. Indeed, results with solutions of 150 mg/mL (0.9 M) sodium valproate with or without 0.4% sodium citrate (13.6 mM) indicate that this low level of citrate does not provide any measurable increase in buffering capacity above pH 7, nor does it significantly change the initial pH of these solutions. Nonetheless, inclusion of sodium citrate as a cation/metal chelator may provide an improved formulation. It is worth noting that citrate is naturally present in cerebral spinal fluid.

In the early experiments with the liquid form of valproic acid, it was found that the droplets of valproic acid were dissolving into the water, complicating the development of a stable emulsion (an emulsion is only possible if one phase is not soluble in the other phase). In the course of these experiments, it also became evident that the reported solubility limit of sodium valproate was grossly inaccurate, and we could dissolve very high concentrations in water; up to at least 500 mg/mL. Therefore, it was unnecessary to go through the work of developing a stable emulsion (in fact, this would be quite difficult considering its high solubility), and that high concentrations of the drug could be achieved as a solution. Accordingly, we opted to pursue a single phase solution of highly concentrated sodium valproate.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">On the Use of Citrate in ICV Formulations:</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Our initial formulations did not include citrate. When problems with the pump were reported, we assumed that the tubing was clogged, and therefore that some precipitation/aggregation had occurred. Knowing that the formulation was well below the solubility limit of sodium valproate (see above), we then hypothesized about what could be causing a precipitate to form. It is important to recognize that the potential for precipitation/aggregation is increased in very concentrated formulations like those we are developing. Also, it is well-known that metal ions can desorb from any metallic surface, and interact with molecules in solution. Typically, metal ions are desorbed as cationic species that are likely to interact with anionic molecules (e.g., valproic acid). In addition, metal ions can catalyze oxidation reactions (e.g., Fenton chemistry) that degrade the drug molecule into inactive species that may be more prone to precipitation/aggregation. For this reason, excipients that bind metal ions (i.e., chelators) are often used in pharmaceutical formulations to reduce the potential for physical (precipitation) and chemical (oxidation) degradation. In fact, Depacon (an IV-injectable solution of sodium valproate) contains EDTA, and we speculated that this might be added for its ability to chelate metals, thereby stabilizing the solution. In considering a chelator that would be suitable for ICV administration, we were concerned that EDTA would chelate calcium which could interfere with neuronal activity. In searching for other chelators that might be compatible with the brain, we learned that citrate was a natural component of CSF, and thus would be compatible with this route of administration.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In addition to metal-induced precipitation, the other possibility that occurred to us was a precipitation event due to changes in pH. We reasoned that a buffering agent that prevented pH changes would also be beneficial. Since it is advantageous to develop formulations at near physiological pH (well above the pKa of sodium valproate; 4.8), it would be desirable to include a buffer species possessing a higher Kasuch that it would prevent a decrease in pH. In this regard, citrate also served that function, and it has three pKa's (3.13, 4.76 and 6.40) that would allow it to perform a buffering function in addition to its role as a chelator. It was only later that we learned that sodium valproate was capable of buffering itself at much higher pH.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Sodium valproate is used clinically at concentrations of 100 mg/mL. Like any weak acid, the valproate molecule will be charged above its pKa value (4.8), and thus more readily soluble at high pH.

Furthermore, given a pKa of 4.8, it would be expected that a concentrated solution of sodium valproate would have a pH slightly above the pKa, perhaps even a whole pH unit above this value (&#x2248;5.5-6.0). However, a solution of 150 mg/mL sodium valproate in water yields a pH of approximately 8.3. More concentrated solutions (&#x3e;350 mg/mL) possess pH values above 9. This unexpected finding indicates that sodium valproate is much more soluble than is commonly reported.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In addition, the high pH of these solutions suggests that sodium valproate at high concentrations is capable of acting as a buffer well above its pKa.
