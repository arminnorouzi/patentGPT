description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Unbiased forward genetic screening approaches have been widely used for new cancer drug target discovery. To date, most screens have been limited to identifying cancer growth dependencies at the single-gene level. While significant, these screens only capture a small subset of potential targets, completely missing synthetic sick/lethal genetic interactions that arise only from the simultaneous perturbation of two or more genes. Combinatorial genetic screening, a high-throughput strategy to perturb multiple genes simultaneously, holds great promise for discovering therapeutically tractable synthetic sick/lethal interactions across diverse disease types, including cancers. Currently, Cas9-based methods are efficient in single-gene knockout screening, but underperform in combinatorial genetic screening, primarily due to the high recombination frequency and complicated cloning of the dual CRISPR-Cas9 RNA (sgRNA) expression vector. Cas12a (formerly Cpf1), an RNA-programmable DNA endonuclease similar to Cas9, has the potential to overcome these limitations. Unlike Cas9, Cas12a has the intrinsic RNase activity to process its own crRNA array, enabling multi-gene editing from a single RNA transcript.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a great need in the art for simple and robust CRISPR-based combinatorial genetic screening techniques in cancer cells.

Cleavage can be initiated by a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond. Both single-stranded cleavage and double-stranded cleavage are possible. Double-stranded cleavage can occur as a result of two distinct single-stranded cleavage events.

A skilled artisan will understand that any DNA, which comprises a nucleotide sequences or a partial nucleotide sequence encoding a protein that elicits an immune response therefore encodes an &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; as that term is used herein. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will understand that an antigen need not be encoded solely by a full length nucleotide sequence of a gene. It is readily apparent that the present invention includes, but is not limited to, the use of partial nucleotide sequences of more than one gene and that these nucleotide sequences are arranged in various combinations to elicit the desired immune response.

Thus, a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">As used herein &#x201c;endogenous&#x201d; refers to any material from or produced inside an organism, cell, tissue or system.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a small chemical molecule on an antigen that can elicit an immune response, inducing B and/or T cell responses.

The identity or extent to which two amino acid sequences have the same residues at the same positions in an alignment is often expressed as a percentage. The identity between two amino acid sequences is a direct function of the number of matching or identical positions; e.g., if half (e.g., five positions in a polymer ten amino acids in length) of the positions in two sequences are identical, the two sequences are 50% identical; if 90% of the positions (e.g., 9 of 10), are matched or identical, the two amino acids sequences are 90% identical.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0098">The term &#x201c;immune response&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a cellular response to an antigen that occurs when lymphocytes identify antigenic molecules as foreign and induce the formation of antibodies and/or activate lymphocytes to remove the antigen.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0099">The term &#x201c;immunosuppressive&#x201d; is used herein to refer to reducing overall immune response.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0100">&#x201c;Insertion/deletion&#x201d;, commonly abbreviated &#x201c;indel,&#x201d; is a type of genetic polymorphism in which a specific nucleotide sequence is present (insertion) or absent (deletion) in a genome.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0101">&#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; means altered or removed from the natural state.

Also provided are compositions comprising the modified CRISPR-Cas12a system of the present invention. The invention also includes methods comprising the modified CRISPR-Cas12a system of the invention for screening for synergistic combinations of drug targets, as well as the treatment of cancer in subjects in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">CRISPR-Based Gene Editing</heading><p id="p-0118" num="0124">CRISPR-Cas gene editing systems are classified into two classes (1 and 2) that are subdivided into six types (I through VI). Class 1 (types I, III and IV) systems rely on multiple Cas proteins to form a ribonucleoprotein complex called Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense). Though accounting for about 90% of naturally-occurring CRISPR systems in archaea and bacteria, the complexity of Class 1 systems have made them undesirable for adapting into genome-editing systems. Class 2 systems, on the other hand, (types II, V and VI) use a single Cas protein. Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems are naturally found almost exclusively in bacteria, and assemble a ribonucleoprotein complex, consisting of a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a Cas protein. The crRNA comprises sequences complementary to specific DNA sequences and acts to precisely guide the Cas nuclease to the target genomic sequined and short, adjacent genomic sequence called a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. Cas protein complexes are adapted for precise genome editing by providing a crRNA with a designed guide sequence which is complementary to the sequence of the targeted DNA. The most widely characterized CRISPR-Cas system is the type II subtype II-A that is found in <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(Sp), which uses the protein SpCas9, also called Cas9. Cas9 was the first Cas-protein engineered for use in gene editing. Class 2 type V CRISPR systems are further classified into 4 subtypes (V-A, V-B, V-C, V-U). V-A encodes the protein Cas12a (also known as Cpf1).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">CRISPR-Cas12a</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0125">As described herein, the discovery and characterization of the Class 2, type V CRISPR system, Cas12a/Cpf1 has enabled rapid genome editing of multiple loci in the same cell. Cas12a is a single component RNA-guided nuclease that can mediate target cleavage with a single crRNA, that is typically 42-44 nt in length, with the first 19/20 nt corresponding to the repeat sequence and the remaining 23-25 nt to the spacer sequence. While in type II CRISPR systems, such as Cas9-based systems, the maturation of crRNA requires host RNase III along with a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), which is base paired with the pre-crRNA. The Cas12a protein, however, has been shown to process its own pre-crRNA into mature crRNAs, without the requirement of a tracrRNA, making it a unique effector protein with both endoribonuclease and endonuclease activities. After the pre-crRNA has been transcribed during the expression stage, it is cleaved by the Cas12a protein 4 nucleotides upstream of the hairpin structures formed by the CRISPR repeats, producing intermediate crRNA molecules which undergo further processing into mature crRNAs.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0126">The Cas12a enzyme can be derived from any genera of microbes, including but not limited to, <i>Parcubacteria, Lachnospiraceae, Butyrivibrio, Peregrinibacteria, Acidaminococcus, Porphyromonas, Lachnospiraceae, Porphromonas, Prevotella, Moraxela, Smithella, Leptospira, Lachnospiraceae, Francisella, Candidatus</i>, and <i>Eubacterium</i>. In certain embodiments, Cas12a is derived from a species from the <i>Acidaminococcus </i>genus (AsCpf1).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0127">The Cas12a protein adopts a bilobed structure formed by the REC and Nuc lobes. The REC lobe is comprised of REC1 and REC2 domains, and the Nuc lobe is comprised of the RuvC, the PAM-interacting (PI) and the WED domains, and additionally, the bridge helix (BH). The RuvC endonuclease domain of this effector protein is made up of three discontinuous parts (RuvC I-III). The RNase site for processing its own crRNA is situated in the WED-III subdomain, and the DNase site is located in the interface between the RuvC and the Nuc domains. Only the 5&#x2032; repeat region of the crRNA is involved in the assembly of the Cas complex. The 19/20 nt repeat region forms a pseudoknot structure through intramolecular base pairing. The crRNA is stabilized through interactions with the WED, RuvC and REC2 domains of the endonuclease, as well as two hydrated Mg2+ ions. This binary interference complex is then responsible for recognizing and cleaving target DNA sequences.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0128">Cas12a-based CRISPR systems offer several differences from more traditional Cas9-based editing systems. Cas9 requires two RNA molecules: tracrRNA and a crRNA, whereas Cas12a requires only a single RNA molecule, the crRNA. Cas9 possesses two nuclease sites HNH and RuvC domains, while Cas12a possesses only one nuclease site in the RuvC domain. Additionally, Cas12a also possesses an RNA processing site. Additionally, there are distinct differences in the mechanisms employed by the two proteins when it comes to RNA processing, PAM recognition, target DNA binding and eventually catalysis. The single crRNA molecule of Cas12a systems simplifies and enables the process of targeting multiple genomic loci simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0129">In the context of formation of a CRISPR complex, &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; refers to a sequence to which a crRNA sequence is designed to have some complementarity, where hybridization between a target sequence and a crRNA sequence promotes the formation of a CRISPR complex. Full complementarity is not necessarily required, provided there is sufficient complementarity to cause hybridization and promote formation of a CRISPR complex. A target sequence may comprise any polynucleotide, such as DNA or RNA polynucleotides.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Modified CRISPR-Cas12a Systems</heading><p id="p-0124" num="0130">In certain embodiments, the Cas12a enzyme used in the invention is modified through specific mutations such that the function and efficiency of the enzyme is improved. There improvements can include, but are not limited to, increased DNA binding affinity, targeting range, on-target activities, fidelity, and decreased non-specific cellular toxicity (that is, toxicity not directly related to the targeted gene sequences) and the ability to target more genomic loci simultaneously as compared to unmodified systems and other modified systems known to the art. Previous studies have identified four mutations, which result in greater DNA-binding ability of the Cas enzyme resulting in more efficient gene editing activities on site with canonical and non-canonical PAMs relative to wildtype Cas12a. These mutations include S170R, E174R, S542R, and K548R (see Kleinstiver, et al. (2019) <i>Nat Biotechnol</i>. March; 37(3): 276-282.). Cas12a enzymes can be engineered to comprise one or all of these mutations, and the skilled artisan would recognize which mutations or combinations of mutations would be most beneficial to a particular application. In certain embodiments of the current invention, the Cas12a protein comprises an E174R mutation. In certain embodiments, the Cas12a protein comprises an S542R mutation. In certain embodiments, the Cas12a protein comprises both E174R and S542R mutations.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the modifications to the CRISPR-Cas12a system of the invention comprises a modified nuclear localization signal (NLS). These signals perform a key function by directing the CRISPR-Cas complex into the nucleus, wherein it is able to interact with genomic DNA. Previous studies known in the art have identified that altering the NLS of the Cas12a enzyme, typically by altering the number and position of NLS sequences, improves genome editing efficiency. (Liu, et al. (2019) <i>Nucleic Acids Res</i>. May 7; 47(8): 4169-4180) In particular, these studies found that engineered variants of Cas12a comprising two different nuclear localization sequences (NLS) on the C terminus demonstrated increased editing efficiency in mammalian cells. In certain embodiments of the current invention, the modification of the Cas12a involves the addition of six additional NLS sequences, which results in improved efficiency over wildtype NLS and engineered two NLS CRISPR-systems. In certain embodiments, when the six-NLS modification is combined with other modifications of the invention, the result is an optimal gene editing function.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0132">In certain embodiments, the modifications to the CRISPR-Cas12a system of the invention comprises a dual direct repeat (DR) guide RNA. In some embodiments, the pre-crRNAs comprise full-length direct repeat (full-DR-crRNA) sequences with specific stem-loop G-C base substitutions. These modifications result in increased editing efficiencies, including editing rate, as compared with the standard mature crRNA framework of unmodified CRISPR-Cas12a systems and have been noted in previously published studies (Liu, et al. (2019) <i>Nucleic Acids Res</i>. May 7; 47(8): 4169-4180). In certain embodiments, the modified crRNA comprises from 3&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; a first direct repeat (DR) sequence, a gRNA, and a second direct repeat sequence. In certain embodiments, the crRNA comprises from 3&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; a first direct repeat sequence, a first gRNA, a second direct repeat sequence, a second gRNA, and a third direct repeat sequence. In certain embodiments, any one of the direct repeats is about 19 nucleotides in length. The inclusion of two direct repeats, also called dual direct repeats, increases DNA editing efficiency as compared to single direct repeats or standard mature crRNA frameworks.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0133">In certain embodiments, the modifications to the CRISPR-Cas12a system of the invention comprises a combination of Cas12a enzyme mutations, a modified dual direct repeat guide RNA, and a modified nuclear localization signal comprising six repeated NLS sequences. In certain embodiments the Cas12a enzyme mutations comprise E174R and S542R mutations. While other modified CRISPR-Cas12a systems are known in the art, (see DeWeirdt, et al.

Methods of introducing nucleic acids into a cell include physical, biological and chemical methods. Physical methods for introducing a polynucleotide, such as RNA, into a host cell include calcium phosphate precipitation, lipofection, particle bombardment, microinjection, electroporation, and the like. RNA can be introduced into target cells using commercially available methods including electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector-II (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany)), (ECM 830 (BTX) (Harvard Instruments, Boston, Mass.) or the Gene Pulser II (BioRad, Denver, Colo.), Multiporator (Eppendort, Hamburg Germany). RNA can also be introduced into cells using cationic liposome mediated transfection using lipofection, using polymer encapsulation, using peptide mediated transfection, or using biolistic particle delivery systems such as &#x201c;gene guns&#x201d; (see, for example, Nishikawa, et al., Hum Gene Ther., 12(8):861-70 (2001).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0154">Biological methods for introducing a polynucleotide of interest into a host cell include use of DNA and RNA vectors. Viral vectors, and especially retroviral vectors, have become the most widely used method for inserting genes into mammalian, e.g., human cells. Other viral vectors can be derived from lentivirus, poxviruses, herpes simplex virus I, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and the like. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,350,674 and 5,585,362.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0155">Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. An exemplary colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (e.g., an artificial membrane vesicle).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0156">Lipids suitable for use can be obtained from commercial sources. For example, dimyristyl phosphatidylcholine (&#x201c;DMPC&#x201d;) can be obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.; dicetyl phosphate (&#x201c;DCP&#x201d;) can be obtained from K &#x26; K Laboratories (Plainview, N.Y.); cholesterol (&#x201c;Choi&#x201d;) can be obtained from Calbiochem-Behring; dimyristyl phosphatidylglycerol (&#x201c;DMPG&#x201d;) and other lipids may be obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.). Stock solutions of lipids in chloroform or chloroform/methanol can be stored at about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. Chloroform is used as the only solvent since it is more readily evaporated than methanol. &#x201c;Liposome&#x201d; is a generic term encompassing a variety of single and multilamellar lipid vehicles formed by the generation of enclosed lipid bilayers or aggregates. Liposomes can be characterized as having vesicular structures with a phospholipid bilayer membrane and an inner aqueous medium. Multilamellar liposomes have multiple lipid layers separated by aqueous medium. They form spontaneously when phospholipids are suspended in an excess of aqueous solution. The lipid components undergo self-rearrangement before the formation of closed structures and entrap water and dissolved solutes between the lipid bilayers (Ghosh et al., 1991 Glycobiology 5: 505-10). However, compositions that have different structures in solution than the normal vesicular structure are also encompassed. For example, the lipids may assume a micellar structure or merely exist as nonuniform aggregates of lipid molecules. Also contemplated are lipofectamine-nucleic acid complexes.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0157">Regardless of the method used to introduce exogenous nucleic acids into a host cell or otherwise expose a cell to the inhibitor of the present invention, in order to confirm the presence of the nucleic acids in the host cell, a variety of assays may be performed. Such assays include, for example, &#x201c;molecular biological&#x201d; assays well known to those of skill in the art, such as Southern and Northern blotting, RT-PCR and PCR; &#x201c;biochemical&#x201d; assays, such as detecting the presence or absence of a particular peptide, e.g., by immunological means (ELISAs and Western blots) or by assays described herein to identify agents falling within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0158">Moreover, the nucleic acids may be introduced by any means, such as transducing the cells, transfecting the cells, and electroporating the cells.

In certain embodiments, any number of cell lines available in the art, may be used. In certain embodiments, cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll separation. In one embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis or leukapheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations, for subsequent processing steps. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, Ca-free, Mg-free PBS. Alternatively, the undesirable components of the apheresis sample may be removed and the cells directly resuspended in culture media.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0161">Cells can also be frozen. While many freezing solutions and parameters are known in the art and will be useful in this context, in a non-limiting example, one method involves using PBS containing 20% DMSO and 8% human serum albumin, or other suitable cell freezing media.

To prepare whole cell lysates, 2&#xd7;106 cells were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% &#x3b2;-mercaptoethanol, and then denatured at 95&#xb0; C. for 10 min. The protein extracts were separated on a 4-15% TGX gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting. All primary antibodies used at 1:1000 dilutions: FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich Cat #F1804, RRID:AB_262044), Lamin-B1 (Abcam Cat #ab16048, RRID:AB_10107828), and &#x3b1;-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Cat #T6199, RRID:AB_477583). Secondary antibodies used: anti-Rabbit (LI-COR Biosciences Cat #925-32211, RRID:AB_2651127), anti-Mouse (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat #A-21058, RRID:AB_2535724). Blots were imaged on a Licor Odyssey. Relative abundance of protein was quantified via gel densitometry with ImageJ software. AsCas12a protein levels in the nuclear fraction were first normalized to Lamin-B1 levels and then to the corresponding 1&#xd7;NLS samples.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0178">Competition-based cellular proliferation assays.

The percentage of crRNA-positive (GFP-positive) cell population was monitored over time using the Guava Easycyte 10 HT instrument (Millipore).

The AsCas12a library gene list was adapted from a previously published SpCas9 pooled genetic screening against epigenetic regulators. Approximately five crRNAs were designed for each domain, though some domains contain fewer (&#x2265;3 crRNAs) due to limited TTTV PAM abundance. An oligonucleotide pool containing the crRNA sequences flanked by BsmbI recognition sites and 24-nt primer sites was synthesized (Twist Bioscience). The pool was amplified with Phusion Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase (NEB) over 20 cycles with an annealing temperature of 65&#xb0; C. The PCR product was gel-purified (Macherey-Nagel) and ligated into the BsmbI-digested pRG212 backbone using Golden Gate cloning. The ligation product was electroporated into MegaX DH10B electrocompetent cells (Invitrogen) with an ECM 630 Electroporation System (BTX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cloned crRNA library was cultured overnight at 30&#xb0; C. to minimize recombination, and the DNA was extracted with the PureLink HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Invitrogen).

Currently, Cas9-based methods are efficient in single-gene knockout screening but underperform in combinatorial genetic screening, primarily due to the high recombination frequency and complicated cloning of the dual CRISPR-Cas9 RNA (sgRNA) expression vector. Cas12a (formerly Cpf1), an RNA-programmable DNA endonuclease similar to Cas9, has the potential to overcome these limitations. Unlike Cas9, Cas12a has the intrinsic RNase activity to process its own crRNA array, enabling multi-gene editing from a single RNA transcript (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). However, the low gene editing efficiency of Cas12a in mammalian cells restricts its application in combinatorial genetic screening, with no reported Cas12a-based combinatorial negative-selection &#x2018;dropout&#x2019; screen.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0196">To optimize Cas12a activity, multiple Cas12a orthologs were surveyed for knockout efficiency. Seven Addgene-available Cas12a systems were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells to disrupt a GFP reporter in order to measure knockout efficiency. Consistent with published work, <i>Acidaminococcus </i>Cas12a (AsCas12a) demonstrated high gene editing activity. Nevertheless, the knockout efficiency of AsCas12a in human cells is approximately one third of that of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>Cas9 (SpCas9), though AsCas12a is as biochemically active as SpCas9. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it was hypothesized that suboptimal nuclear localization might be partially responsible for low knockout efficiency of AsCas12a. Inspection of the amino acid sequence revealed that there are two potential nuclear export signals (NES) in AsCas12a, one of which is located in the highly conserved catalytic RuvC domain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0197">To address the low knockout efficiency in mammalian cells, the AsCas12a system was subjected to three levels of optimization. In order to evaluate the knockout efficiency of the system, AsCas12a and its crRNA were expressed using a two-vector lentiviral expression strategy and conducted a competition-based cellular proliferation assay, a reliable proxy for dropout screening (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B</figref>). crRNAs targeting known essential genes were designed, including replication protein PCNA and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1. AsCas12a knockout efficiency was then assessed by measuring the negative selection strength of essential gene-targeting crRNAs in a 16-day time-course. First, introducing six NLSs and adding a DR 3&#x2032; of the crRNA, which might protect it from 3&#x2032; exonuclease degradation, significantly increased AsCas12a knockout efficiency in K562 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>D</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Next, knockout efficiency was enhanced by introducing E174R and S542R mutations in AsCas12a that has increased DNA binding affinity and activity, termed enAsCas12a (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>). EnAsCas12a with non-targeting crRNAs and crRNAs targeting introns of PCNA and CDK1 in K562 cells were then tested. Observations found no obvious effect on cellular proliferation, suggesting that the optimized enAsCas12a system was not toxic to the cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Together, these data establish that the combination of 6&#xd7;NLS, dual-DR crRNA, and enAsCas12a protein enhances knockout efficiency (this optimized enAsCas12a system was used for all remaining experiments) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 2: Comparison of enAsCas12a and SpCas9 in a Single-Gene Knockout Genetic Screen</heading><p id="p-0192" num="0198">To benchmark the performance of the enAsCas12a system against SpCas9, a single-gene dropout screen was conducted in order to identify known cancer drug targets. The enAsCas12a- and SpCas9-based screens were performed in a murine Mll-A19/NrasG12D acute myeloid leukemia cell line (RN2), which has been previously used to identify epigenetic dependencies with SpCas9. To start, an enAsCas12a-expressing RN2 cell line (RN2c12) was created (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). The high knockout efficiency of the optimized enAsCas12a system was then verified using crRNAs targeting essential gene Rpa3 and known leukemia dependency Brd41 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). A customized enAsCas12a crRNA library was constructed targeting 155 protein domains involved in epigenetic regulation. Dropout screens in RN2 cells were performed using either this epigenetic-focused enAsCas12a crRNA library or a previously published SpCas9 sgRNA library (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). A CRISPR Score (CS), defined as the average log 2 fold-change of all crRNAs targeting a given protein domain, was used to quantify each domain's essentiality in supporting cancer cell proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).

This recombination, which uncouples paired sgRNA-encoding DNA elements, can occur during lentiviral production, PCR amplification, and deep sequencing. Others have reported 10-40% sgRNA uncoupling in Cas9 systems. It was predicted that the recombination frequency would be significantly lower for AsCas12a, since the length of homologous sequence between two crRNAs is only 19-20 nt, compared to &#x2dc;352 nt in dual-sgRNA Cas9 systems (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). To measure the DNA uncoupling frequency in the enAsCas12a system, a mock genetic screen was performed with a library of unique dual-crRNAs. Observations found a DNA uncoupling frequency of &#x2dc;0.3% in the enAsCas12a dual-crRNA cassette (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), at least 35 times lower than that observed with Cas9.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0201">Next, it was evaluated how well enAsCas12a identifies synthetic sick/lethal genetic interactions in dual-crRNA dropout screening. 21 epigenetic regulatory domains were selected with moderate-to-no effect on proliferation from the single-crRNA enAsCas12a screen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). A dual-crRNA library was then built with 8,281 pairwise combinations using a simple one-step ligation protocol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). A screen in RN2c12 cells was performed and quantified the abundance of crRNA pairs by directly deep sequencing the dual-crRNA expression cassette. As in the cellular competition assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), observations found an apparent crRNA position effect during pooled library screening, where 75% of the experimental crRNA showed a stronger effect in the first position of a dual-crRNA array (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). To account for this position bias, a Gaussian distribution model was used to adjust the dual-crRNA CS (/gCS). When an observed/gCS of two protein domains is significantly, at least two s.d., lower than the expected score from the combination of individual-domain /gCS, this domain pair is considered to have a synergistic interaction. Interestingly, the double knockout screen identified three unexpected synthetic sick interaction pairs, Brd9&#x26;Jmjd6, Jmjd6&#x26;Kat6a, and Brpf1&#x26;Jmjd6, which, when perturbed simultaneously, showed stronger proliferation inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). Jmjd6 appeared in all three pairs, suggesting that its perturbation might sensitize RN2 cells to various stresses.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0202">BRD9 participates in nucleosome remodeling, JMJD6 functions as a protein hydroxylase or histone demethylase, and KAT6A acts a histone acetyltransferase. Based on their known functions, it would not be obvious to predict synergistic interaction of any of these three genes in leukemia. Studies then proceeded to validate Brd9&#x26;Jmjd6 and Jmjd6&#x26;Kat6a interactions because BRD9 and KAT6A small molecule inhibitors are available. Using cellular competition assays, it was confirmed that dual-crRNA knockout of either Brd9&#x26;Jmjd6 or Jmjd6&#x26;Kat6a has a synergistic suppressive effect on RN2 proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Next, chemical inhibitors were used to further validate these two screen-identified hits. Since Jmjd6 crRNAs had a minimal effect on cellular proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>), a stable Jmjd6-deficient RN2c12 cell line was generated and tested for sensitivity to either a BRD9 or KAT6A/B inhibitor. Consistent with the dual-crRNA perturbation data, Jmjd6 knockout sensitized RN2c12 cells to both BRD9 and KAT6A/B inhibitors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>). To further characterize the role of Brd9&#x26;Jmjd6 in leukemia, RNA-seq was performed to compare the global transcription changes upon either single or double genetic perturbation of Brd9 and Jmjd6. This analysis showed that double knockout of Brd9&#x26;Jmjd6 has a cooperative effect on transcription when compared with either single knockout (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>).

To enable a simple yet high-throughput genetic screening of mutagenizing two genes simultaneously, a bacterial immune defense system CRISPR-Cas12a was engineered for robust gene editing in mammalian cells. Cas12a has unique properties that make it an ideal tool for multi-gene targeting. Critically, while studies focused initially on epigenetic regulators in HCC, optimization of the CRISPR-Cas12a system for combinatorial genetic screens is widely applicable across diverse tumor types.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0206">The overarching goal was to identify and elucidate new combinatorial epigenetic dependencies for HCC. Technological advances have expanded the repertoire of loss-of-function genetic approaches with the advent of CRISPR screening: a technology that employs a scalable and rapid, yet simple, programmable nuclease tool to construct genome-wide knockout libraries at known sites to screen for new disease vulnerabilities. Despite these advances, CRISPR-based genetic screening has yet to achieve its potential, as these systems currently do not permit simple and robust combinatorial screening for identification of synthetic lethal and synergistic genetic interactions. In conventional CRISPR screens, the Cas9 protein is guided by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) with a unique stretch of 20 nucleotides complementary to the target genomic DNA to generate a double strand DNA break. In the absence of a homology-directed repair DNA template, these breaks will be repaired through an error prone non-homology end joining pathway, which results in small insertion/deletion (indels) mutations around the break site. By directing the indels within a functionally relevant domain of a gene product, it has been shown that CRISPR-Cas9 can produce a higher fraction of null and hypomorphic mutations. This not only substantially increases the potency of genetic screening but also allows high-throughput identification of protein domains that are suitable drug targets in cancer because this method evaluates protein domain function directly from genetic screening. While the current CRISPR-Cas9 system can efficiently enable single-gene level loss-of-function genetic screening; it presents several major technical challenges for combinatorial genetic screening, which requires efficient knockout of two genes simultaneously in cells. For example, the long and repetitive DNA elements required to express dual Cas9 sgRNAs can cause severe DNA shuffling/swapping, creating technical challenges for pooled sgRNA cloning, deep sequencing, and data analysis. Hence, this inability to robustly and efficiently simultaneously mutagenize two genes in genomic screens limits the discovery of new synthetic lethal and synergistic genetic interactions that may provide novel therapeutic opportunity for disease treatment.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0207">The scientific premise rests on the ability to develop a scalable, CRISPR-Cas12a approach to efficiently mutagenize two epigenetic regulators in a single cancer cell. A new CRISPR-Cas12a system for multiplexed gene editing in mammalian cells was developed. Similar to Cas9, Cas12a is a CRISPR RNA-guided DNA endonuclease. By reprogramming the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequence, Cas12a can be directed to mutagenize the designated target gene. The Cas12a system has unique features that make it an attractive platform for developing a multiplex gene editing toolkit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>); First, Cas12a processes the crRNA array using its intrinsic RNase activity, allowing for simple multi-gene editing with a single crRNA array, and secondly, Cas12a uses a single crRNA for gene editing that is significantly shorter than a Cas9 sgRNA (&#x2dc;42nt of Cas12a vs. &#x2dc;123nt of Cas9), making pooled CRISPR library construction much easier. It is well documented that two pieces of DNA elements will shuffle in a distance- and homology-dependent manner during virus production, PCR, and deep sequencing steps. This is a confounding technical limitation of double gene editing using the conventional Cas9 system. In contrast to the long distance (&#x2dc;352nt) between two sgRNAs in the Cas9 system, the short sequence between two Cas12a crRNAs (&#x2dc;19nt) effectively reduces DNA shuffling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>D</figref>). Moreover, complex combinatorial Cas12a crRNA libraries targeting thousands of genes can be easily cloned through regular T4 ligation.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0208">Despite their advantages, the publicly available Cas12a versions all have low gene editing efficiency in comparison to the commonly used Cas9 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>). To overcome this challenge, studies have advanced and optimized the <i>Acidaminococcus </i>sp Cas12a (referred to as Cas12a) system, resulting in marked improvement in gene editing efficiency. To this end studies have (i) increased the copy number of the nuclear localization sequence, (ii) stabilized the crRNA backbone with additional direct repeat hairpin structures, and (iii) introduced alterations to the Cas12a protein to increase its DNA binding affinity (based on the Cas12a crystal structure, PDB:5B43). Utilizing the improved Cas12a system and a HEK293T GFP reporter cell line, gene editing efficiencies comparable to Cas9 can be achieved (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>), but with the distinctive advantage that the Cas12a system can mutate two genes simultaneously (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref>).

Without wishing to be bound by theory, these findings indicated that the CRISPR RNA-guided Cas12a has unique features that allow efficient multi-gene editing which can be engineered and utilized in combinatorial genetic screens in human and mouse HCC cell lines to identify synthetic lethal and synergistic genetic interactions to inform new therapeutic targets.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">Example 6: Identification of Cell-Autonomous HCC Specific Combinatorial Epigenetic Dependencies</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0209">Alterations in transcription factors and epigenetic regulators are frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, it is unknown whether these genetic alterations are driver mutations. It is also not known whether dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape and the transcriptional circuitry in HCC can create de novo epigenetic dependencies. At the level of a single genetic perturbation, loss-of-function genetic screens against epigenetic regulators performed in HCC yielded a surprisingly small number of epigenetic vulnerabilities, in contrast to the much larger number of vulnerabilities found in other malignancies, such as AML. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it can be hypothesized that single-gene level genetic screens are very likely missing critical epigenetic regulators in HCC. It can be postulated that this is due in part to the potential redundancy of epigenetic regulators, where one regulator can compensate for another to sustain critical epigenetic pathways when its homolog or paralog pathway is perturbed. Single-gene level genetic screens fail to reveal synthetic lethal and synergistic interactions between gene pairs. Hence, strong cancer epigenetic dependencies have yet to be discovered, despite the fact that data (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>) strongly suggests that they are likely to exist.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0210">To comprehensively annotate cell-autonomous epigenetic dependencies in HCC, loss-of-function combinatorial genetic screening was performed in HCC cells using the newly developed Cas12a platform.

Notably, it was observed that knockout of two gene pairs, Brd9/Jmjd6 and Kat6a/Jmjd6, significantly inhibited AML proliferation as compared to individual gene knockout (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>). It was further validated these results through cellular competition assays with individual crRNAs and small molecule inhibitors targeting either Brd9 or Kat6a (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>C</figref>). The genetic interactions observed between Brd9/Jmjd6 and Kat6a/Jmjd6 gene pairs are unexpected, since the nucleosome remodeling (BRD9), histone demethylase (JMJD6), and histone acetyltransferase (KAT6A) activities are not predicted to function synergistically. Without wishing to be bound by theory, these data support the feasibility of performing unbiased combinatorial genetic screens and highlight the possibility of identifying new and unexpected synergistic regulatory pathways for therapeutic intervention.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 7: Identification of Non-Cell-Autonomous HCC Specific Combinatorial Epigenetic Dependencies</heading><p id="p-0208" num="0211">Genetic alterations in cancer not only reprogram the cell into an oncogenic state but also alter its interaction with cells in the local environment allowing escape from host immunosurveillance. By modulating the communication between tumor cells and immune cells, the host immune system can be reactivated to attack the tumor cells. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown notable clinical success in certain tumor types by blocking the interaction of two immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1, in tumor cells, and PD-1, in immune cells. However, as single-agent therapy, ICB has limited efficacy in many tumor types, including HCC. The cancer patient genome sequencing project confirmed the immunosuppressive environment of HCC with few infiltrating anti-tumor immune cells and high expression of immune checkpoint proteins in the tumor. Recent studies suggest that manipulating epigenetic programs in tumor cells can increase anti-tumor immune responses through reactivating human endogenous retroviruses, cancer-testis antigens, and neo-antigens. Since epigenetic regulators are frequently altered in HCC, it was hypothesized that epigenetic pathways in the tumor cells are rewired to suppress host immunosurveillance. To comprehensively identify non-cell-autonomous epigenetic regulators that maintain an immunosuppressive state in HCC, combinatorial loss-of-function in vivo genetic screening was performed using a mouse model of HCC.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0212">To demonstrate the feasibility of identifying epigenetic regulators that modulate the cancer immune microenvironment, several murine tumor models with high CRISPR Cas9-editing efficiency for in vivo protein domain-based genetic screening were developed. A domain-focused Cas9 sgRNA library targeting epigenetic enzymes was created and used to perform three types of genetic screens in a murine melanoma model (B16F10): (i) in vitro, (ii) in vivo, and (iii) in vivo with a PD-1 inhibitor used for ICB therapy. Notably, these single-gene level Cas9 loss-of-function genetic screens identified two histone methyltransferase genes, Setd1b and Setdb1, as non-cell-autonomous dependencies of B16F10 melanoma. These two genes were required for B16F10 melanoma cell proliferation and survival in vivo, but not in cell culture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>), consistent with a non-cell autonomous mechanism. Genetic knockout of Setd1b in B16F10 melanoma cells revealed increased infiltration of NK and cytotoxic CD8 T cells in tumors generated by inoculation of B16F10&#x394;SETD1B melanoma cells into syngeneic wild-type C57Bl/6 mice, and immunoprofiling by flow cytometry. Furthermore, antibody-mediated depletion of either NK or T cells in B16F10&#x394;SETD1B tumor bearing mice partially alleviated the inhibition of B16F10&#x394;SETD1B tumor growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>).
