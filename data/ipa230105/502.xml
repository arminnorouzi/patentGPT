Embodiments of the present invention relate to use of the present bone clamp in treatment of bone deformity disorders such hallux valgus.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Orthopedic procedures used in the repair of broken or deformed bones oftentimes require controlled and accurate realignment of bones and drilling of holes for positioning of fixation devices such as plates, screws, pins and/or wires. Since such implants must be accurately positioned for optimal bone or bone fragment fixation surgeons utilize drill guides to ensure that the drill holes are at a desired position and direction across the bone.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hallux valgus is a disorder associated with outward deformity (varus) of the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal and inward deformity (valgus) of the hallux with frequent cases of rotation of the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal head. Rotation of the head rotates the sesamoids as well and position them in angle to the transverse plane.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a number of minimally invasive approaches have been devised for correcting hallux valgus deformities. These approaches interconnect metatarsal bones under tension in an attempt to restore normal (pre-deformity) bone in the plantar plane and angular position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In cases of hallux valgus disorders in which the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal is deformed outward (primus varus), button (plates) and suture (wire) type implants are used to correct the deformity without osteotomy. To pass the suture from the medial end of the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal to the lateral end of the 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsal (or vs vs) a hole is drilled across the first and second metatarsal bones;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Large diameter holes can cause bone stress fracture especially in the 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsal bone which is of smaller diameter (typically 7-9 mm). For example, a fixation device that uses 2.7 mm diameter hole increases the probability of stress fracture on 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsal (30-40% are reported). As a result, it is desired to drill the 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsal with a smaller diameter holes in the range of 1.1-1.8 mm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due the distance and outward deformity, when drilling small diameter holes across the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsals the drill bit can bend/deflect such that the resulting hole in the second bone can be misaligned with the hole in the first bone thereby leading to misaligned anchoring.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus it would be highly advantageous to have a medical device that can approximate and align two adjacent bones for drilling such that subsequent fixation of the bones is aligned along a desired and predetermined plane/path.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a medical device comprising a first arm and a second arm mounted on a support rail, each of the first arm and the second arm having a bone contacting region; a mechanism for reducing a distance between the bone contacting regions of the first arm and the second arm thereby applying a clamping force to a bone or bones, positioned between the bone contacting regions; and a force gauge for indicating the force applied by the bone contacting regions to the bone or bones.

The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In Hallux Valgus correction surgery, the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal (which is deformed outward) is pushed back towards the 2<sup>nd </sup>metatarsal in order to reduce the angle between the first and second metatarsals [known as Intermetatarsal angle (IMA)] to an acceptable normal value (medically accepted values are less than 9&#xb0;&#x2014;Campbell's Operative Orthopedics). In those surgical methods that avoid any bone osteotomy, the bone is pushed inward by applying force on the 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal bone and a button and suture fixation device holds the 1<sup>st </sup>bone at the desired position (IMA smaller than 9&#xb0;, typically 4-7&#xb0;). The force required for this realignment is about 25-40 N. This procedure necessitates holding the bones during surgery in an anatomically correct position and simultaneously drilling a correct path through the bones for the implant. As such, surgeons often rely upon assistants to hold the bones. Since bone holding and drilling are performed manually the results can be inconsistent and lead to poor fixation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present inventor devised a medical device that can be used to controllably clamp adjacent bones while compensating for bone relocation and rotation during deformity correction. The present device can also be used to guide drilling of holes through two adjacent bones at different trajectories and different directions such that the holes are aligned through a common plane/line and an implant (fixation device) secured therethrough fixates the bones at a desired IMA.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a medical device that can be used to clamp and optionally drill holes in a bone or bones. The medical device of the present invention can be used to clamp any bone in repair of bone trauma (e.g., fracture) or disorder (e.g., bone deformity such as Hallux valgus). The medical (orthopedic) device (also referred to herein as &#x201c;bone clamp&#x201d;) can also be used to guide one or more drill bits in drilling through one or more bones. The device of the present invention can be positioned externally (outside the skin) or internally within the body after exposing the bone and removing soft tissues.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The medical device includes a first arm and a second arm mounted on a support rail (approximately midway along the length of the arms), each arm includes a bone contacting region at a bottom end of the arm and an alignment hole for mounting over a stiff wire (e.g., K-wire). The support rail can be attached to one arm with the other arm movable along its length. The medical device further includes a mechanism for reducing a distance between the bone contacting regions of the arms thereby clamping the bone or bones positioned between the bone contacting regions. The arm movable along the support rail (e.g., second arm) can engage the rail via a ratchet mechanism. Such a mechanism allows stepwise movement of the arm along the rail and can include a release button for releasing the arm (sliding it off the support rail). The ratchet mechanism can include teeth on the support rail and a spring loaded tab for engaging the space between teeth in the second arm. The release button can move the tab out of engagement with the teeth. The ratchet mechanism can be used to first place the device over a bone or bones manually setting a distance and perform initial clamping action. A second mechanism for further reducing the distance between the bone contacting regions of the arms can then be used to apply an inward clamping force (squeezing) on the bone or bones (approximating bone contacting regions). A force gauge mounted on the device can indicate the force applied to the bones by the bone contacting regions of the arms.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The medical device can also include a second (guide) rail for stabilizing the arms (when applying a force to the bones) to prevent torsion or buckling of the arms. Such a guide rail can be fixed to the first arm and slidably engage the second arm through an opening at the top of the arm.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The mechanism for reducing a distance between the bone contacting regions of the arms can include a turn knob mounted over a threaded bar or bars. Turning the knob moves a lower portion of the second arm towards the first arm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bone contacting regions of the arm can be configured for attachment of drill guide adaptors (also referred to herein as &#x201c;drill leads&#x201d;). Such drill leads can include one or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4) drill holes/guides for facilitating drilling of holes in the bones clamped by the present device. The drill leads are attachable and fixed to the arms. Each drill lead can be independently angled (factory set or following attachment by surgeon to enable drilling at different angles with respect to the bone or bones.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bone contacting region has a horizontal bar attached to it. The bar provides reference to the angular position of the device (&#x201c;Leveling bar&#x201d;). The leveling ensures that when more than one hole is drilled in each bone, the holes will be at a desired axis. When the present device is clamped and leveled by the leveling bar along the bone dorsal surface the arms and rails are angled (about 30&#xb0;) in a way that the device does not obscure the surgeon's view of the bones and enables X-ray imaging when required.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention is particularly suitable for correction of bone deformities such as 1<sup>st </sup>metatarsal primus varus by providing a bone clamp that can compensate for bone relocation and rotation during deformity correction using a fixation device such as button and suture device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>8</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of the present bone clamp (referred to hereinunder as device <b>10</b>) which is suitable for use in Hallux valgus repair. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref> illustrate front (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and isometric (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) views of device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates device <b>10</b> in a disassembled state in which arms <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> and drill leads <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are detached.
