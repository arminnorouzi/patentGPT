Accordingly, the control element is used to control the running of the power device to drive the transmission mechanism and the tool head installed on the transmission mechanism, thereby providing sufficient torque to allow the tool head to rotate.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the related-art power tools are torque adjustable devices, and such power tools often continue to rotate after exceeding the predefined torques, leading to the situations of damaged components and reduced useful life of the power tools. Accordingly, there is a need for improvement of such situations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, most of the related-art power tools are installed with torque sensors to detect the torques. In addition, when the predefined torque is reached, a signal is transmitted to the control element to control the power device to stop running. Moreover, the torque sensors of related-art power tools are arranged on the transmission mechanism, and such torque sensors are constantly under the rotational state as they rotate with the running of the transmission mechanism. Consequently, the drawbacks of rupture of cables or improper electrical contact often occur and the electrical connection is affected, leading to damages of the power tool. In addition, during the operation of a power tool, the transmission mechanism connecting to the tool head is also subject to vibration and deformation, such that the torque value detected by the torque sensor arranged on the power tool is affected, thereby reducing the accuracy of the torque sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, the inventor seeks to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks associated with the current technology and aims to provide an effective solution through extensive researches along with utilization of academic principles and knowledge.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Summary of Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a power machine tool, and the power body is able to rotate relative to the housing via the arrangement of the bearing set, such that the power body is under the reverse rotation state when the predefined torque is exceeded. In addition, the torque sensor is able to transmit signal to the control board to stop the running of the power body, thereby preventing the situations of damages of the power device or reduction of useful life.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the aforementioned objective, the present disclosure provides a power machine tool. A housing includes an accommodating space and a working end located on a front end of the accommodating space. The working end includes an opening. A control board is disposed in the accommodating space. A power device is disposed in the accommodating space, and the power device includes a power body electrically connected to the control board, a driving axle driven by the power body, and a protective cover configured to cover the power body. A bearing set is arranged between the protective cover and the housing to make the power body rotate relative to the housing. A transmission mechanism is disposed in the accommodating space and located on a front side of the power device. The transmission mechanism includes an actuating portion. The actuating portion rotates with the driving axle and is extended out of the opening of the housing to drive a tool piece to rotate. A torque axle is disposed in the accommodating space and located on a rear side of the power device opposite to the transmission mechanism. The torque axle is connected to the power device and configured to rotate with the power device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a torque display structure for a power machine tool. The torque sensor is arranged on a rear side of the power device, such that the torque detection is not affected by the vibration of the external tool piece, thereby providing an accurate torque value.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the aforementioned objective, the present disclosure provides a torque display structure for a power machine tool, including a power machine tool and a torque sensor. The torque sensor is arranged in the housing and located on a rear side of the power device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In comparison to the related art, a power machine tool of the present disclosure includes a bearing set arranged between the power body and the housing such that once the predefined torque is exceeded, the power body is able to perform rotation relative to the housing and to be in a reverse rotation state. At the time, the torque sensor is able to transmit signal to the control board to stop the running of the power body, thereby preventing damages of the power device or reduction of useful life. Furthermore, the present disclosure further provides a torque display structure for a power machine tool, and the torque sensor is arranged on a rear side of the power device, such that the torque detection is not affected by the vibration of the external tool piece or any deformation, thereby providing an accurate torque value. Moreover, the arrangement of the torque sensor on the rear end of the housing of the power machine tool is able to further reduce the space on the front end of the housing and to prevent impacts on the power output. Accordingly, the power output may be transmitted to the working end more directly, thereby enhancing the practical use and application.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross sectional view showing a combination of the power machine tool and the torque display structure of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective appearance view of the transmission part of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective exploded view of the transmission part of the present disclosure viewed from one direction; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another perspective exploded view of the transmission part of the present disclosure viewed from another direction.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The technical contents of this disclosure will become apparent with the detailed description of embodiments accompanied with the illustration of related drawings as follows.
