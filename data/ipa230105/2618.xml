For example, solid particles are used as opacifiers and/or pigments in the coatings industry, as filler material in plastics, and in a variety of applications in personal care products. Titanium dioxide particles are one particular example of solid particles used in numerous applications, including, for example, as an opacifier and/or white-coloring pigment in the coatings industry, as filler material in plastics, and as an ultraviolet sunblock in consumer care products. Titanium dioxide pigments provide efficient scattering of light, including visible and ultraviolet light, and therefore impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity to materials.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In numerous applications, solid particles are dispersed in other media. For example, in coating compositions, solid particles functioning as pigments are dispersed in the film-forming resins and/or in the carrier fluids (e.g., water and/or organic solvents) in which the film-forming resins and other components are also dispersed. Likewise, in plastics and consumer care products, solid particles are dispersed in a continuous phase or otherwise homogeneously mixed with other chemical components. However, solid particles do not necessarily readily mix with and/or disperse in resins, solvents, plastics, or other material. Therefore, it would be advantageous to improve the dispersibility of solid particles in various materials, and also improve the homogeneity and stability of solid particle dispersions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A particle composition comprises a solid core particle comprising an outer surface, and a functionalizing layer over at least a portion of the outer surface of the solid core particle. The functionalizing layer comprises a reaction product of a 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound, or a multifunctional form thereof, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also provided is a dispersion comprising a solvent and a particle composition of the particle composition set forth immediately above dispersed in the solvent.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also provided is a coating composition comprising a solvent, a film-forming resin dispersed in the solvent, and the particle composition set forth immediately above dispersed in the solvent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also provided is a process for producing the particle set forth set forth immediately above. The process comprises mixing solid particles in a solvent to form a mixture, adding a 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound, or a multifunctional form thereof, or a combination thereof, to the mixture, and reacting the 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound, or a multifunctional form thereof, or a combination thereof, in the mixture.

For example, a coating layer &#x201c;applied over&#x201d; a substrate does not preclude the presence of one or more other coating layers of the same or different composition located between the applied coating layer and the substrate. Likewise, a second coating layer &#x201c;applied over&#x201d; a first coating layer does not preclude the presence of one or more other coating layers of the same or different composition located between the applied second coating layer and the applied first coating layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As used in this specification, the terms &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; and &#x201c;polymeric&#x201d; means prepolymers, oligomers, and both homopolymers and copolymers.

The term &#x201c;multifunctional form&#x201d; means a compound comprising two or more 1,1-di-activated vinyl groups covalently bonded in one molecule. For instance, a dialkyl methylene malonate is an example of a 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound, and a transesterification adduct of a dialkyl methylene malonate and a polyol is an example of a multifunctional form of a dialkyl methylene malonate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention described in this specification generally relates to compositions comprising functionalized solid particles. The invention described in this specification also relates to dispersions, coating compositions, plastic articles, and other products comprising functionalized solid particles. As provided in further detail below, articles contemplated for use with the functionalized solid particles, dispersions, and coating compositions set forth herein include free-standing structures and mobile entities.

As used in this specification, the term &#x201c;functionalize&#x201d; and variants thereof, when referring to surface treatments of and surface layers over solid particles, means the bonding of overlying organic compounds to underlying solid particles through reactions between functional groups in the organic compounds and surface functional groups on the solid particles. Not being bound to any theory, such bonding may include chemical bonding, such as ionic, covalent, coordinate-covalent, hydrogen bonding and/or physical bonding such as sorption or combination of any thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The solid particles can comprise any solid material in particulate form under ambient conditions, such as, for example, oxides, sulfides, sulfates, selenides, arsenides, cyanides, cyanates, halides, carbonates, hydroxides, nitrates, or nitrides of transition elements and p-block elements, including coordination complexes and/or organometallic complexes of transition elements and p-block elements. Examples include, but are not limited to, such compounds of copper, aluminum, cobalt, manganese, iron, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, lead, titanium, tin, antimony, zinc, barium, indium, or mercury. The solid particles can comprise metal oxide particles, such as, for example, particles comprising titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, zinc oxide, silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide, an iron oxide (e.g., iron(III) oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)-based pigments), a chromium oxide (e.g., chromium(III) oxide (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)-based pigments), or particles comprising an aluminum oxide (e.g., alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)-based particles), or a combination of any thereof. The solid particles can comprise non-oxide particles or pigments such as, for example, carbon black particles and/or organic pigment particles, including organometallic pigments (e.g., carbazole dioxazine crude pigment, azo, monoazo, diazo, naphthol AS, salt type (flakes), benzimidazolone, isoindolinone, isoindoline and polycyclic phthalocyanine, quinacridone, perylene, perinone, diketopyrrolo pyrrole, thioindigo, anthraquinone, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine, flavanthrone, pyranthrone, anthanthrone, dioxazine, triarylcarbonium, quinophthalone pigments, and diketo pyrrolo pyrrole red).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The solid particles can also comprise clay, mica, talc, or zeolites. The solid particles can also comprise metal particles (e.g., aluminum, zinc, copper, silver, gold, platinum, titanium, and the like), or alloy particles (e.g., steel, bronze, and the like). The solid particles can also comprise glass particles (e.g., solid or hollow glass microspheres made of soda-lime glass (A-glass), borosilicate glass (E-glass), and the like). The solid particles can also comprise thermoplastic particles or other polymer particles (e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, polyamides, polyesters, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethanes, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly(ethylene terephthalate), styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, an epoxy-based polymer, polyethers, polyamines, polyacids, polycarbonates, or polysiloxanes).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The solid particles can comprise mixtures of different particles, such as, for example, mixtures comprising titanium dioxide particles, zirconium dioxide particles, zinc oxide particles, silicon dioxide particles, magnesium oxide particles, iron oxide particles, chromium oxide particles, or aluminum oxide particles, or combinations of any thereof. The solid particles can comprise mixed metal oxide particles, such as, for example, barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>). The solid particles can also comprise mixed-phase particles&#x2014;i.e., wherein individual particles comprise two or more discrete oxide phases. Examples of mixed-phase particles include, but are not limited to, titanium dioxide particles comprising an outer coating comprising zirconium dioxide and/or alumina. In such examples, the functionalizing layer is located over at least a portion of the outer surface of the outer coating. In another example, smaller solid particles can decorate the surface of a larger solid particle. For example, nano-scale (e.g., 10-100 nm) titanium dioxide particles can be adsorbed onto, or can be integral surface features of, a larger composite particle comprising a silica core.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Combinations of any of the solid particles described above can also be used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The 1,1-di-activated vinyl compounds can comprise methylene dicarbonyl compounds, dihalo vinyl compounds, dihaloalkyl disubstituted vinyl compounds, or cyanoacrylate compounds, or multifunctional forms of any thereof, or combinations of any thereof.

Such treatments and/or coatings, for example, can be used in the case of metal cans, wherein the treatment and/or coating is used to retard or inhibit corrosion, provide a decorative coating, provide ease of handling during the manufacturing process, and the like. Coatings can be applied to the interior of such cans to prevent the contents from contacting the metal of the container. The coatings applied to the interior of metal cans also help prevent corrosion in the headspace of the cans, which is the area between the fill line of the product and the can lid; corrosion in the headspace is particularly problematic with food products having a high salt content. Coatings can also be applied to the exterior of metal cans. Certain coatings of the present invention are particularly applicable for use with coiled metal stock, such as the coiled metal stock from which the ends of cans are made (&#x201c;can end stock&#x201d;), and end caps and closures are made (&#x201c;cap/closure stock&#x201d;). Since coatings designed for use on can end stock and cap/closure stock are typically applied prior to the piece being cut and stamped out of the coiled metal stock, they are typically flexible and extensible. Coatings for cans subjected to relatively stringent temperature and/or pressure requirements should also be resistant to popping, corrosion, blushing and/or blistering.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0053">Accordingly, the present invention is further directed to a package coated at least in part with any of the coating compositions described above. A &#x201c;package&#x201d; is anything used to contain another item, particularly for shipping from a point of manufacture to a consumer, and for subsequent storage by a consumer. A package will be therefore understood as something that is sealed so as to keep its contents free from deterioration until opened by a consumer. Thus, the present &#x201c;package&#x201d; is distinguished from a storage container or bakeware in which a consumer might make and/or store food; such a container would only maintain the freshness or integrity of the food item for a relatively short period. A package according to the present invention can be made of metal or non-metal, for example, plastic or laminate, and be in any form. An example of a suitable package is a laminate tube. Another example of a suitable package is a metal can. The term &#x201c;metal can&#x201d; includes any type of metal can, container, or any type of receptacle or portion thereof that is sealed by the food/beverage manufacturer to minimize or eliminate spoilage of the contents until such package is opened by the consumer. One example of a metal can is a food can; the term &#x201c;food can(s)&#x201d; is used herein to refer to cans, containers or any type of receptacle or portion thereof used to hold any type of food and/or beverage. The term &#x201c;metal can(s)&#x201d; specifically includes food cans and also specifically includes &#x201c;can ends&#x201d; including easy open ends, which are typically stamped from can end stock and used in conjunction with the packaging of food and beverages. The term &#x201c;metal cans&#x201d; also specifically includes metal caps and/or closures such as bottle caps, screw top caps and lids of any size, lug caps, and the like. The metal cans can be used to hold other items as well, including, but not limited to, personal care products, bug spray, spray paint, and any other compound suitable for packaging in an aerosol can. The cans can include &#x201c;two piece cans&#x201d; and &#x201c;three-piece cans&#x201d; as well as drawn and ironed one-piece cans; such one piece cans often find application with aerosol products. Packages coated according to the present invention can also include plastic bottles, plastic tubes, laminates and flexible packaging, such as those made from PE, PP, PET and the like. Such packaging could hold, for example, food, toothpaste, personal care products and the like. The coating can be applied to the interior and/or the exterior of the package.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0054">In some examples, the coating compositions prepared and used according to the present invention may be substantially free, may be essentially free, and/or may be completely free of bisphenol A and epoxy compounds derived from bisphenol A (&#x201c;BPA&#x201d;), such as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (&#x201c;BADGE&#x201d;). The term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; as used in this context means the coatings compositions contain less than 1000 parts per million (ppm), &#x201c;essentially free&#x201d; means less than 100 ppm, and &#x201c;completely free&#x201d; means less than 20 parts per billion (ppb) of any of the above mentioned compounds, derivatives, or residues thereof.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0055">Additionally, the functionalized solid particles can be used as pigments and/or fillers in thermoplastic and/or thermoset plastic bulk articles. The functionalized solid particles can be dispersed uniformly or non-uniformly in a matrix of the thermoplastic or thermoset plastic bulk material. The functionalized solid particles can typically comprise from 0.01% to 20% by weight of the total combined weight of the thermoplastic and/or thermoset plastic and the functionalized solid particles, or any sub-range subsumed therein, such as, for example, from 0.05% to 5% or from 0.1% to 2%.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0056">Suitable bulk thermoplastic materials in which the functionalized solid particles can be dispersed include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene-terephthalate, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, polyvinylbutyral, polyvinylacetate, and the like. The plastic material in which the functionalized solid particles can be dispersed include thermoset plastics such as polyurethane, melamine, phenolics, acrylics, polyesters, and the like.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0057">The functionalized solid particles described in this specification may exhibit improved dispersibility and dispersion stability and homogeneity in a variety of materials, including solvents, liquid coating resins, solid coating resins, bulk plastics, and the like. The functionalizing layers comprising a reaction product of a 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound, or a multifunctional form thereof, or a combination thereof, allow the chemistry and the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the surfaces of the solid particles to be tuned based on the chemistry of the 1,1-di-activated vinyl compound and/or multifunctional form thereof, which facilitates the stable incorporation of the functionalized solid particles into an increased number of materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">WORKING EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0058">The following working examples are intended to further describe the invention.

It is understood that the various features and characteristics of the invention described in this specification can be combined in any suitable manner, regardless of whether such features and characteristics are expressly described in combination in this specification. The Inventors and the Applicant expressly intend such combinations of features and characteristics to be included within the scope of the invention described in this specification. As such, the claims can be amended to recite, in any combination, any features and characteristics expressly or inherently described in, or otherwise expressly or inherently supported by, this specification. Furthermore, the Applicant reserves the right to amend the claims to affirmatively disclaim features and characteristics that may be present in the prior art, even if those features and characteristics are not expressly described in this specification. Therefore, any such amendments will not add new matter to the specification or claims, and will comply with written description, sufficiency of description, and added matter requirements, including the requirements under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(a) and Article 123(2) EPC.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0132">Any numerical range recited in this specification describes all sub-ranges of the same numerical precision (i.e., having the same number of specified digits) subsumed within the recited range. For example, a recited range of &#x201c;1.0 to 10.0&#x201d; describes all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value of 1.0 and the recited maximum value of 10.0, such as, for example, &#x201c;2.4 to 7.6,&#x201d; even if the range of &#x201c;2.4 to 7.6&#x201d; is not expressly recited in the text of the specification. Accordingly, the Applicant reserves the right to amend this specification, including the claims, to expressly recite any sub-range of the same numerical precision subsumed within the ranges expressly recited in this specification. All such ranges are inherently described in this specification such that amending to expressly recite any such sub-ranges will comply with written description, sufficiency of description, and added matter requirements, including the requirements under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(a) and Article 123(2) EPC. Also, unless expressly specified or otherwise required by context, all numerical parameters described in this specification (such as those expressing values, ranges, amounts, percentages, and the like) may be read as if prefaced by the word &#x201c;about,&#x201d; even if the word &#x201c;about&#x201d; does not expressly appear before a number. Additionally, numerical parameters described in this specification should be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits, numerical precision, and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. It is also understood that numerical parameters described in this specification will necessarily possess the inherent variability characteristic of the underlying measurement techniques used to determine the numerical value of the parameter.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0133">The invention(s) described in this specification can comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the various features and characteristics described in this specification. The terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; (and any form of comprise, such as &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;), &#x201c;have&#x201d; (and any form of have, such as &#x201c;has&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d;), &#x201c;include&#x201d; (and any form of include, such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;including&#x201d;), and &#x201c;contain&#x201d; (and any form of contain, such as &#x201c;contains&#x201d; and &#x201c;containing&#x201d;) are open-ended linking verbs. Thus, a composition, coating, or process that &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; or &#x201c;contains&#x201d; one or more features and/or characteristics possesses those one or more features and/or characteristics, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more features and/or characteristics. Likewise, an element of a composition, coating, or process that &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; or &#x201c;contains&#x201d; one or more features and/or characteristics possesses those one or more features and/or characteristics, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more features and/or characteristics, and can possess additional features and/or characteristics.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0134">The grammatical articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the,&#x201d; as used in this specification, including the claims, are intended to include &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;, unless otherwise indicated. Thus, the articles are used in this specification to refer to one or more than one (i.e., to &#x201c;at least one&#x201d;) of the grammatical objects of the article. By way of example, &#x201c;a component&#x201d; means one or more components, and thus, possibly, more than one component is contemplated and can be employed or used in an implementation of the described compositions, coatings, and processes. Nevertheless, it is understood that use of the terms &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; in some instances, but not others, will not result in any interpretation where failure to use the terms limits objects of the grammatical articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; to just one. Further, the use of a singular noun includes the plural, and the use of a plural noun includes the singular, unless the context of the usage requires otherwise.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0135">Any patent, publication, or other document identified in this specification is incorporated by reference into this specification in its entirety unless otherwise indicated, but only to the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing descriptions, definitions, statements, illustrations, or other disclosure material expressly set forth in this specification. As such, and to the extent necessary, the express disclosure as set forth in this specification supersedes any conflicting material incorporated by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is incorporated by reference into this specification, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth herein, is only incorporated to the extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material. Applicant reserves the right to amend this specification to expressly recite any subject matter, or portion thereof, incorporated by reference. The amendment of this specification to add such incorporated subject matter will comply with written description, sufficiency of description, and added matter requirements, including the requirements under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(a) and Article 123(2) EPC.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002619A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-33" num="01-33"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>33</b>.
