In order to supply more information in the form of video, audio and telephony at higher rates, higher bandwidth communication network upgrades or new deployments are required. Twisted wire pair cable, such as used in plain old telephone services, do not support high bandwidths over a great distance, and while coaxial cables, such as used in cable television services, do a better job, it too has reach and bandwidth limitations. Optical fiber can provide virtually unlimited bandwidth thus enabling broadband and multimedia services.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern telephone wide area network access infrastructures, such as fiber in the loop networks (FITL), utilize a combination of fiber optics and twisted wire pair to send and receive data communications to and from a subscriber. While modern cable wide area network access infrastructures, such as Hybrid Fiber Coaxial networks (HFC), utilize a combination of fiber optic and coaxial cable to send and receive data communications to and from a subscriber. Generally, subscribers are served by twisted wire pair in the last mile or so of the telecommunication networks or by coaxial cable within the last two to three miles or so of cable networks. In order to achieve greater bandwidth rates at a subscriber location, the fiber optic network must be brought closer to the subscriber so that the copper drop (e.g., twisted wire pair or coaxial cable) is of a sufficiently short distance and will be capable of supporting increased data transfer rates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One major problem with bringing fiber cable within a short distance of a subscriber location is the added burden of maintaining the multitude of optical to copper drop sites. These drop sites are network elements that are called optical network units (ONUs) or optical network terminals (ONTs) in telecommunication networks and optical node (or simply a node) in hybrid fiber cable networks and generally serve to convert information between the optical domain of a fiber and electrical domain of a twisted pair or coaxial cable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A significant part of the provisioning and maintenance of these drop sites by Service Providers or their affiliates (e.g., broadband access service provider, application service providers, internet service providers, managed service providers, master managed service providers, managed internet service providers, telecommunication service providers, campus service providers, cable service providers) is supplying the electrical power required. Optical fiber itself is not capable of carrying the electricity to power these drop sites. This creates a challenge in planning, distributing and deployment of electricity to power the drop site energy needs. Furthermore, reserve power must also be provided if the main power supply to the drop site fails and with enough reserve powering capacity capable of meeting performance and reliability requirements of the network for several hours or even days. This is often the case with Lifeline telephony service, which is required in plain old telephone service networks. Lifeline telephone means that the subscriber telephones must remain energized and operational during an AC supply power interruption or outage at the subscriber premise.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The drop sites are typically centrally powered from a Service Provider or affiliates' distributed copper facility or a power node located near a cluster of drop sites, or locally powered from a nearby commercial or utility electrical power source, or with solar photovoltaic energy.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the case of centralized power, power is typically provided over new or existing copper facilities from a central office (CO). Power can also be provided on separate twisted wire pair or coaxial cable that are bonded to the outside of a fiber cable bundle, woven within a fiber optical cable bundle or deployed separately with the fiber during installation of the fiber from the central office. However, centralized power is a strategy that requires a separate power network to be deployed that is separate from the information network. With increasing distances between a central office or head end to the remote drop sites increased voltages are required on the power network to feed the drop site energy needs. Increased voltages raise craft safety issues. Alternatively, the power network may be augmented with power nodes located near a cluster of drop sites, however additional metallic enclosures increase susceptibility to electrical surges caused by lightning and power-line induction. Furthermore, there is the 24-hour a day cost of supplying electricity to the power network, as well as regular maintenance and support of the power network itself including regular replacement of batteries for Lifeline services, which are generally located at the CO or head end.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the case of locally powered drop sites, power is derived near a drop site and reserve power is provided with batteries at the drop site. The primary energy source for this architecture is commercial AC power tapped directly from a power utility's facility. The power supply is placed in a small environmentally hardened enclosure that could be co located with a drop site; however, the batteries are generally in the same enclosure as the drop site. This results in a large number of battery sites and power access points. Generally the cost of this type of system is high primarily due to the cost of connecting drop sites to a commercial power source. Regional power utility companies may insist on metered connections to their power grid, incurring a one-time ac meter installation and connection charge to be levied. Additionally a minimum monthly meter charge may be levied regardless of usage. This poses a major problem when the monthly energy consumption of a drop site is significantly lower than the minimum charge.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of electrically powering the communication network infrastructure locally with solar power, this strategy minimizes some of the disadvantages of centralized and locally powering such as vulnerability to lightning and limited battery reserve, allowing fiber to be the sole distribution facility. Solar panels and large batteries are co-located at drop sites, which power the drop sites continuously without any connection to any power grid. However, its use is limited to areas with direct access to sunlight as the output of solar panels decreases with a reduction in incident solar energy. Therefore, this strategy cannot be used everywhere. In addition, solar power requires batteries of large capacity (Wh) to be installed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As such, a need exists for powering a fiber optic communication network element that brings optical access fiber within a short distance of a subscriber premise or customer location. The electrical powering strategy or architecture of the fiber optic wide area network must be capable of supporting and operating the multitude of drop sites or network elements in a cost effective and maintainable manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, techniques related to local powering of a network element or drop site of a wide area access network by a subscriber terminal, adaptor, router, server, gateway, or customer premise equipment (CPE) which combines an electrical power signal or electricity, which may be derived from subscriber mains power (e.g., AC power), with the electrical data communications as a combined electrical WAN signal over the same communication medium connecting the network element or drop site and the subscriber terminal, adaptor, router, server, gateway or CPE are provided. Certain advantages and/or benefits may be achieved using embodiments of the present invention. For example, the embodiments of the present invention have the advantage of being free of any requirement for additional meter installations or meter connection charges. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention have the advantage of reducing labor installation time and costs and enabling subscriber self installation. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention do not create a separate power network. The information network and the power network are the same network in that they share the same transmission line (e.g., twisted copper wire pair or twisted wire pair, coaxial cable or Ethernet cable), thus the communication network can be powered in a cost effective and maintainable manner.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In general, in one aspect, an embodiment of the invention includes a system for powering a network element of a fiber optic wide area network, such as a fiber in the loop network, which transmits communication data between a central office (CO) and subscriber terminal or customer premise equipment.

On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout several views and embodiments; and wherein cascading boxes below a part designates a plurality of such parts, an exemplary embodiment of an electrical power architecture for a fiber optic wide area network is shown incorporating a subscriber-powered network element, according to the present invention. A FTTC or FTTN network using a PON (e.g., B-PON ITU-T G.983, G-PON ITU-T G.984, XG-PON ITU-T G.987, E-PON IEEE 802.3ah, 10G-EPON IEEE 802.3av, WDM-PON, or RFoG SCTE IPS910) connects a central office (CO) <b>100</b> at the head end of a passive optical distribution fabric (ODF) <b>102</b> to a subscriber premise <b>104</b>. The subscriber premise <b>104</b> may be a residential home, a multi-dwelling unit (MDU), a commercial building, or a cell tower. The passive ODF <b>102</b> is comprised of a plurality of passive optical splitters <b>106</b> and connectors (not shown). An Optical Line Terminal (OLT) <b>108</b>, which is generally located at the CO <b>100</b> but may be located in a remote or outside plant (OSP) cabinet, acts as a central transmission point and an overall controlling device for the network. The OLT <b>108</b> is in communication through the ODF <b>102</b> with a plurality of Optical Network Units (ONUs) <b>110</b> located in neighborhood terminals (also called pedestals) in FTTC networks <b>112</b> or in cabinets in FTTN networks <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The OLT <b>108</b> transmits and receives data to and from the ONUs <b>110</b> in the form of modulated optical light signals of known wavelength through the ODF <b>102</b>. The transmission mode of the data sent over the ODF <b>102</b> may be continuous, burst or both burst and continuous modes. The transmissions may be made in accordance with a time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme or similar protocol. Frequently bi-directional wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is used and although the FTTC/FTTN network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>includes an OLT <b>108</b> in communication with a plurality of ONUs using a plurality of fibers, other implementations of such networks may only use ONTs or some combination of ONUs <b>110</b> and ONTs <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the ONUs and ONTs are generally similar. In other implementations, the ONUs and ONTs may differ in one or more aspects. As previously mentioned, the ONUs and ONTs are drop site network elements that generally, at a high level description, serve to convert information between the optical domain of a fiber and electrical domain of a twisted wire pair wire or possibly coaxial cable.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An ONT is a single integrated electronics unit that terminates the PON and presents native service interfaces to the user or subscriber. An ONU is an electronics unit that terminates the PON and may present one or more converged interfaces, such as xDSL or Ethernet, toward the subscriber. An ONU typically requires a separate subscriber unit to provide native user services such as telephony, Ethernet data, or video. In practice, the difference between an ONT and ONU is frequently ignored, and either term is used generically to refer to both classes of equipment. Although in the hybrid fiber coaxial network case, ONUs/ONTs are called nodes, optical nodes or even taps depending on where the fiber network ends and the coaxial cable network begins.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of an ONU <b>110</b> is comprised of the following functional blocks: a PON transceiver <b>116</b>, a PON client Transmission Convergence Layer (TC-Layer) unit <b>118</b>; a CO modem aggregation and adaptation layer unit <b>120</b>; a plurality of Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL, i.e. ADSL, VDSL, or VDSL2) CO modems <b>122</b>; a plurality of Digital Access Arrangement (DAA) units <b>124</b>; a plurality of DC-to-DC power converters <b>126</b>, and a power supply <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The client PON transceiver <b>116</b> comprises the necessary components to convert optical-to-electrical (O/E) signal communications from the OLT <b>108</b> as well as convert electrical-to-optical (E/O) signal communications and communicate them to the OLT <b>108</b>. The PON transceiver <b>116</b> may be plugged into or comprise an optical port or socket, the optical port serving as a site for coupling to a fiber and for performing the O/E and E/O conversions. Some embodiments of network elements may be made without optical transceivers, however having an optical port for later installation of an optical transceiver. In embodiments of network elements made with an optical transceiver, the optical port and the optical transceiver are essentially the same. Some form factors for PON transceiver <b>116</b> include, but not limited to, SFF, SFP, SFP+, and XFP. The PON transceiver <b>116</b> communicates electrically with the TC-Layer <b>118</b>. The TC-Layer <b>118</b> comprises the functionality of: bundling and sending data into packets or frames; un-bundling and receiving data into packets or frames; managing the transmission of packets or frames on the network via medium access and bandwidth allocation protocols; providing necessary messaging and end point behavior, and checks, reports and may correct for detectable errors. The TC-Layer <b>118</b> communicates with both the PON transceiver <b>116</b> and optionally an 1:N aggregation and CO modem adaptation layer <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The 1:N aggregation and CO modem adaptation layer <b>120</b> has several functions. Modem communications over twisted wire pair transmission lines have lower bandwidth rates than communications over fiber. Thus to efficiently use the higher bandwidth rates of the fiber, the communications from multiple modems may be pooled together. Modem communications from as many as one to some N number, for the purposes of this disclosure, may be aggregated together. In an exemplary embodiment, some 96 modems can be aggregated together.

Since embodiments of the invention use the communication medium used to provide services (e.g., internet access, voice over internet protocol, broadcast TV, video conferencing) to also provide electricity to the network element, additional time and labor to power the network element is saved. Furthermore, self installation by subscribers is possible assuming a Service Provider has established service access to the premise (e.g., fiber connection or copper drop from a fiber). Self installation by a subscriber may be made as simple as plugging power into a wall outlet from the Service Provider provided or Subscriber purchased subscriber terminal (e.g., CPE, set top box, HDTV) and connecting the subscriber terminal to a wall phone jack or coaxial cable outlet. The reduction in installation labor time and cost may be significantly more than the cost of the network element (e.g., ONT) and the subscriber terminal. Additionally, Subscribers and Service Providers benefit from the ease of installation associated with embodiments of the invention due to the reuse of existing premise wiring which may preclude the deployment of new subscriber-premise overlay wiring that may compromise, during installation, the integrity of the subscriber premise thermal insulation, natural gas lines, sewer lines and mains power lines.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b><i>a </i></figref>is an exemplary illustration of a circuit model of an electrical coupling device for coupling data communications and electrical power between a subscriber terminal and a network element.

Power drops lasting longer than a second predetermined interval (e.g., 400 ms) will trigger the subscriber terminal to cease applying electrical power to the transmission line(s) until the subscriber terminal senses (e.g., again through a low level current) the predetermined resistive element of the network element once more. In an alternative embodiment wherein there are multiple subscriber terminals sharing the communication transmission line to the network element, after a first subscriber terminal has sensed the network element and provided electrical power to the network element subsequent subscriber terminals that couple to the communication transmission line can sense the presence of electrical power already on the transmission line and not provide additional power. In yet another alternative embodiment, a subscriber terminal can be powered over a shared communication transmission line from another subscriber terminal.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">It will be appreciated that embodiments of subscriber terminals or network elements may incorporate a large capacitor or small battery that can power the subscriber terminal or network element to support sending a Dying Gasp message. A Dying Gasp message or signal is sent by the subscriber terminal or network element to the head-end or CO letting the head-end or CO (e.g., an OLT) know that a subscriber terminal (Dying Gasp message relayed by the network element for the subscriber terminal) or network element has lost electrical power and is about to go offline. This saves a service provider time by alerting them to what has caused the connection failure. It will be appreciated that the large capacitor or small battery can be part of the power supply of the subscriber terminal or network element or the capacitors of the power supply (i.e., power supply reserves) can be used to support sending a Dying Gasp message. It will be appreciated that the large capacitor, small battery or power supply reserves in some embodiments can power the subscriber terminal or network element to send the Dying Gasp message for 50 ms or sending the Dying Gasp message multiple times. Additionally, parts or subcomponents of the subscriber terminal or network element can be turned off when sensing power loss and the minimum number of subcomponents and network interfaces to support sending the Dying Gasp message maintained with power from the large capacitor, small battery or power supply reserves. Additionally the Dying Gasp message can be a bit indicator in the overhead section of a message frame used for network communications. Furthermore, the Dying Gasp message or signal can be sent between the subscriber terminal and the network element as well.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">It will be appreciated that embodiments of the subscriber terminal or network element can incorporate power status indicators (e.g., LED power status indicators that blink or change color). For example status indicators at the subscriber terminal can indicate whether the subscriber terminal is ready to supply electrical power to the network element or if the subscriber terminal is providing electrical power to network element or if the subscriber terminal has received a Dying Gasp message from the network element. The network element status indicators can indicate whether the network element is receiving electrical power from the subscriber terminal or if the network element is running on battery reserves or if the network element has received a Dying Gasp message from the subscriber terminal (network terminal is running on battery reserves). It will be appreciated there can also be communication status indicators at embodiments of the subscriber terminal or network element to indicate whether or not communication has been established or is taking place (e.g., blinking) between the subscriber terminal and the network element. It will be appreciated that the CO can monitor the power status (e.g., power ready, steady state, on battery reserves) of network elements and subscriber terminals through network administration or management messages or network system alarms.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, an exemplary illustration of the frequency spectrum used by various communication protocols is shown.

For example, using VDSL2 to communicate data between a network element (e.g. ONT/ONU) and a subscriber premise over a twisted wire pair transmission line while remotely powering the network element from the subscriber premise can be accomplished by transmitting DC power (i.e., essentially at zero frequency), AC power at 60 Hz or a DC power signal or AC power signal centered at some frequency other than that used by VDSL2 since VDSL2 occupies frequencies between 25.8 KHz and 30 MHz. In another example, using MoCA to communicate between a network element and a subscriber premise over a coaxial cable while remotely powering the network element can be accomplished by transmitting DC power, AC power at 60 Hz or a DC power signal or AC power signal centered at some frequency other than that used by MoCA since MoCA occupies frequencies between 860 MHz and 1.55 GHz. In yet another example, using ITU-T G.hn to communicate between a network element and a subscriber premise over either a twisted wire pair or coaxial cable transmission line while remotely powering the network element can be accomplished by transmitting a DC power, AC power at 60 Hz or a DC power signal or AC power signal centered at some frequency other than that used by ITU-T G.hn since ITU-T G.hn occupies frequencies between 25.8 KHz and 100 MHz-150 MHz range or bands (depending on speed mode of G.hn network).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Alternatively, while not preferred, embodiments of the invention transmitting power remotely from the subscriber premise to the network element on a frequency occupied, at least in part, by the communication signals used to communicate between the network element and the subscriber premise are envisioned to be possible. The transmitted electrical power would raise the noise power in the communication protocol's frequency spectrum, however as long as the communication signals are transmitted at power levels greater than the raised noise power, communications between the network element and the subscriber premise are still be possible. For example, modern xDSL (e.g., adsl, adsl2, vdsl, vdsl2) modems or G.hn modems measure the noise power spectrum encountered on their transmission lines dynamically or constantly. This information is used to determine the power level of their communication signal transmissions. Therefore, the rise in noise power from remotely transmitting electrical power from the subscriber premise to supply the network element at a frequency that overlaps with the communication frequencies may be compensated by the xDSL modems raising their communication signal transmission levels. However, modems with communication signal power levels beyond conventional signal power levels may be needed. Additionally, the subscriber premise xDSL or G.hn modem should observe the power spectral density or make a spectral density estimation of the twisted wire pair transmission line before any transmission, which can then be used to determine the power levels to supply power and data signals to the network element.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It will be appreciated that while embodiments of the invention have been shown or referenced employing different methods of injecting electrical power to the network element at different locations, any method or combination of injection methods and locations can be employed and injecting electrical power to supply the network element from the subscriber electrical power mains can occur anywhere along the communication transmission line between the subscriber terminal and the network element.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">It will be appreciated that embodiments of subscriber terminals and network elements can employ power saving modes and that electrically powering the network element from subscriber mains power over the same medium used for communication as previously described in embodiments of the invention do not prohibit using power saving modes.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">It will be appreciated that while progressively powering a network element (e.g., an ONU) has previously been discussed, an embodiment of a network element can employ electrical power load balancing among subscriber terminals that are supplying the network element with electrical power. Additionally, in an alternative embodiment, network administration or management messages can be exchanged between subscriber terminals and network elements wherein subscriber terminals adjust the voltage or current of their electrical power signal supplying the network element responsive to a network message received from the network element or from the CO.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although the invention has been described in terms of particular implementations or embodiments, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of this teaching, can generate additional implementations, embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the claimed invention.
