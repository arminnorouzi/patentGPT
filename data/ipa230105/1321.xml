Moreover, quality in domestic mains supplies may deteriorate because of such factors as drought, contamination (such as by plastics and micro-plastics as these contaminate the water supply) ageing infrastructure and inability to cope with future demand</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Distillation provides one solution to this problem, but previous distillation plants tended to be energy hungry, large, unwieldy, uneconomical and suitable only for large scale supplies, such as for a town.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be useful to provide such apparatus for more individual or localised use, such as within a kitchen or a communal water source, and servicing potentially a smaller number of people and suitable for use with smaller and more marginal supplies.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such water may be necessary for hospital supplies, drinking water, clinics, laboratories, remote dwellings and villages; in short, anywhere it may be advantageous to improve the quality of the water available.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the apparatus may be of use in applications where distillation may be necessary to create or improve a product, such as small-scale alcoholic beverage production or soft drink dispensing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a distillation apparatus comprising an evaporation chamber, a heat source arranged to provide heat to the evaporation chamber, one or more condensing chamber(s) located at least partially adjacent the evaporation chamber, a fluid inlet connected to the evaporation chamber, one or more fluid outlets attached to the one or more condensing chambers and a vapour compressor pump.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">By being adjacent, heat transfer may take place between the condensing chamber(s) and the evaporation chamber. Specifically, pre-evaporated liquid within the evaporation chamber may receive heat from vapour within the condensing chamber(s), thereby improving the vapour s condensation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The condensing chamber(s) may be located at least partially within the evaporation chamber.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The condensing chamber(s) may be located wholly within the condensing chamber.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The evaporation chamber may have an additional fluid outlet.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The evaporation chamber may be provided with a steam inlet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The evaporation chamber may be provided with a vent outlet.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There may be multiple condensing chambers.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There may be four condensing chambers.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The condensing chamber(s) may comprise a cuboidal shape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The condensing chamber(s) may have a larger internal and/or external surface area than the internal surface of the evaporation chamber. Steam to surface heat transfer is less than liquid to surface heat transfer. This may be improved/mitigated by having enhanced surfaces inside the condensing chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The condensing chamber(s) may comprise a square face with relatively thin connecting webs. This may enhance the internal and/or external surface area of the condensing chamber.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The condensing chamber(s) may comprise a cuboidal shape with a width:height:depth ratio of 20:20:1.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The condensing chamber(s) may include one or more internal condenser fin(s)s. These may increase the internal surface area of the condenser(s) to improve condensation.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The internal condenser fin(s) may comprise rectangular fins projecting generally perpendicularly internally from either or both of the square faces.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The internal condenser fin(s) may comprise L-shaped sections attached to an interior side wall of the condenser(s). These may also comprise U-shaped, W-shaped, or other suitable shapes to increase surface area.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The condenser(s) may include an internal honeycomb structure. This may be to improve condensation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The condenser(s) may include an internal latticework structure.

This may allow distillate to fall into the pump under the action of gravity.

An evaporation drain pipe <b>619</b> is provided on the evaporation chamber <b>612</b>. In the present embodiment these are provided adjacent each other and communicate with the bottom of the evaporation chamber <b>612</b>. The fluid inlet <b>618</b> allows the evaporation chamber <b>612</b> to be filled with liquid to be distilled, and the evaporation drain pipe <b>619</b> allows liquid to be emptied from the chamber <b>612</b>.

The condensing chambers <b>616</b> comprise a square face with relatively thin connecting webs in the present embodiment.

In the present embodiment there are two ceramic bearings <b>640</b><i>a</i>, <b>640</b><i>b</i>, and these are a standard ball-bearing type two-way bearing. Although not specifically a thrust bearing, the bearings <b>640</b><i>a</i>, <b>640</b><i>b </i>provide a degree of resistance to any longitudinal displacement of the rotor <b>636</b> along the axle <b>638</b> and thrust bearings may be substituted. The axle <b>638</b> is fixed (i.e. does not rotate), but in the alternative, an axle may be mounted upon bearings with the rotor fixed to the axle, such that it would be the axle and rotor assembly that would rotate in unison, rather than the rotor about the axle.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The pump body <b>632</b> comprises a first body part <b>642</b>, an intermediate body part <b>644</b>, a sealing lid <b>646</b> and a retaining compression ring <b>648</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The first body part <b>642</b> is a generally flat cylinder (whose length to diameter ratio is in the approximate range of 1:2 to 1:4).
