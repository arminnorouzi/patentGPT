In some examples, the unfolder switches <b>1000</b>, <b>1002</b> may be maintained in a closed and conducting position while converting AC power to DC power. In other examples, the unfolder switches <b>1000</b>, <b>1002</b> may be maintained in an open and non-conducting position, but body diodes thereof may remain conductive.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Accordingly, examples have been provided in which a bi-directional AC/DC converter converts AC power to DC power and/or converts DC power to AC power. Various modifications to the examples provided are within the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, although in some examples the interleaved bridges <b>308</b> may include two half-bridges (including, for example, the first upper switch <b>514</b> and the first lower switch <b>518</b>, and the second upper switch <b>516</b> and the second lower switch <b>520</b>), in other examples the interleaved bridges <b>308</b> may include more than two half-bridges. A ripple current of the bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>300</b> (for example, in inductors coupled to the half-bridges, such as the inductors <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>) may be reduced by adding additional half-bridges. In some examples, a control scheme of respective bridge switches in the additional half-bridges may be altered based on a number of additional half-bridges. For example, a phase shift between the carrier signals corresponding to each of the half-bridges may be described by the function 2&#x3c0;/N, where N is equal to a number of half-bridges. In some examples, each additional half-bridge may be coupled to a corresponding additional inductor.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Furthermore, as discussed above, the bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>300</b> may be implemented in various configurations, including as the first bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>204</b> and/or the second bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>214</b>. However, it is to be appreciated that the bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>300</b> may be implemented in a variety of other configurations. For example, the bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>300</b> may be implemented in devices other than UPSs, or may be a stand-alone device. Accordingly, no limitation is implied by examples in which the bi-directional AC/DC converter <b>300</b> is implemented in connection with UPSs, which are provided for purposes of explanation only.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment, it is to be appreciated various alterations, modifications, and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and improvements are intended to be part of, and within the spirit and scope of, this disclosure. Accordingly, the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
