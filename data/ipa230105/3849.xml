When the emitted laser encounters the target, itis reflected and then received by the detection system. The distance between the target and the lidar may be determined by measuring the time period between emission and reception (time-of-flight method). And a three-dimensional image may be finally achieved after scanning and detecting are performed on the entire target region. As a common ranging sensor, a lidar has the advantages of long detection distance, high resolution, robust anti-active interference capability, small volume, and light weight, and has been widely applied to the fields such as intelligent robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, or unmanned driving technologies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, in lidar's real applications, as an emitting optical path and a receiving optical path have different axes, the locations of light spots imaged on the detector are different at different reflection distances. For a coaxial lidar (such as scanning galvanometer lidar or similar field-of-view scanning lidar), a light spot drift may occur due to slight rotation of scanning galvanometer during the period of laser emission and reception within the time of flight. In addition, shift of light spot on the detector may also occur due to mechanical deformation resulting from hardware aging, glue deformation, and thermal expansion and cold contraction inside the lidar device. To solve these problems, the photosensitive area on the detector needs to be enlarged to ensure that the light spot always drifts within the photosensitive region of the detector.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the enlargement of the photosensitive area of the detector will increase field of view of the receiving optical path, which, in turn, increases ambient light received by detector and weakens the capability of the system to suppress the ambient light. In addition, the enlargement of the photosensitive area of the detector will also increase dark current/dark count, resulting in a reduced capability of the system to detect small signals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, the detector commonly used by lidar is an avalanche photodiode (APD). The size of the photosensitive surface of the APD is fixed, and as a result, it is impossible to realize dynamic adjustment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The content of the background merely represents technologies known to the inventor, and does not necessarily represent the conventional technologies in this field.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of at least one defect in the conventional technologies, the present disclosure provides a detection unit of a lidar, a lidar including the detection unit, and a detection method of the lidar.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides a detection unit of a lidar, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a detector array, including a plurality of individually addressable photodetectors, where the photodetector is configured to receive an echo of a detection beam emitted by the lidar and reflected by a target object, and convert the echo into an electric signal;

It should be understood that the y embodiments described herein are merely used to illustrate and explain the present disclosure, but are not intended to limit the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a detection unit <b>10</b> of a lidar according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A detailed description will be given below with reference to the accompanying drawings. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the detection unit <b>10</b> includes a detector array <b>100</b> and a control unit <b>200</b>. The detector array <b>100</b> includes a plurality of micro units, and one micro unit is circled by a dashed line part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each micro unit includes a photodetector <b>101</b> configured to convert an echo of a detection beam emitted from the lidar and reflected by a target object into an electric signal. The photodetector is, for example, a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) with single photon detection capability. The description is made below by using the SPAD as an example. A reverse current of the SPAD is extremely weak when there is no illumination. The reverse current increases rapidly in an avalanche pattern when at least one photon is incident on the SPAD. An avalanche current generated on the SPAD needs to be quenched in time to prepare for detection of a next photon. A passive quenching mode of the SPAD is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the SPAD needs to operate together with a quenching resistor <b>103</b>. When the SPAD generates a current due to illumination, the current generates a partial voltage across the quenching resistor <b>103</b>, to reduce a bias voltage of the diode below a reverse breakdown voltage value, to avoid further avalanches. An address line <b>102</b> is connected with each SPAD, so that the addressing of individual SPADs can be achieved. The control unit <b>200</b> of the lidar is connected to a plurality of SPAD<b>101</b> through a plurality of address lines <b>102</b>, and can selectively read electric signals of a subset of SPAD<b>101</b>. For simplicity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> only schematically shows a connection between the control unit <b>200</b> and three address lines <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the echo of the detection beam emitted from the lidar and reflected by the target object forms a light spot <b>202</b> on the detector array <b>100</b>. A shaded region <b>203</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> covers the light spot <b>202</b>. Therefore, the control unit of the lidar may only read electric signals of a subset of SPAD<b>101</b> corresponding to the shaded region <b>203</b>, thereby accurately detecting the echo of the lidar without reading electric signals outputted by the entire detector array <b>100</b>, which is equivalent to reducing an effective photosensitive area of the detection unit, thereby effectively suppressing the impact of ambient light, reducing dark current/dark count, and improving capability of the system to detect small signals. The size of the shaded region <b>203</b> is basically consistent with that of the light spot <b>202</b>, which improves the capability of the system to suppress ambient light.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of dynamically adjusting a photosensitive region according to a time of flight.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the control unit <b>200</b> is coupled to the detector array <b>100</b>. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the control unit <b>200</b> is configured to predict a location on the detector array <b>100</b> for a light spot of the echo of the detection beam reflected by the target object according to a time of flight t of the detection beam emitted by the lidar, thereby only reading an output electric signal of a subset of photodetector corresponding to the predicted location for the light spot. Details are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A solid line circle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically shows a received light spot <b>302</b> at an initially-preset location, that is, a location where a laser reflected from an infinite distance is focused on the detector array. A dark color region shows an initially preset photosensitive surface <b>303</b>, and the photosensitive surface <b>303</b> may cover the location of the initial light spot <b>302</b>. The location for the light spot shifts after the time of flight t has passed, and the shift may be obtained through calculation below. A dashed line circle schematically shows a shifted received light spot <b>304</b> obtained through prediction. A light color region shows an adjusted photosensitive surface <b>305</b>, and the photosensitive surface <b>305</b> may cover the received light spot <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0086">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of photodetectors <b>101</b> all remain in an activated state during operation of the lidar. By updating addresses of a subset of the photodetectors <b>101</b> to be read in the detection unit, that is, by reading electric signals of the subset of the photodetectors <b>101</b> corresponding to the adjusted photosensitive surface <b>305</b>, the location of an effective photosensitive surface may be dynamically adjusted. Therefore, it is ensured that all optical signals can be effectively received, and there is no need to read electric signals of the photodetector <b>101</b> other than the effective photosensitive surface, which improves the capability of the system to suppress ambient light.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032; of a lidar according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032; may be used for replacing the detector array <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and differences between the detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032; and the detector array <b>100</b> are mainly described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In addition, unless otherwise stated, features of the detector array <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be used for a detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032; includes a plurality of photodetectors <b>101</b>, and the photodetectors <b>101</b> are arranged in an array and are individually addressable, which is the same as the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. All the photodetectors <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> always remain in an activated state (a bias voltage of the micro unit is higher than the reverse breakdown voltage), and the control unit only reads electric signals of a subset of SPAD<b>101</b>. In an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the control unit <b>200</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is coupled to the detector array <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and is configured to predict a location on the detector array for a light spot of the echo of the detection beam reflected by the target object according to a time of flight of the detection beam emitted by the lidar, and a difference from the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is that, the control unit <b>200</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> energizes only a subset of the photodetectors <b>101</b> corresponding to the light spot in the detector array <b>100</b> to be in an activated state, and reads electric signals of the subset of the photodetectors. And other photodetectors <b>101</b> are in a deactivated state (the bias voltage of the micro unit is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage), the close state means that the photodetector is unresponsive regardless of whether there is photon illumination. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, photodetectors located in the middle of the photodetector array, for example, photodetectors identified by a dashed line box are displayed as a different color from surrounding photodetectors, which indicates that the photodetectors in the middle with a different color are in an activated state and can detect the echo of the lidar. However, the surrounding photodetectors are in a deactivated state and cannot detect the echo of the lidar.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0088">In view of this, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, in addition to a plurality of address lines configured to be connected to the photodetectors for reading electric signals, the control unit <b>200</b> further includes a plurality of energizing lines respectively coupled to the photodetectors <b>101</b> and configured to control on or off of the photodetectors <b>101</b> (the quenching mode is not shown in the figure for simplicity), and details are described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a drive circuit for each photodetector <b>101</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the drive circuit includes a Zener diode <b>104</b> and a switching device <b>105</b>. The photodetector <b>101</b> is connected to a drive voltage through the Zener diode <b>104</b>. The switching device <b>105</b> is coupled at two ends of the Zener diode <b>104</b>, and on or off of the switching device <b>105</b> is controlled by the control unit <b>200</b>, for example, the control unit <b>200</b> may be coupled to a control terminal of the switching device <b>105</b> to control the on or off of the switching device <b>105</b> and control whether the Zener diode is short-circuited or not. For example, when the switching device <b>105</b> is turned on, the Zener diode <b>104</b> is short-circuited, the photodetector <b>101</b> is directly coupled to a drive voltage V<sub>op</sub>, and the photodetector <b>101</b> is activated. When the switching device <b>105</b> is turned off, the Zener diode <b>104</b> is not short-circuited, the voltage at two ends of the photodetector is obtained by subtracting V<sub>zener </sub>from V<sub>op </sub>(where V<sub>zener </sub>is a Zener voltage of the Zener diode), which is lower than a reverse breakdown voltage V<sub>BR </sub>of the photodetector <b>101</b>, and therefore, the photodetector <b>101</b> is disabled. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a Zener voltage of the Zener diode V<sub>zener</sub>&#x2265;V<sub>ov </sub>(where V<sub>ov </sub>is an over-bias voltage of the photodetector <b>101</b>), drive voltage V<sub>op</sub>=V<sub>ov</sub>+V<sub>BR</sub>, where V<sub>op</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>zener</sub>&#x2264;V<sub>BR </sub>is met. Since the foregoing devices are all semiconductor devices, the devices can be constructed as an integrated circuit in principle. In this way, the devices are integrated on each photodetector, so that the photodetector is activated to be quickly turned on and off.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0090">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the switching device may include a field-effect transistor FET, where a gate of the switching device is used as a control terminal connected to the control unit <b>200</b> through the energizing line; and a source and drain of the switching device are respectively connected to two ends of the Zener diode. Alternatively, the switching device may also include a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the photodetector is a single-photon detector.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0091">The inventor found that, the size of the light spot may change to a certain extent with the change of distance, and the size of the received light spot is related to the size of an emitting light spot, the size of a receiving lens, the focal length, and the distance. To be specific, a closer target object indicates a larger light spot. The size of the light spot does not greatly change when the target object is far away from the lidar. Generally, the size of the light spot may obviously change when the distance between the target object and the lidar is within several meters, and an exemplary value may be obtained according to optical simulation. Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, during the prediction of the received light spot <b>304</b> based on the calculation of the time of flight, in addition to calculating the location for a center of the received light spot <b>304</b>, the size of the received light spot <b>304</b> may also be calculated. For example, a longer time of flight indicates a smaller received light spot <b>304</b>. On the contrary, a shorter time of flight indicates a larger received light spot <b>304</b>. Therefore, the area of the photosensitive surface <b>305</b> can be appropriately adjusted. The detailed description is made below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows two target objects at different distances from the lidar, that is, a first target object OB<b>1</b> and a second target object OB<b>2</b>, where the first target object OB<b>1</b> is farther from the lidar. Generally, after being focused by the receiving lens, a focusing location of a reflected echo of a target object farther from the lidar is closer to a focal plane of the lidar, and the photodetectors are all arranged on the focal plane of the receiving lens. Therefore, the size of the light spot of the echo irradiated on the photodetector array is smaller. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the area of a light spot irradiated on the photodetector array by an echo generated by the first target object OB<b>1</b> is significantly smaller than the area of a light spot irradiated on the photodetector array by an echo generated by the second target object OB<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0092">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the pre-set area of the photosensitive surface is adjustable, which may be dynamically adjusted according to the distance of the target object. For example, a smaller photosensitive surface is pre-set for a farther target object, that is, electric signals of less photodetectors are read, or less photodetectors are activated and electric signals are read; and a larger photosensitive surface is pre-set for a closer target object, that is, electric signals of more photodetectors are read, or more photodetectors are activated and electric signals are read, and in this case, the area of the photosensitive region is similar to the size of the received light spot. Alternatively, the size of the photosensitive surface pre-set in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be fixed, for example, the size may be subject to the size of a light spot reflected to the focal plane by a target object at an infinite distance an infinite distance. In this case, the target object at a closer distance has a reflected echo of higher intensity, and reading electric signals of a subset of the photodetectors corresponding to actually irradiated light spot will not affect detection. Alternatively, different sizes of the photosensitive surface are pre-set for target objects at different distances. For example, in a case that the distance between the target object and the lidar is greater than 5 meters, the control unit selects a first photosensitive surface size, for example, the size of the light spot reflected to the focal plane by the target object at an infinite distance; and in a case that the distance between the target object and the lidar is less than 5 meters, the control unit selects a second photosensitive surface size, for example, the size of a light spot reflected to the focal plane by the target object 5 meters away from the lidar.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0093">The present disclosure further relates to a lidar including the detection unit <b>10</b> as described above.
