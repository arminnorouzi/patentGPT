In particular, the operating sensor device and the further operating sensor device are so close together, in particular arranged, in particular integrated in each other, that the operating sensor device and the further operating sensor device can be activated at the same time by the hand of the user. The method includes the step: if the detected sequence corresponds to the given sequence, especially if it is equal to it, enabling a calibrating of the further operating sensor device. This makes it possible to trigger the enabling of the calibrating of the further operating sensor device by an activating of the operating sensor device. This enables a synergistic effect. In particular, the further operating sensor device can be electrical. In addition or alternatively, the operating sensor device and the further operating sensor device can be at least partially, especially entirely, on or above each other, or in particular arranged in this way. Further in addition or alternatively, the enabling can be automatic.
