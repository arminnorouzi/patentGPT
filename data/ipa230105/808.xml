Understanding of various epigenetic mechanisms, like histone modification, DNA methylation, small non-coding RNAs, and gene functionality and regulation has revealed the pathophysiology of various disorders. Research has documented those mutations affecting the DNA Damage Recovery Pathways often lead to mutations in genes as well as alterations in epigenetic signaling of genes including BRCA1, BRCA2. Together, these mutations and signaling abnormalities turn off apoptosis signals or turn on senescence signals that leave these cells susceptible to mutation, infection, and toxins. Current genetic scanning technology detects these cellular conditions as abnormal gene sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, abnormal morphologies, abnormal protein folding patterns and decreased functionality. In some cases, these mutations are somatic cell abnormalities only, and their resolution resolves the present disease condition. However, some mutations are germline mutations that, if not corrected, will possibly be inherited by future generations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of viral infections, many attempts have been made at producing vaccines, with limited success. In the case of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Simian Virus (SV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Coronavirus and viral Hepatitis, few agents are effective at halting the progression of an active infection and none are known to succeed at destroying the virus in the cell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of bacterial infections, the growing phenomenon of drug-resistant microbes is presenting new challenges to those battling bacterial infections. For example, the growing proportion of patients with drug-resistant, hospital-acquired infections and the growing number of people exhibiting Tuberculosis (TB) infections that are either multiple drug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) present a challenge of near-crisis proportions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, there is a need for a therapeutic agent that can be easily administered and is effective in the treatment of viral and bacterial infections and in possibly preventing and treating genetic disorders.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A list of the genes that are subject to regulation includes APC, ATM, BAP1, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, DICER1, EPCAM, FH, GREM1, HOXB13, MITF, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, POLD1, POLE, PPM1D, PTCH1, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11 and TP53.

The APC protein acts as a tumor</entry></row><row><entry>pathway</entry><entry>suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast</entry></row><row><entry>regulator</entry><entry>or in an uncontrolled way. It helps control how often a cell divides, how it</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>attaches to other cells within a tissue and whether a cell moves within or away</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the number of chromosomes</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>in a cell is correct following cell division. The APC protein accomplishes these</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>involved in cell attachment and signaling.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>One protein with which APC associates is beta-catenin. Beta-catenin helps</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>control the activity (expression) of particular genes and promotes the growth</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>and division (proliferation) of cells and the process by which cells mature to</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>carry out specific functions (differentiation). Beta-catenin also helps cells</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>attach to one another and is important for tissue formation. Association of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>APC with beta-catenin signals for beta-catenin to be broken down when it is</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>no longer needed.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancers: Turcot Syndrome, gastric cancers, primary</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with other conditions: desmoid tumors associated</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Most people with FAP will develop</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>colorectal cancer.</entry></row><row><entry>ATM:</entry><entry>The ATM Gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located</entry></row><row><entry>serine/threonine</entry><entry>primarily in the nucleus of cells where it helps control the rate at which cells</entry></row><row><entry>kinase</entry><entry>grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>system and the immune system. Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands. DNA can be damaged by agents</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of the cell's genetic information.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>great interest in cancer research.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ATM mutations can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>cerebellum).

Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and</entry></row><row><entry>associated</entry><entry>dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Although it is unclear exactly</entry></row><row><entry>protein 1</entry><entry>how changes in BAP1 function lead to BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>researchers speculate that altered activity of proteins normally regulated by</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>BAP1 deubiquitination may promote cell proliferation or survival, resulting in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>tumor formation.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancers: cholangiocarcinoma, melanoma, uveal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>melanoma.</entry></row><row><entry>BARD1</entry><entry>The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer specifically mediates the formation of &#x2018;Lys-6&#x2019;-</entry></row><row><entry>BRCA1</entry><entry>linked polyubiquitin chains and coordinates a diverse range of cellular</entry></row><row><entry>associated RING</entry><entry>pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional</entry></row><row><entry>domain 1</entry><entry>regulation to maintain genomic stability. Plays a central role in the control of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>the cell cycle in response to DNA damage.

Both function as</entry></row><row><entry>dependent</entry><entry>tumor suppressors, which means they keep cells from growing and dividing</entry></row><row><entry>kinase inhibitor</entry><entry>too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Both proteins are also involved in</entry></row><row><entry>2A</entry><entry>stopping cell division in older cells (senescence).</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancers: bladder, head and neck squamous cell,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>lung, melanoma.</entry></row><row><entry>CHEK2:</entry><entry>The protein encoded by this gene is a cell cycle checkpoint regulator and</entry></row><row><entry>checkpoint</entry><entry>putative tumor suppressor. It contains a forkhead-associated protein</entry></row><row><entry>kinase 2</entry><entry>interaction domain essential for activation in response to DNA damage and is</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>rapidly phosphorylated in response to replication blocks and DNA damage.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>When activated, the encoded protein is known to inhibit CDC25C phosphatase,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>preventing entry into mitosis, and has been shown to stabilize the tumor</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>suppressor protein p53, leading to cell cycle arrest in G1. In addition, this</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>protein interacts with and phosphorylates BRCA1, allowing BRCA1 to restore</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>survival after DNA damage.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancers: Li-fraumeni Syndrome, ovarian, prostate,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>breast.</entry></row><row><entry>DICER1:</entry><entry>The DICER1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in</entry></row><row><entry>ribonuclease III</entry><entry>regulating the activity (expression) of other genes. The Dicer protein aids in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>the production of a molecule called microRNA (miRNA). MicroRNAs are short</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Dicer cuts (cleaves) precursor RNA</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>molecules to produce miRNA.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancers: lungs, kidneys, ovaries, thyroid.</entry></row><row><entry>EPCAM:</entry><entry>The EPCAM Gene provides instructions for making a protein known as</entry></row><row><entry>epithelial cell</entry><entry>epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM). This protein is associated with</entry></row><row><entry>adhesion</entry><entry>epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the</entry></row><row><entry>molecule</entry><entry>body. The EpCAM protein is found spanning the membrane that surrounds</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>epithelial cells, where it helps cells stick to one another (cell adhesion). In</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>addition, the protein in the cell membrane can be cut at a specific location,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>releasing a piece called the intracellular domain (EplCD), which helps relay</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>signals from outside the cell to the nucleus of the cell. EplCD travels to the</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>nucleus and joins with other proteins, forming a group (complex) that</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>regulates the activity of several genes that are involved in many cell processes,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>including growth and division (proliferation), maturation (differentiation), and</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>movement (migration), all of which are important processes for the proper</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>development of cells and tissues.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with other conditions: Lynch Syndrome, congenital</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>tufting enteropathy.</entry></row><row><entry>FH:</entry><entry>The FH Gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fumarase (also</entry></row><row><entry>fumarate</entry><entry>known as fumarate hydratase).

On</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>the basis of this role, the protein produced from the HOXB13 Gene is called a</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>transcription factor. The HOXB13 protein is part of a large group of</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>transcription factors called the homeobox protein family. The HOXB13 protein</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>is thought to play a role in the development and maintenance of the skin. It</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>also acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Mutations associated with cancer: prostate</entry></row><row><entry>MITF:</entry><entry>The MITF Gene provides instructions for making a protein called melanocyte</entry></row><row><entry>melanocyte</entry><entry>inducing transcription factor.

The composition includes a dry admixture of L-Carnitine tartrate, pyridoxal-5&#x2032;-phosphate, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) and fumaric acid. The disclosed composition may include L-Carnitine tartrate in a range of about 34-90%, pyridoxal-5&#x2032;-phosphate in a range of about 5-33%, fumaric acid in a range of about 0.5-33%, and pyridoxine in a range of about 5-33%. The disclosed composition may act by entering somatic and germline cells and enabling the mitochondria to repair the defects and restore non-mutated homeostasis to the cell and its intracellular signaling.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">The disclosed composition demonstrated success in improving gene functionality and resolving genetic deficiency in above listed SNPs, thus making way to correct the mutations over time Experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the composition in encoding for proteins and correcting genetic SNPs that drive essential biological processes, such as development and differentiation, and when dysregulated, the potential development of complex diseases. Overall, 36,900 tests were performed by PCR to determine gene functionality in the genes listed in Table 2. All genes that were tested having functionality less than 80 percent were included in the study. Within 12 months, all genes tested previously had improved to at least a 93-100 percent functionality. This method can help elucidate previously undetected changes occurring in disease states, in response to therapeutics, under different environmental conditions. Overall, 36,900 tests were performed on the genes listed in Table 2 to confirm greater than 92.99% functionality after taking an average dose of 1,000 mg per day of the disclosed composition for up to one year. Outcomes studies revealed gene function to improve in all SNPs tested thus suggesting a strong possibility of decreasing the chance of disease expression or decreasing severity of the active disease. All the genes listed in Table 2 (below) confirmed adequate functionality within 12 months to possibly aid in disease prevention or recovery. Table 2 shows the list of genes evaluated and the functionality of the genes before administering the disclosed composition; and after supplementing with the disclosed composition for up to one year, improvement in functionality increased to as much as 93 to 100 percent.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup

L-Carnitine tartrate, fumaric acid, pyridoxal-5&#x2032;-phosphate, and pyridoxine. The disclosed composition was successful in improving functionality in the above listed SNPs and may correct the mutations over time. L-Carnitine tartrate with pyridoxal-5&#x2032;-phosphate, fumaric acid, and pyridoxine improved gene functionality up to 100 percent with no overexpression noted.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">L-Carnitine increases the proliferative responses of both murine and human lymphocyte following mitogenic stimulation and increase polymorphonuclear chemotaxis. L-Carnitine assists with fatty acid transport across the cell membrane and improves mitochondrial function. Furthermore, L-Carnitine, even at minimal concentrations, neutralizes the lipid induced immunosuppression.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) in the disclosed composition can prevent impairment of nucleic acid synthesis and depresses antibody formation, delayed hypersensitivity reactions and the ability of phagocytes to kill bacteria. Thus, the pyridoxine may upregulate the immune system enhancing carnitine function.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Fumaric acid is an acid regulatory thus likely creating a healthier pH in the cell. Much like Vitamin D, fumaric acid is formed by the body, in the skin during exposure to sunlight. It is related to malic acid and is involved in the production of energy derived from food. Fumaric acid is an intermediate product of the citric acid cycle that is a source of intracellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is generated by oxidation of adenylsuccinate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase and is then converted to maleate by the enzyme fumarase. At present, fumaric acid esters (FAE) are licensed for the treatment of psoriasis. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated immunomodulatory effects for FAE. Clinical studies in psoriasis showed a reduction of peripheral CD4+- and CD8+-T-lymphocytes due to the ability of FAE to induce apoptosis. In vitro studies with the ester dimethyl fumarate (DMF) described an inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#x3ba;B)-dependent transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;) induced genes in human endothelial cells. Animal studies using a model of central nervous system demyelination, MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), revealed a reduction of microglia and macrophages in inflamed lesions. A clinical study in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients with a modified fumaric acid ester, BG-12, showed as &#x201c;proof of principle&#x201d; a significant reduction in the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions after 24 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">The disclosed method includes a step of administering the composition through one of the different routes of administration known in the art for administering medicine in humans. Preferably, the composition can be administered through an oral route. The composition can be formulated in oral or liquid forms for oral administration to humans. Examples of the liquid formulation can include suspensions, syrups and like. Examples of solid dosage forms can include tablets and capsules. The formulation may also include other ingredients which are substantially neutral and used for formulating the desired dosage form. Such ingredients are generally referred to as excipients. The disclosed dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of formulating oral dosage forms without departing from the scope of the present invention.
