including a predominately hydrogen gas stream and a predominately methane gas steam. Hydrocarbon gas streams are reformed, cracked, or converted into a synthesis gas stream and methane gas stream by receiving a volume of flare gas or other hydrocarbon liquid or gas feed, where the volume of hydrocarbon feed includes a volume of methane and volume of nonmethane hydrocarbons. The hydrogen contained in the syngas may be separated into a pure hydrogen gas stream. A corresponding gas conversion system can include a super heater to provide a hydrocarbon feed/steam mixture, a heavy hydrocarbon reactor for synthesis gas formation, and a hydrogen separator to recover the hydrogen portion of the synthesis gas.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="83.31mm" wi="158.75mm"

TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oil wells often have an amount of natural gas associated with them (also referred to herein as &#x201c;associated gas&#x201d; and &#x201c;flare gas&#x201d;). Crude oil and natural gas are extracted from the oil wells together, and the natural gas and crude oil must be separated. In remote areas with insufficient infrastructure or where the economics present a challenge, this associated gas may be flared. The flaring process causes carbon dioxide and volatile organic compound emissions and is being targeted for removal for environmental protection reasons. In addition, the flaring process wastes substantial amounts of valuable energy by unproductively burning the associated gas and is attracting increasing scrutiny for such waste.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Natural gas associated with oil wells can be high in alkanes other than methane (C1), such as ethane (C2), propane (C3) and butane (C4). These higher carbon number alkanes are of high caloric value compared to methane and can result in the associated gas having a heating value exceeding the limits for use as a conventional fuel in natural gas engines and other applications. In order to reduce the heating value of the associated gas to a range that is consistent with application specifications, the majority of the C2+ hydrocarbons are often removed producing a methane-rich gas which can be used as a conventional fuel. This gas conditioning process wherein a methane-rich gas is produced results in a by-product stream consisting predominately of the high heating value C2+ hydrocarbons which are generally referred to as natural gas liquids (&#x201c;NGLs&#x201d;) and which are typically unusable as fuel. The by-product NGLs are generally transported off-site for further processing which adds to the cost and complexity of using associated gas as a conventional fuel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The most common remote processing technologies for NGL separation include mechanical refrigeration units (&#x201c;MRU&#x201d;), Joule-Thompson Skids (&#x201c;JT Skid&#x201d;) and membrane systems. Each of these methods separates a portion of the NGLs to provide a useable methane-rich gas, but also yields a typically unusable, high heating value NGL stream which must be collected, stored and ultimately transported off-site for processing, adding to overall costs and complexity. The alternative of converting the entire associated gas stream into a liquid fuel, referred to as gas-to-liquid (&#x201c;GTL&#x201d;), has so far proven to be uneconomic at the scale needed to process associated gas in the field. Both processes are energy intensive and typically require onsite electrical power generation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although these methods address excessive NGL content in associated gas, which often renders the gas unusable as a conventional fuel, they increase the cost and complexity of using associated gas as a fuel due to the added burden of NGL separation, storage and transportation. In cases where the associated gas is used as a conventional fuel, the engine is generally de-rated, yielding a significant loss in performance and efficiency. In addition, using associated gas as fuel can increase emissions and reduce engine life.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods exist for generating hydrogen from hydrocarbon streams, but scale and energy requirements have so far prevented economically viable application of such methods, especially in remote, distributed generation applications. For example, hydrogen gas can be produced using several different processes including thermochemical dissociation of hydrocarbons, electrolysis of water and anaerobic digestion of organic biomass. Hydrogen can be produced in centralized, large scale plants or in distributed, small scale facilities. There are cost tradeoffs between the two approaches with centralized production yielding a reduction in production cost but an increase in distribution cost compared to the opposite for distributed production due largely to lack of scale economies.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The least expensive and most common method for producing hydrogen is steam methane reforming (&#x201c;SMR&#x201d;). This process is complex and energy intensive due to the high temperatures required to dissociate the carbon and hydrogen molecules comprising methane gas and, as such, is only commercially viable in large scale, centralized facilities. Although hydrogen production and use in large integrated facilities is economically viable, the remote use of such hydrogen is too costly to compete with alternative fuel sources owing to hydrogen's high cost of storage and transportation. Water electrolysis is more suitable for distributed production but due to the high energy requirements of the process the hydrogen production cost has so far proved uneconomic.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Steill et al. U.S. Publication No. 2019/0024003 addresses these problems with methods and systems for converting associated gas in which a volume of methane and a volume of other alkanes may be cleaned of the other alkanes using a steam reformer system to create synthesis gas. The disclosed method may then further process the synthesis gas to convert it to a methane rich process gas which may be combined with flare gas to form an enriched product gas with a specific caloric value and methane number.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In various aspects, the disclosure relates to a hydrocarbon (e.g., gas) conversion system for forming one or more of a hydrogen gas stream, a carbon dioxide gas stream, and a product gas stream from a hydrocarbon (e.g., gas) feed stream comprising non-methane hydrocarbons and optionally methane. As used herein, reference to a hydrocarbon gas feed stream and a gas conversion system can more generically apply to, or otherwise be used interchangeably with, a hydrocarbon feed and a hydrocarbon conversion system, respectively, for example when processing vaporized liquid hydrocarbons as components of the system feed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an aspect, the disclosure relates to a hydrocarbon conversion system for converting a hydrocarbon gas feed (or hydrocarbon feed) stream comprising non-methane hydrocarbons and optionally methane to form at least one of (i) a hydrogen gas stream and (ii) a product gas stream comprising methane. The hydrocarbon conversion system can be a modular system, for example comprising heavy hydrocarbon reforming (HHR) module alone or in combination with one or more other modules or unit operations such as a carbon dioxide separator or module, a synthetic natural gas (SNG) module, hydrogen separator or separator module, and/or a methane separator or separator module. Using a modular design, the HHR module is flexible in that it can provide a platform gas output with a targeted, selectable distribution between primary hydrogen and methane components using a single, consistent set of unit operations by adjusting the operating conditions thereof. The flexibility of the HHR module platform gas output allows selection of further downstream unit operation modules to provide fuel product outputs corresponding specifically to a given user's needs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The heavy hydrocarbon reforming (HHR) module comprises: a first inlet for receiving the hydrocarbon gas feed stream; a second inlet for receiving system water (e.g., recycled from a downstream SNG module, make-up water, or fresh water for initial charge); optionally a third inlet for receiving system water (e.g., makeup or fresh water only, where the second inlet is then used for recycled downstream water only); and a first outlet for delivering a platform gas comprising methane and hydrogen (e.g., and carbon oxides, but substantially reduced water (e.g., about 2 mol. % or less). The platform gas can be the product gas when there are no further downstream modules. Alternatively, the platform gas can be an intermediate gas fed to one or more further downstream modules for separation and/or reaction. The HHR module further comprises a steam generator adapted to (i) receive system water and (ii) output steam; and a super heater (or process heater) adapted to (i) receive a feed gas comprising in admixture the hydrocarbon gas feed stream from the first inlet and the steam from the steam generator and (ii) superheat the feed gas to a predetermined temperature range to form a superheated feed gas. The HHR module further comprises a first reactor (or HHR reactor) containing a first catalyst (e.g., a catalyst fill comprising at least one catalyst, two or more catalysts, layers of different catalysts) and being adapted to receive the superheated feed gas from the super heater in fluid communication with the first reactor. The first reactor and the first catalyst are adapted to react at least a portion of the non-methane hydrocarbons in the superheated feed gas into carbon oxides, hydrogen, methane, and water, thereby forming a first reformate comprising the carbon oxides, the hydrogen, the methane, and water (e.g., a wet first reformate). In the first (HHR) reactor, typically substantially all non-methane hydrocarbons are reacted or reacted at least close to equilibrium conversion of the combined steam reformation and methanation reactions, such as at least 95, 98, 99, or 99.5 mol. % conversion of non-methane hydrocarbons present in the feed. The HHR module further comprises a cooler (or water separator/separation system more generally) adapted to (i) receive the first reformate from the first reactor in fluid communication with the cooler, and (ii) separate at least a portion of the water from the first reformate, thereby providing (i) a dried first reformate (e.g., about 2 mol. % water or) in fluid communication with the first outlet as the platform gas and (ii) a recycled system water stream in fluid communication with the steam generator (e.g., boiler component thereof) and the second inlet. The HHR module is adapted to receive additional recycled system water or water from other sources in various modular embodiments for combination with the recycled system water stream returned to the steam generator.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a refinement of the modular system design, the HHR module is free from at least one of methane separators, hydrogen separators, carbon dioxide separators, and synthetic natural gas (SNG) reactors. In view of the modular design of the hydrocarbon conversion system, the HHR module is generally not designed to perform some or all of typical operations associated with methane separation, hydrogen separation, carbon dioxide separation, and/or SNG production, such operations generally being performed upstream or downstream of the HHR module, depending on a particular user's desired final product(s) of the hydrocarbon conversion system. The HHR module being free from such operations (e.g., free from corresponding unit operation apparatus) can be expressed as the HHR module (or hydrocarbon conversion system more generally) not containing one or more of methane separators, hydrogen separators, carbon dioxide separators, and/or SNG reactors upstream of the first outlet, downstream of the first inlet, and/or downstream of the second inlet. Even in such cases where the HHR module is free from various separators and/or SNG reactors, the HHR module can include multiple reactors for forming multiple reformate streams to increase production capacity, for example including multiple HHRs in parallel to form multiple reformate streams in parallel. Such multiple reformate streams could remain in parallel streams, consolidated into fewer streams or a single stream, etc. for subsequent cooling and water removal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a refinement of the modular system design, the hydrocarbon conversion system is free from further separation or reaction apparatus downstream of the HHR module first outlet; and the platform gas is the product gas stream. In some embodiments, the platform gas can be used as the final fuel product of the hydrocarbon conversion system, for example for use as a hydrogen-rich turbine fuel. In such cases, the platform gas can be used as is, or it can be blended with other fuel components (such as C1 hydrocarbons or a mixture of hydrocarbons containing primarily C1 and C2, for example pipeline methane or otherwise a predominantly methane stream), but it need not be subjected to further separation and/or reaction steps or unit operations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a refinement of the modular system design, the hydrocarbon conversion system further comprises a carbon dioxide separator or module in fluid communication with the first outlet of the HHR module and adapted to (i) receive the platform gas from the HHR module and (ii) separate at least a portion of carbon dioxide present in the platform gas, thereby providing (i) a carbon dioxide stream and (ii) the product gas stream comprising the methane and the hydrogen from the platform gas (e.g., with reduced or substantially no carbon dioxide therein). In some embodiments, some or substantially all of the carbon dioxide in the platform gas can be removed to provide a blue hydrogen-rich turbine fuel, which, similar to raw platform gas above, can be blended with other fuel components such as C1 hydrocarbons or a mixture of hydrocarbons containing primarily C1 and C2, for example pipeline methane or otherwise a predominantly methane stream. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon conversion system can incorporate a carbon dioxide separator module including the carbon dioxide separator along with an integrated recuperative heating element, for example to heat the amine in an amine separator or other process fluid in the carbon dioxide separator using process heat from one or more other modules. For example, a hot-oil heating system can be heated by the SNG reactor outlet and/or steam from the vaporizer to thereby provide heat to the carbon dioxide separator.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a refinement of the modular system design, the hydrocarbon conversion system further comprises a synthetic natural gas (SNG) module. In an embodiment, the SNG module comprises: a first inlet for receiving an SNG feed stream comprising hydrogen, carbon oxides, and optionally methane (e.g., substantially reduced or limited water in the feed), the first inlet of the SNG module being in fluid communication with the first outlet of the HHR module (e.g., downstream thereof to (directly) receive the platform gas therefrom as the feed to the SNG module); a first outlet for delivering the product gas stream comprising the methane (e.g., at a higher methane content than that of the SNG feed stream); and a second outlet for delivering the recycled system water, the second outlet of the SNG module being in fluid communication with the second inlet of the HHR module (e.g., upstream thereof to provide additional water to the recycled water stream in the HHR module).

In such cases, the HHR module can be operated at relatively lower temperatures to provide a platform gas with a relatively higher fraction of methane, for example relative to the platform gas as a whole or relative to the combined amount of methane and hydrogen in the platform gas.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other embodiments, the HHR module's fluid communication with the SNG module can be indirectly downstream of the HHR module, for example having at least one other intervening separator operation therebetween (e.g., a carbon dioxide separator and a hydrogen separator in series between the HHR module and the SNG module). This can be the case, for example, when hydrogen is the primary product of the overall hydrocarbon conversion system. In such cases, the HHR module can be operated at relatively higher temperatures to provide a platform gas with a relatively higher fraction of hydrogen, for example relative to the platform gas as a whole or relative to the combined amount of methane and hydrogen in the platform gas.

For example, the steam:carbon ratio can have a value of about 2.3 to promote methane production, such as at least 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 and/or up to 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6. Alternatively, the steam:carbon ratio can have a value of about 4 or higher to promote hydrogen production, such as at least 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6 and/or up to 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, or 8. The steam:carbon ratio is a molar ratio between the moles of water and moles of carbon atoms in the feed gas (e.g., 1 mol of ethane in the feed gas provides 2 mol of carbon atoms for determination of the steam:carbon ratio). The first reactor of the HHR module can operate over a wide range of temperatures, for example in a range of about 400-800&#xb0; C.

Similar conditions apply to the second reactor when operating in an HHR mode, in an SNG mode, or in an SNG module.

The hydrocarbon conversion system preferably includes all three of the first, second, and third heat exchangers as HHR recuperative heat exchangers to recover heat energy from the HHR/first reactor outlet.

The portion of the system water fed to the vaporizer can include fresh/makeup water and/or recycled system water from the cooler. The vaporizer can be positioned downstream of the third heat exchanger and can include a flow-split between a return to the steam generator and the vaporizer heat exchanger.

This embodiment also can represent an upgradable version of the HHR module that does not contain the vaporizer, but which is pre-plumbed with the water lines to facilitate later installation and connection of the vaporizer to the water lines as the cold side fluid.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The vaporizer provides the benefit that the first reformate is cooled to a relatively lower temperature such that subsequent downstream unit operations in the HHR module or the hydrocarbon or gas conversion system more generally, for example the first, second, and third heat exchangers, are not exposed to high extreme temperatures, thus lessening their cost while still providing the recuperative energy benefits of preheating the water, hydrocarbon feed, and feed gas streams. Such high first reformate temperatures immediately out of the first reactor are possible when the first reactor is operated to favor hydrogen gas as a product component in the platform gas. The vaporizer also provides steam output for various process uses, for example as a reactant for the first reactor, and the steam demand for the first reactor is typically higher when the first reactor is operated to favor hydrogen gas as a product in the platform gas (i.e., which also corresponds to the higher first (HHR) reactor outlet temperature and need for temperature reduction). Vaporizer steam output can be used in other process elements, for example in the carbon dioxide separator (e.g., amine separator). In embodiments when the first reactor is operated to favor methane as a product in the platform gas, the first reformate temperatures immediately out of the first reactor are typically lower in comparison as is the steam demand for the first reactor. In such cases, a relatively smaller fraction (or none) of the system water can be delivered to the vaporizer heat exchanger, with the balance being delivered to the steam generator (e.g., boiler thereof). Thus, the vaporizer facilitates the modular design of the HHR module and its ability to operate in both high- and low-temperature regimes to make platform gas products favoring either hydrogen or methane components: Selection of a variable partition between system water fed back to the steam generator boiler vs. that fed to the vaporizer allows a variable, selectable degree of temperature reduction for the wet reformate and steam generation that is appropriate for the hydrogen or methane favored platform gas component.

The first reactor and the second reactor are in parallel such that each is in fluid communication with and adapted to receive a portion of the superheated feed gas (e.g., via a suitable flow splitter upstream of the reactors and downstream of the super heater).

Temperature increase-/decrease-controlled operation of a reactor can include a moderate temperature increase or decrease from inlet to outlet for reactant/product streams, respectively, for example having a temperature difference (&#x394;T, outlet minus inlet) of at least 75, 100, 125, or 150&#xb0; C. and/or up to about 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, or 300&#xb0; C. for a controlled temperature increase, or at least &#x2212;125, &#x2212;150, &#x2212;175, &#x2212;200, &#x2212;250, or &#x2212;300&#xb0; C. and/or up to &#x2212;75, &#x2212;100, &#x2212;125, or &#x2212;150&#xb0; C. for a controlled temperature decrease.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a refinement, the first reactor (e.g., and second reactor if present) is adapted to receive a countercurrent, (hot) heat exchange fluid, thereby providing heat to a reaction volume in the first reactor containing the first catalyst and the superheated feed gas.

For example, one or both of the reactors are operating in an HHR mode for hydrogen gas generation as an eventual product, the reactors are suitably operated as isothermal reactors or temperature increase-/decrease-controlled reactors. More specifically, for hydrogen production the HHR(s) can be operated isothermally or with controlled temperature increase or decrease by utilizing counter-current flow heat exchange streams for heating the reactor at both ends. The initial feed is preheated using the superheater and counter flow with heating fluid (hot gas) is used to introduce heat at the exit and prevent temperature drop across the reactor catalyst bed from entrance to exit. When one reactor is operating in an HHR mode and another reactor is operating in SNG mode in a modal system design for methane gas generation as an eventual product, the HHR reactor can be operated adiabatically using parallel/co-current heating fluid flow. The SNG reactor operates more as isothermal to maintain the reaction temperature within a reasonable range by using counter flow&#x2014;in this case with a cooling fluid (e.g., ambient air from blowers)&#x2014;to cool the reactor given that methanation is an exothermic reaction.

The methane separator (or NGL separator) can be any suitable separator to separate methane from other natural gas liquids (NGLs) from a flare gas/associated gas stream including both methane and non-methane hydrocarbons. Suitable examples include Joule-Thompson (JT) separators, mechanical refrigeration separators, membrane separators, etc. and can generally include separators known in the art.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Prior to being fed to the methane separator, the hydrocarbon conversion system, or the HHR module, the flare gas/associated gas stream can be first split into (i) a bypass/enrichment stream for blending with the product gas stream (i.e., bypassing the entire system of hydrogen formation and separation) and (ii) a feed stream containing both methane and non-methane hydrocarbons for hydrogen formation and separation. The methane separator can be a multistage device. As shown in the figures, the methane separator can include a first NGL separation stage to remove methane as a gas (e.g., along with lesser amounts of lower C2+ hydrocarbons), and have a second output of primarily C2+ hydrocarbons with some residual methane. The separated predominately methane gas stream is used as a second bypass/enrichment stream, whereas the liquid output from the NGL separation is passed to an NGL run tank in which the lighter hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, etc.) will begin to vaporize before or in the NGL run tank and must be vented to avoid a pressure rise in the tank. Thus, the gas output from the NGL run tank includes a third bypass/enrichment stream including methane and minor amount of lower C2+ hydrocarbons, and the liquid output from the NGL run tank includes primarily C2+ hydrocarbons, but with less methane. The splitting into bypass/enrichment and feed streams can be performed independently of whether the methane separator is used. Suitably, up to three blending/enrichment stages can be used: (1) The initial process gas stream can be blended with the NGL run tank vented gas to form the initial product gas stream. (2) The initial product gas stream can be blended with the light gas (predominately methane) from the methane (e.g., JT) separation to form a second product gas stream.

For example, the hydrocarbon gas feed stream can be a result of upstream methane separation providing a feed gas with less than 20 mol. % (or vol. %) methane, with the C2+ hydrocarbons being substantially the balance of the feed.

Accordingly, in some embodiments and depending on the pressure of the incoming feed to the hydrogen separator, it can be desirable to include a compressor to increase the pressure of an incoming low-pressure feed (e.g., in a range of about 20-50 psi or 30-35 psi) up to the desired elevated pressure. In other embodiments, for example where the incoming hydrocarbon feed gas to the system is compressed to the elevated pressures, a compressor prior to the hydrogen separator can be omitted. Suitably, the system also includes a carbon dioxide separator as illustrated in the figures, for example an amine or other standalone apparatus separate from the hydrogen separator. Thus, the hydrogen separator can provide up to three outlets: a hydrogen gas stream, a carbon dioxide stream, and a residual product stream (e.g., including residual hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and non-methane hydrocarbons, etc.).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Carbon dioxide removal allows the gas conversion system the flexibility to provide product streams based on desired end uses. For example, carbon dioxide removal can be used in order to provide the produced hydrogen gas as &#x201c;Blue&#x201d; hydrogen, which increases the market value of the product. As background, there are three types/grades of hydrogen produced: 1) Grey hydrogen (produced from reformation without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS); Blue hydrogen (produced from hydrocarbons like reformation but with CCS); and 3) Green hydrogen (produced completely from renewable resources (typically electrolysis with energy provided via wind, solar or nuclear). Carbon dioxide removal (e.g., via CCS) can provide a green benefit and produce another source of revenue from sale and/or carbon/renewable energy credits. Carbon dioxide removal or separation can be performed by any suitable apparatus or combination of apparatus, for example a membrane separator and/or a scrubber. In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide separator is a full amine plant system (e.g., amine-based scrubber), for example including an amine contacting tower and amine recovery loop. Carbon monoxide is typically not removed from process streams; carbon monoxide can remain in a product gas and be consumed/combusted for its fuel value, or it can be converted to methane as a reactant in an SNG reactor or module. After carbon dioxide removal, the product gas or intermediate product gas can contain methane in a range of 10-90 mol. % (e.g., at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 mol. % and/or up to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 mol. %), hydrogen in a range of 10-90 mol. % (e.g., at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 mol. % and/or up to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90 mol. %), carbon monoxide in a range of 0.01-10 mol. % (e.g., at least 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 mol. % and/or up to 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 mol. %), water in a range of 0.01-5 mol. % (e.g., at least 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 mol. % and/or up to 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 5 mol. %), and/or less than 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001 mol. % carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Selection and control of hydrogen, methane, and/or carbon dioxide content of the product streams also allows the gas conversion system the flexibility to provide fuel streams according to a user-specific set of criteria (e.g., a &#x201c;designer&#x201d; fuel). System capacity and production can be autonomously and independently varied among the primary hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide products such that one or more gas streams with desired hydrogen, methane, and/or carbon dioxide contents can be produced based on user demand. The gas conversion system permits removal of product streams and/or addition of product streams to produce a fuel tailored to specific applications, providing optimum fuel parameters for reciprocating and turbine engine performance. For example, reciprocating and turbine engine manufacturers consider fuel diluent (carbon dioxide) and hydrogen (H2) content as highly beneficial additions to a methane-based fuel. Specifically: 1) the system can adjust the diluent content (carbon dioxide) of a methane-based fuel to target values consistent with lower engine emissions and better engine performance and longer life, 2) the system can adjust the hydrogen content in a methane-based fuel to provide performance, life, and emissions benefits to engine/turbine performance, and 3) the system can control other parameters like heating value, C2+ content, Wobbe Index, etc. to benefit performance, life, and emissions. In another mode of operation, the system is used a hydrogen-production (e.g., HHR/HHR) configuration for the production of designer fuels only such that the hydrogen gas is not separated into a final, substantially pure hydrogen gas product, but instead included as a fuel component. For example, there may be applications where removing hydrogen gas is not desired and production of a tailored methane-based fuel is desired.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another aspect, the disclosure relates to a method for forming at least one of (i) a hydrogen gas stream and (ii) a product gas stream from a hydrocarbon gas feed stream comprising non-methane hydrocarbons and optionally methane, the method comprising: feeding the hydrocarbon gas feed stream to a hydrocarbon or gas conversion system according to any of the foregoing embodiments, thereby forming at least one of (i) a hydrogen gas stream and (ii) a product gas stream, for example with the various intermediate steps of heating, cooling, mixing, reacting, separating, etc. For example, a modular hydrocarbon or gas conversion system as described herein can be used to form one or both of a hydrogen gas stream and a product gas stream comprising methane (e.g., synthetic natural gas, tail gas, designer fuel). The method can optionally include adding an additional product stream (e.g., carbon dioxide, synthetic natural gas, and/or tail gas from the modular system or otherwise) to at least one of the hydrogen gas stream and the product gas stream, thereby forming a designer fuel stream having a selected composition. Further, hydrogen gas can be formed using a gas conversion system as described above with one, two, or more HHR units. Similarly, a modal gas conversion system as described above can be used to form hydrogen gas, methane, or both (i.e., when switching between modes) with at least one HHR unit and at least lone HHR/SNG

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The disclosure generally relates to methods, systems, and apparatus to produce a hydrogen gas stream (e.g., a substantially pure hydrogen gas stream), a carbon dioxide gas stream (e.g., a substantially pure carbon dioxide gas stream), and a high quality, methane rich gas stream from flare gas or other hydrocarbon feed gas streams. Hydrocarbon feed gas streams are reformed, cracked, or converted into a syngas stream and methane gas stream by receiving a volume of hydrocarbon feed gas, where the volume of hydrocarbon feed gas includes a volume of methane (C1) and a volume of non-methane (C2+) hydrocarbons. The method can control both an inlet flow of the volume of hydrocarbon feed gas and a volume of steam to at least one reformer system that will reform, crack, or convert at least a portion of the volume of C2+ hydrocarbons (e.g., with or without methane present). In this way, the steam reformer system(s) generates a volume of syngas and a volume of methane gas from the volume of hydrocarbon feed gas and the volume of steam. The hydrogen contained in the syngas may be separated into a high purity hydrogen gas stream by various technologies including membrane separation and pressure swing adsorption (&#x201c;PSA&#x201d;) systems leaving a residual, predominately methane and carbon oxide gas stream. The separated hydrogen or the residual predominately methane and carbon oxide stream may be combined with the hydrocarbon feed gas to form an enriched product gas with targeted quality values including heating value, methane number or Wobbe index. In this way, the hydrogen gas and the residual predominately methane and carbon oxide gas is made available for use on-site as a fuel or for compression or liquefaction and storage or transportation off-site.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The disclosure further relates to methods, systems, and apparatus to produce a hydrogen gas stream (e.g., a substantially pure hydrogen gas stream) and a high quality, methane rich gas stream from flare gas or other hydrocarbon feed gases by receiving a volume of the hydrocarbon feed gas, where the volume of hydrocarbon feed gas includes a volume of methane (C1) and a volume of C2+ hydrocarbons. The method separates the hydrocarbon feed gas into a predominately methane gas stream and a predominately C2+ hydrocarbon gas stream using various gas separation technologies including Joule-Thompson, mechanical refrigeration and membrane systems. The method can control both an inlet flow of the volume of C2+ hydrocarbons and a volume of steam to at least one reformer system that will reform, crack, or convert at least a portion of the volume of the predominately C2+ hydrocarbons. In this way, the steam reformer system(s) generates a volume of syngas and a volume of methane gas from the volume of predominately C2+ hydrocarbons and the volume of steam. The method may then further separate the hydrogen gas contained in the syngas into a separate high purity hydrogen gas stream by any of various technologies including membrane and pressure swing adsorption (&#x201c;PSA&#x201d;) systems leaving a residual, predominately methane and carbon oxide gas stream. The separated hydrogen or the predominately methane and carbon oxide stream may be combined with the predominately methane gas separated from the hydrocarbon feed gas and/or with the hydrocarbon feed gas to produce an enriched product gas with targeted gas quality values including specific heating value, methane number or Wobbe index. In this way, the hydrogen gas and the predominately methane and carbon oxide gas is made available for use on-site as a fuel or for compression or liquefaction and transportation off-site.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a particular aspect, the disclosure relates to modular systems, methods, and apparatus to produce one or both of (i) a hydrogen gas stream (e.g., a substantially pure hydrogen gas stream), and (ii) a methane-containing product stream (such as methane rich gas stream or a methane/hydrogen blend) from non-methane hydrocarbon feed gas streams. The modular systems allow flexible fuel production ranging from fuel cell grade hydrogen to pipeline quality methane to site-specific &#x201c;designer fuel&#x201d; blend containing methane, hydrogen, and (optionally) carbon dioxide according to a given user's specifications. The modular design allows quick configuration and onsite installation and assembly of a system tailored to a specific user's needs. Using a modular design, an HHR module as the core component is flexible in that it can provide a platform gas output with a targeted, selectable distribution between primary hydrogen and methane components using a single, consistent installed/assembled set of unit operations. By varying operating conditions such as steam:carbon ratio and HHR reactor temperature, relative conversion and selectivity of steam reformation and methanation reactions in the HHR reactor can be controlled within wide ranges such the composition of the platform gas can include a relatively higher fraction of hydrogen product (e.g., compared to methane) when hydrogen is the ultimate desired product, the platform gas can include a relatively higher fraction of methane product (e.g., compared to hydrogen) when methane is the ultimate desired product, the platform gas can include a balanced blend of hydrogen and methane when both are desired ultimate products, etc. This flexibility of the HHR module platform gas output, which is obtainable using a single installed arrangement of unit operations in the HHR module, allows selection of further downstream unit operation modules to provide fuel product outputs corresponding specifically to a given user's needs. Such downstream modules can include those directed to carbon dioxide separation, hydrogen separation, and/or SNG production.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Another embodiment of the disclosure relates to methods, systems, and apparatus to produce a high purity hydrogen gas stream and a methane rich gas stream from flare gas or other hydrocarbon feed gases, as described above, wherein the syngas is further processed in a water gas shift reactor to increase the hydrogen content prior to its separation by membrane, PSA or other technologies.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Another embodiment of the disclosure relates to methods, systems, and apparatus to produce a high purity hydrogen gas stream and a methane rich gas stream from C2+ hydrocarbons wherein the system feed gas does not include methane gas.

The feed gas <b>132</b> is then fed to a super heater <b>140</b>, which superheats the feed gas <b>132</b> to a selected temperature and outputs a superheated feed gas <b>142</b>. The superheated feed gas <b>142</b> is then fed to a first HHR reactor <b>150</b>, which contains a catalyst adapted to react at least a portion of non-methane hydrocarbons in the superheated feed gas <b>142</b> into carbon oxides and hydrogen, thereby forming a reformate <b>152</b> including carbon oxides, hydrogen, and optionally methane.

The reformate streams <b>152</b> exiting the HHR reactors <b>150</b> can be passed through a cooler <b>160</b> to remove water <b>169</b>, which can be recycled, for example to the steam generator <b>120</b>.
