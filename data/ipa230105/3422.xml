Heat sources operating at temperatures above the surrounding environment can be naturally cooled by the surrounding if there is direct contact between the source and the environment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional refrigeration systems include a compressor, a heat rejection heat exchanger (i.e., a condenser), a receiver, an expansion device, and a heat absorption exchanger (i.e., an evaporator). Such systems can be used to maintain operating temperature set points for a wide variety of cooled heat sources (loads, processes, equipment, systems) thermally interacting with the evaporator. Closed-circuit refrigeration systems may pump significant amounts of absorbed thermal energy from heat sources into the surrounding environment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In closed-circuit systems, compressors are used to compress vapor from an evaporating pressure the evaporator and to a condensing pressure in the condensers and condense the compressed vapor converting the vapor into a liquid at a temperature higher than the surrounding environment temperature. The combination of condensers and compressors can add a significant amount of weight and can consume relatively large amounts of electrical power. In general, the larger the amount of absorbed thermal energy that the system is designed to handle, the heavier the refrigeration system and the larger the amount of power consumed during operation, even when cooling of a heat source occurs over relatively short time periods.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some cases the surrounding environment temperature can appear below the heat source temperature. The refrigeration system provides a contact via refrigerant. There may be no need to compress vapor from the evaporating to condensing pressure since condensation can happen at a pressure slightly higher or even below the evaporating pressure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This disclosure features a thermal management system (TMS) that, in some implementations, enables direct cooling of a phase change material (PCM) in a thermal energy storage (TES), as well as one or more devices being cooled by the TES.

On one hand, such loads generate significant quantities of heat that is extracted during cooling. In conventional closed-cycle refrigeration systems, cooling high heat loads typically involves circulating refrigerant fluid at a relatively high mass flow rate. However, closed-cycle system components that are used for refrigerant fluid circulation&#x2014;including compressors and condensers&#x2014;are typically heavy and consume significant power. As a result, many closed-cycle systems are not well suited for deployment in mobile platforms&#x2014;such as on small vehicles&#x2014;where size and weight constraints may make the use of large compressors and condensers impractical.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Temperature sensitive loads such as electronic components and devices may require temperature regulation within a relatively narrow range of operating temperatures. Maintaining the temperature of such a load to within a small tolerance of a temperature set point can be challenging when a single-phase refrigerant fluid is used for heat extraction, since the refrigerant fluid itself will increase in temperature as heat is absorbed from the load.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Directed energy systems that are mounted to mobile vehicles such as trucks may present many of the foregoing operating challenges, as such systems may include high heat, temperature sensitive components that require precise cooling during operation in a relatively short time. The thermal management systems disclosed herein, while generally applicable to the cooling of a wide variety of thermal loads, are particularly well suited for operation with such directed energy systems.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In particular, the thermal management systems and methods disclosed herein include a number of features that reduce both overall size and weight relative to conventional refrigeration systems, and still extract excess heat energy from both high heat, highly temperature sensitive components and relatively temperature insensitive components, to accurately match temperature set points for the components. At the same time, the disclosed thermal management systems require no significant power to sustain their operation. Whereas certain conventional refrigeration systems used closed-circuit refrigerant flow paths, the systems and methods disclosed herein use open-cycle refrigerant flow paths. Depending upon the nature of the refrigerant fluid, exhaust refrigerant fluid may be incinerated as fuel, chemically treated, and/or simply discharged at the end of the flow path.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, &#x201c;refrigeration&#x201d; as used in the present disclosure can mean a system (or multiple systems fluidly coupled) that operates to generate a purposeful change of a characteristic of a coolant (e.g., a refrigerant fluid) to effectuate or increase heat transfer between two mediums (one of which can be the coolant). The purposeful change of the characteristic can be, for example, a change in pressure (e.g., depressurization) of a pressurized coolant though an expansion valve. In some embodiments, the change in pressure can include a phase change of the coolant, such as a liquid-to-gas phase change (e.g., endothermic vaporization). In some embodiments, pressurization of the refrigerant can be performed by a powered (e.g., electrically or otherwise) component, such as (but not limited to) a compressor. In some embodiments, pressurization can be performed as part of the refrigeration cycle (e.g., a closed-cycle refrigeration process in which gaseous refrigerant is substantially or completely recycled and compressed into a liquid state) or prior to use (e.g., storing pre-compressed liquid refrigerant for later use in an open-cycle refrigeration process in which a reserve of liquid refrigerant is used but substantially not recycled). In some embodiments, the phase change can be driven by heating a liquid refrigerant with a very low boiling point (e.g., ammonia as used in an absorption-type refrigeration cycle).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of a thermal management system (TMS) <b>100</b> is shown to include a vapor cycle system (VCS) <b>12</b> and a liquid pumping system (LPS) <b>14</b> that are arranged in a closed-circuit refrigeration system (CCRS) <b>10</b>. The VCS <b>12</b> includes a receiver <b>110</b> having inlet <b>109</b> and an outlet <b>111</b>, an optional solenoid valve <b>112</b> having an inlet <b>113</b> and outlet <b>115</b>, an optional flow control device <b>114</b> (e.g., an optional expansion valve <b>114</b>) having an inlet <b>117</b> and outlet <b>119</b>, an evaporator <b>116</b> (with example configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>) having an inlet <b>121</b> and outlet <b>123</b>, a thermal energy storage (TES) <b>128</b> having an inlet <b>139</b> and outlet <b>141</b>, a liquid separator <b>124</b>, a compressor <b>104</b> having an inlet <b>101</b> and outlet <b>103</b>, and a condenser <b>106</b>, coupled in a vapor compression path. The TES <b>128</b> contains a phase change material (PCM) <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The LPS <b>14</b> includes a pump <b>132</b> having an inlet <b>131</b> and outlet <b>133</b>, the evaporator <b>116</b>, the TES <b>128</b>, and the liquid separator <b>124</b> coupled in a liquid pumping path. The liquid separator <b>124</b> includes an inlet <b>125</b>, a vapor-side outlet <b>127</b>, and a liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>, as well as a vapor section <b>142</b> and a liquid section <b>144</b>. A thermal load, i.e., a low heat load <b>120</b> (e.g., relatively low heat load over relatively long-time intervals) is in thermal conductive and/or convective contact or in proximity to evaporator <b>116</b>. The portions of the LPS <b>14</b> and VCS <b>12</b> are coupled, via conduit and a junction <b>138</b>, as shown.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some aspects, the pump <b>132</b> is located distal from the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>. This configuration potentially presents the possibility of cavitation. In another example, the pump <b>132</b> is located distal from the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>, but the inlet <b>125</b> has a sensor to sense when a column of liquid in the liquid separator <b>124</b> reaches a certain height. This configuration potentially minimizes the possibility of cavitation. To further minimize the possibility of cavitation, the pump <b>132</b> can be located close to the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>, and a height at which the inlet <b>125</b> is located is relatively high in the liquid separator <b>124</b>. This would result in an increase in liquid pressure at the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>, and concomitant therewith an increase in liquid pressure at the inlet of the pump <b>132</b>. Increasing the pressure at the inlet to the pump <b>132</b> should minimize any possibility of cavitation. Another strategy can be to locate the pump <b>132</b> proximate to or indeed inside of the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b>. In addition, the height at which the inlet <b>125</b> is located can be relatively high as noted. This would result in an increase in liquid pressure at the inlet of the pump <b>132</b> further minimizing the possibility of cavitation. Any of the modifications described can use a sensor that produces a signal that is a measure of the height of a column of liquid in the liquid separator <b>124</b>. The signal is sent to the control system <b>999</b> that will be used to start the pump <b>132</b> once a sufficient height of liquid is contained by the liquid separator <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The receiver <b>110</b> stores refrigerant fluid <b>1</b>, e.g., a refrigerant liquid or mixed-phase fluid. Receiver <b>110</b> includes inlet <b>109</b>, outlet <b>111</b>, and, in some aspects, a pressure relief valve. To charge receiver <b>110</b>, refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> is typically introduced into receiver <b>110</b> via inlet <b>109</b>, and this can be done, for example, at service locations. Operating in the field, the refrigerant exits receiver <b>110</b> through outlet <b>111</b>. In case of emergency, if the pressure within receiver <b>110</b> exceeds a pressure limit value, a pressure relief valve opens to allow a portion of the refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> to escape through the valve to reduce the pressure within receiver <b>110</b>. Receiver <b>110</b> can also include insulation (not shown) applied around the receiver. In general, receiver <b>110</b> can have a variety of different shapes. In some embodiments, for example, the receiver <b>110</b> is cylindrical. Examples of other possible shapes include, but are not limited to, rectangular prismatic, cubic, and conical. In certain embodiments, receiver <b>110</b> can be oriented such that outlet <b>111</b> is positioned at the bottom of the receiver <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The expansion valve <b>114</b> functions as a flow control device in some aspects. In general, expansion valve <b>114</b> can be implemented as any one or more of a variety of different mechanical and/or electronic devices. For example, in some embodiments, expansion valve <b>114</b> can be implemented as a fixed orifice, a capillary tube, and/or a mechanical or electronic expansion valve. In general, fixed orifices and capillary tubes are passive flow restriction elements which do not actively regulate refrigerant fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Typical electrical expansion valves include an orifice, a moving seat, a motor or actuator that changes the position of the seat with respect to the orifice, a control system <b>999</b> (an example implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), and pressure and temperature sensors at the evaporator exit. The control system <b>999</b> calculates the superheat for the expanded refrigerant fluid based on pressure and temperature measurements at the evaporator exit. If the superheat is above a set-point value, the seat moves to increase the cross-sectional area and the refrigerant fluid volume and mass flow rates to match the superheat set-point value. If the superheat is below the set-point value, the seat moves to decrease the cross-sectional area and the refrigerant fluid flow rates. Mechanical expansion valves (usually called thermostatic or thermal expansion valves) are typically flow control devices that enthalpically expand a refrigerant fluid from a first pressure to an evaporating pressure, controlling the superheat at the evaporator exit. Mechanical expansion valves generally include an orifice, a moving seat that changes the cross-sectional area of the orifice and the refrigerant fluid volume and mass flow rates, a diaphragm moving the seat, and a bulb at the evaporator exit. The bulb is charged with a fluid and it hermetically fluidly communicates with a chamber above the diaphragm. The bulb senses the refrigerant fluid temperature at the evaporator exit (or another location) and the pressure of the fluid inside the bulb, transfers the pressure in the bulb through the chamber to the diaphragm, and moves the diaphragm and the seat to close or to open the orifice. Examples of suitable commercially available expansion devices that can function as expansion valves include, but are not limited to, thermostatic expansion valves available from the Sporlan Division of Parker Hannifin Corporation (Washington, Mo.) and from Danfoss (Syddanmark, Denmark).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The control system <b>999</b> calculates the superheat for the expanded refrigerant fluid based on pressure and temperature measurements at the evaporator exit. If the superheat is above a set-point value, the seat moves to increase the cross-sectional area and the refrigerant fluid volume and mass flow rates to match the superheat set-point value. If the superheat is below the set-point value the seat moves to decrease the cross-sectional area and the refrigerant fluid flow rates. The control system <b>999</b> may be configured to control vapor quality at the evaporator exit as disclosed below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some implementations of the CCRS <b>10</b> (and other example implementations of a CCRS according to the present disclosure, oil is used for lubrication of the compressor <b>104</b> and the oil travels with the refrigerant in the CCRS <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the liquid separator <b>124</b> liquid-side outlet <b>129</b> can be used for oil recovery. The oil is removed from the refrigerant at the liquid-side outlet <b>129</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b>, and is recirculated back to the compressor <b>104</b> inlet, via opening a valve (e.g., a solenoid valve <b>150</b>) and closing an orifice <b>152</b> to return oil from the liquid-side outlet of the liquid separator <b>124</b> to the compressor <b>104</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the CCRS <b>10</b> may include an oil separator OS (as shown). As shown, the OS is disposed in an oil return path (denoted by a dashed line). Similar oil recovery arrangements can be provided for the other embodiments disclosed herein, even if not expressly shown.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The condenser <b>106</b> can operate as a condenser in subcritical VCS operation and as a gas cooler in transcritical VCS operation (with the term &#x201c;condenser&#x201d; used herein for both types of heat rejection heat exchangers). A fan <b>108</b> (or pump <b>108</b>) circulates an airflow <b>126</b> (or water flow <b>126</b> as appropriate) through the condenser <b>106</b> to cool the refrigerant fluid circulating in the condenser <b>106</b> between the inlet <b>105</b> and the outlet <b>107</b>. In some aspects, subcritical refrigeration includes four specific processes: evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion. Subcritical system refrigeration has all of these processes occurring below the refrigerant fluid critical temperature. On the other hand, in some aspects, transcritical refrigeration is a process in which at least a portion of the refrigeration cycle occurs at pressures that are above the critical pressure of the refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> and other parts of the transcritical refrigeration cycle occur at pressures that are below the critical pressure.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Evaporator <b>116</b> can be implemented in a variety of ways. In general, evaporator <b>116</b> functions as a heat absorption exchanger, providing thermal contact between the refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> and heat loads <b>120</b>, <b>118</b> (described later), or other heat loads. Typically, evaporator <b>116</b> includes one or more flow channels extending internally between an inlet and an outlet of the evaporator, allowing refrigerant fluid to flow through the evaporator <b>116</b> and absorb heat from heat loads in thermal contact with the evaporator <b>116</b>. A variety of different evaporators can be used. In general, any cold plate may function as the evaporator <b>116</b> of the open circuit refrigeration systems disclosed herein as well. Evaporator <b>116</b> can accommodate any refrigerant fluid channels (including mini/micro-channel tubes), blocks of printed circuit heat exchanging structures, or more generally, any heat exchanging structures that are used to transport single-phase or two-phase fluids. The evaporator <b>116</b> and/or components thereof, such as fluid transport channels, can be attached to the heat load mechanically, or can be welded, brazed, or bonded to the heat load in any manner. In some implementations, evaporator <b>116</b> (or certain components thereof) can be fabricated as part of heat loads, such as high heat load <b>118</b> or low heat load <b>120</b> or otherwise integrated into such heat loads. When integrated, the portion of heat loads can include refrigerant fluid channel(s) together with, e.g., a the cold plate, to effectively function as the evaporator <b>116</b> for the TMS <b>100</b> (or other example TMS according to the present disclosure).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The TES <b>128</b>, in this example, is a heat exchanger that provides thermal contact between PCM <b>130</b> and the refrigerant fluid, e.g., from the expansion valve <b>114</b>. For example, one side of the TES <b>128</b> contains the PCM <b>130</b> and the other side may accommodate the refrigerant stream. A TES heat exchanger may be configured as shell-tube heat exchanger that has coolant tubes within the shell, and where the PCM <b>130</b> is disposed inside the shell with refrigerant passing through the tubes. The TES <b>128</b> can be configured as a slab filled with PCM <b>130</b> and with extruded mini/macro channel tubes running through the slab. Alternatively, the PCM <b>130</b> can be encapsulated and emerged in the liquid refrigerant in the shell or in the liquid separator <b>124</b>. Other TES architectures would work.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this example, a single component of each of solenoid valve <b>112</b>, expansion valve <b>114</b>, TES <b>128</b> are fluidly coupled. In a modified configuration of the CCRS <b>10</b>, two sets of solenoid valves <b>112</b> and expansion valves <b>114</b> are located between the receiver outlet <b>111</b> and the inlet <b>125</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b>, with two TES <b>128</b> (with corresponding PCM <b>130</b>) positioned in a parallel arrangement as well. Each TES <b>128</b> can be associated with its own optional solenoid valve <b>112</b> and its own optional expansion valve <b>114</b>, and is configured to generate a subcooling during discharge. Further, each TES <b>128</b> optional solenoid valves can be disposed in parallel and fluidly coupled to the outlet <b>123</b> of evaporator <b>116</b> and inlets <b>139</b> of the TES <b>128</b> (both), via junctions.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another modified configuration of the CCRS <b>10</b>, the locations of the TES <b>128</b> and evaporator <b>116</b> can be switched within the LPS <b>14</b>. For example, the TES <b>128</b> can be disposed such that the inlet <b>139</b> is fluidly coupled to the outlet <b>133</b> of the pump <b>132</b> and, the outlet <b>141</b> is fluidly coupled to an inlet to the junction <b>140</b>. Further, the inlet <b>121</b> of the evaporator <b>116</b> (and low heat load <b>120</b>) can be fluidly coupled to the junction <b>138</b>, while the outlet <b>123</b> is fluidly coupled to inlet <b>125</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In this example implementation of TMS <b>100</b> including VCS <b>12</b>, the VCS <b>12</b> can operate in three operational modes: (1) a TES cooling mode; (2) a heat load cooling mode; and (3) an optional pump-down mode.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Initially, each TMS disclosed herein can operate differently at, and immediately following, system start-up, compared to the manner in which the systems operate after an extended running period. Upon start-up, the compressor <b>104</b> and a cooling device (e.g., fan <b>108</b>) moving a cooling fluid (e.g., ambient air <b>126</b>) through the condenser <b>106</b> are powered. The compressor <b>104</b> discharges compressed refrigerant into the condenser <b>106</b>. The refrigerant is condensed and subcooled in the condenser <b>106</b>. Liquid refrigerant fluid enters receiver <b>110</b> at a pressure and temperature generated by operation of the compressor <b>104</b> and condenser <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an example TES cooling mode, the pump <b>132</b> is either in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; or the &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; states and the low heat load <b>120</b> is &#x201c;OFF.&#x201d; The VCS <b>12</b> operates to &#x201c;charge&#x201d; the TES <b>128</b> and, more particularly, the PCM <b>130</b> in the TES <b>128</b> by directing refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> though the TES <b>128</b> from the expansion valve <b>114</b>. Cooling energy from the refrigerant is stored in the PCM <b>130</b> in latent heat form. The VCS <b>12</b> cools (e.g., freezes) the PCM <b>130</b> in the TES <b>128</b>. The evaporating temperature of refrigerant fluid that has thermal contact with the PCM <b>130</b> is lower than the freezing temperature to enable heat transfer from the PCM <b>130</b> to the refrigerant. Since there is no active low heat load <b>120</b>, the VCS <b>12</b> operates at its lowest evaporating temperature. The compressor <b>104</b> induces vapor from the vapor-side outlet <b>127</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b> at a low pressure and compresses it to a high pressure. The vapor that is at the high pressure and temperature is cooled in the condenser <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the VCS <b>12</b> is transcritical, the condenser <b>106</b> operates as a gas cooler. In some aspects, during transcritical operation (or when a transcritical refrigerant such as carbon dioxide is used for refrigerant fluid <b>1</b>), the receiver <b>110</b> may not be used. When the VCS operation is subcritical, the condenser <b>106</b> operates as a condenser. When operating as a condenser, the refrigerant vapor is de-superheated, condensed, and subcooled.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Liquid refrigerant from the condenser <b>106</b> enters the receiver <b>110</b>. In the expansion valve <b>114</b>, the refrigerant at the high pressure is iso-enthalpically expanded to the low pressure and turns into a two-phase (liquid-vapor) mixture. The liquid portion boils out, cooling/freezing the PCM <b>130</b>. The more the PCM <b>130</b> freezes, the less the heat load would be on the boiling refrigerant in the TES <b>128</b>, and at the same time the evaporator <b>116</b> generates less vapor for the compressor <b>104</b> to pump. The equilibrium between the compressor <b>104</b> and the reduced amount of formed vapor results in a reduced suction pressure, evaporating pressure, and evaporating temperature.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As mentioned above, the pump <b>132</b> may be in either the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; or the &#x2018;OFF&#x2019; states. If there is a risk of over-cooling the heat load <b>118</b>, the pump <b>132</b> should stay in the OFF state. If the TES <b>128</b> is in the liquid separator <b>124</b>, the pump <b>132</b> should stay in the &#x2018;ON&#x2019; state.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The expansion valve <b>114</b> can be configured to generate a superheat or vapor quality at the outlet <b>141</b> of the TES <b>128</b>. If the pump <b>132</b> stays OFF, then the expansion valve <b>114</b> can monitor a superheat; if the pump <b>132</b> is operated to stay ON, then the expansion valve <b>114</b> can control the compressor suction pressure. In the first case at the end of the cooling mode, the solenoid valve <b>112</b> and the expansion valve <b>114</b> are opened to charge the liquid separator <b>124</b> with liquid refrigerant. In the second case, liquid refrigerant is continuously fed to the liquid separator <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The receiver <b>110</b> and the liquid separator <b>124</b> are configured to manage liquid refrigerant charge moving from the receiver <b>110</b> to the liquid separator <b>124</b>.

To avoid cavitation, the liquid at the pump inlet is subcooled by maintaining a net positive suction head.

The subcooled liquid generated at the outlet <b>141</b> enters the inlet <b>125</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b>, and the LPS <b>14</b> operates as a regular closed-circuit pumping system. If the TES <b>128</b> generates a vapor quality at the outlet <b>141</b>, then the vapor/liquid refrigerant is fed to the liquid separator <b>124</b> and the vapor portion (i.e., vapor section <b>142</b>) of the vapor/liquid refrigerant exits from the vapor-side outlet <b>127</b> and feeds the inlet <b>101</b> of the compressor <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the heat load cooling mode, the VCS <b>12</b> and LPS <b>14</b> may operate simultaneously.

This operation allows the overall cooling capacity of TES <b>128</b> to increase and/or extends the cooling period.

For example, the pump <b>132</b> may be configured to generate at the evaporator outlet <b>123</b> a vapor quality below the critical vapor quality under all operating conditions. The pumping capacity and the exit vapor quality are related. That is, if the pumping capacity is too low, the pumping flow rate that results causes higher vapor quality, which may exceed the critical vapor quality. On the other hand, if the pumping capacity is too high, the pumping flow rate reduces the exit vapor quality, but requires higher parasitic pumping power and elevates the risk of cavitation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">However, generally the liquid pumping power is very low thus the parasitic load on the TES <b>128</b> is not significant.

Alternatively, the pump <b>132</b> may be configured to generate a superheat at the evaporator outlet <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">VCS <b>12</b> can also operate in a pump-down mode. For example, in the pump-down mode, the refrigerant liquid accumulated in the liquid separator <b>124</b> is returned to the receiver <b>110</b>. In the pump-down mode, the low heat load <b>120</b> is OFF, the pump <b>132</b> is OFF, the optional solenoid valve <b>112</b> and/or the expansion valve <b>114</b> are closed and the compressor <b>104</b> is ON. The compressor <b>104</b> drives vapor from the liquid separator <b>124</b> and returns it to the receiver <b>110</b> via the condenser <b>106</b> (operating as a condenser rather than a gas cooler) by condensing the compressed vapor outputted by the compressor <b>104</b>. During compressor operation, the pressure in the liquid separator <b>124</b> is reduced, the evaporating temperature is reduced, and refrigerant fluid evaporates, generating new portions for the compressor <b>104</b> to compress.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Various indicators can be used to show that the receiver <b>110</b> is full. Some of these indicators include: the temperature downstream from the condenser <b>106</b> and the pressure of the high side indicating a certain amount of sub-cooling, a certain amount of pressure on the high side at a given ambient temperature, a certain amount of liquid level in the receiver <b>110</b>, a certain amount of liquid level in the liquid separator <b>124</b>, a certain value of a suction pressure, and/or a certain value of a pumping down period. When the pump-down is completed, the VCS <b>12</b> executes the first mode again and gets ready to cool the low heat load <b>120</b> again.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some aspects of TMS <b>100</b> (and other example TMS), if the expansion valve <b>114</b> has a capability to stop refrigerant flow from the receiver <b>110</b>, the solenoid control valve <b>112</b> may not be needed. If the expansion valve <b>114</b> provides an active control of the superheat, the liquid migration from the receiver <b>110</b> to the liquid separator <b>124</b> does not happen, and the pump-down mode is not performed. Rather, the VCS <b>12</b> executes the TES cooling mode, and gets ready to cool the low heat load <b>120</b> again. The liquid separator <b>124</b> requires a certain level of liquid in the liquid separator <b>124</b> for enabling pump operation, while, an excessive amount of liquid at the vapor-side outlet <b>127</b> of the liquid separator <b>124</b> can damage the compressor <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The TES <b>128</b> can generate a vapor quality during the discharge or the TES <b>128</b> can generate a subcooling during the discharge. When the TES <b>128</b> generates vapor quality, the VCS <b>12</b> and TES <b>128</b> may operate simultaneously. The TES <b>128</b> and the VCS <b>12</b> are configured to fully satisfy the low heat load <b>120</b> at any given duty cycle. The TMS <b>100</b> is configured to cool the TES <b>128</b> within the cycle period, when the heat load is OFF. In this arrangement, pump cavitation can be a concern.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the TES <b>128</b> generates subcooling, the TES <b>128</b> and VCS <b>12</b> operate in sequence since there is no vapor for the compressor <b>104</b> to compress. The TES <b>128</b> is configured to fully satisfy the low heat load <b>120</b> at any given duty cycle. As in the vapor quality case, the TMS <b>100</b> is configured to cool the TES <b>128</b> within the cycle period when the low heat load <b>120</b> is OFF. However, in the subcooling case, the TES <b>128</b> and VCS <b>12</b> are configured to handle larger heat loads than those in the vapor quality case to maintain the same duty cycle. The larger the duty cycle is, the larger the TES <b>128</b> and VCS <b>12</b> are required.

Control system <b>999</b> may receive signals, process received signals and send signals (as appropriate) from/to the sensors and control devices to operate the TMS <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The term &#x201c;control system,&#x201d; as used herein, can refer to an overall system that provides control signals and receives feedback data from unit controllers, such as unit controllers (e.g., programmable logic controllers, motor controllers, variable frequency drives, actuators). In some aspects, the control system includes the overall system and the unit controllers. In some aspects, a control system simply refers to as a single unit controller or a network of two or more individual unit controllers that communicate directly with each other (rather than with an overall system.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The process streams (e.g., refrigerant flows, ambient airflows, other heat exchange fluid flows) in a TMS according to the present disclosure, as well as process streams within any downstream processes with which the TMS is fluidly coupled, can be flowed using one or more flow control systems (e.g., that include the control system <b>999</b>) implemented throughout the system. A flow control system can include one or more flow pumps, fans, blowers, or solids conveyors to move the process streams, one or more flow pipes through which the process streams are flowed and one or more valves to regulate the flow of streams through the pipes, whether shown in the exemplary figures or not. Each of the configurations described herein can include at least one variable frequency drive (VFD) coupled to a respective pump or fan that is capable of controlling at least one fluid flow rate. In some implementations, liquid flow rates are controlled by at least one flow control valve.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, a flow control system can be operated manually. For example, an operator can set a flow rate for each pump or transfer device and set valve open or close positions to regulate the flow of the process streams through the pipes in the flow control system. Once the operator has set the flow rates and the valve open or close positions for all flow control systems distributed across the system, the flow control system can flow the streams under constant flow conditions, for example, constant volumetric rate or other flow conditions. To change the flow conditions, the operator can manually operate the flow control system, for example, by changing the pump flow rate or the valve open or close position.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments, a flow control system can be operated automatically. For example, the flow control system can be connected to a computer or control system (e.g., control system <b>999</b>) to operate the flow control system. The control system can include a computer-readable medium storing instructions (such as flow control instructions and other instructions) executable by one or more processors to perform operations (such as flow control operations). An operator can set the flow rates and the valve open or close positions for all flow control systems distributed across the facility using the control system and/or a liquid level sensor for the evaporator <b>116</b>. In such embodiments, the operator can manually change the flow conditions by providing inputs through the control system. Also, in such embodiments, the control system can automatically (that is, without manual intervention) control one or more of the flow control systems, for example, using feedback systems connected to the control system. For example, a sensor (such as a pressure sensor, temperature sensor or other sensor) can be connected to a pipe through which a fluid flows. The sensor can monitor and provide a flow condition (such as a pressure, temperature, or other flow condition) of the process stream to the control system. In response to the flow condition exceeding a threshold (such as a threshold pressure value, a threshold temperature value, or other threshold value), the control system can automatically perform operations. For example, if the pressure or temperature in the pipe exceeds the threshold pressure value or the threshold temperature value, respectively, the control system can provide a signal to the pump to decrease a flow rate, a signal to open a valve to relieve the pressure, a signal to shut down process stream flow, or other signals.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an example of a thermal management system (TMS) <b>200</b> is shown to include a vapor cycle system (VCS) <b>22</b> and an ejector assist circuit <b>24</b> that are arranged in a closed-circuit refrigeration system (CCRS) <b>20</b>.

A mixing chamber of a constant area receives the primary flow of refrigerant and secondary flow of refrigerant and mixes these flows. A diffuser diffuses the flow to deliver an expanded flow at the outlet <b>205</b>. Liquid refrigerant from the receiver <b>110</b> is the primary flow. In a motive nozzle, potential energy of the primary flow at the inlet <b>201</b> is converted into kinetic energy reducing the potential energy (the established static pressure) of the primary flow. The secondary flow at the secondary inlet <b>203</b> from the outlet <b>141</b> of the TES <b>128</b> has a pressure that is higher than an established static pressure in the suction chamber, and thus the secondary flow is entrained through the suction inlet (secondary inlet <b>203</b>) and the secondary nozzles internal to the ejector <b>202</b>. The two streams (primary flow and secondary flow) mix together in a mixing section. In a diffuser section, the kinetic energy of the mixed streams is converted into potential energy elevating the pressure of the mixed flow liquid/vapor refrigerant that leaves the ejector outlet <b>205</b> and is fed to the liquid separator inlet <b>121</b> of the evaporator <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The use of the ejector <b>202</b> can allow for recirculation of liquid refrigerant captured by the liquid separator <b>124</b> to increase the efficiency of the TMS <b>200</b> (e.g., relative to a non-ejector system).

In optional OCRS <b>33</b>, the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> controls the refrigerant fluid pressure upstream from the evaporator <b>116</b> and back-pressure regulator <b>306</b>. A back-pressure regulator (BPR) is a device that regulates fluid pressure upstream from the regulator. In general, a wide range of different mechanical and electrical/electronic devices can be used as back-pressure regulator <b>306</b>. Typically, mechanical back-pressure regulating devices have an orifice and a spring supporting a moving seat against the pressure of the refrigerant fluid stream. The moving seat adjusts the cross-sectional area of the orifice and the refrigerant fluid volume and mass flow rates. Typical electrical back-pressure regulating devices include an orifice, a moving seat, a motor or actuator that changes the position of the seat in respect to the orifice, a control system <b>999</b>, and a pressure sensor at the evaporator exit or at the valve inlet. If the refrigerant fluid pressure is above a set-point value, the seat moves to increase the cross-sectional area of the orifice and the refrigerant fluid volume and mass flow rates to re-establish the set-point pressure value. If the refrigerant fluid pressure is below the set-point value, the seat moves to decrease the cross-sectional area and the refrigerant fluid flow rates. In general, back-pressure regulators are selected based on the refrigerant fluid volume flow rate, the pressure differential across the regulator, and the pressure and temperature at the regulator inlet. Examples of suitable commercially available back-pressure regulators that can function as the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> include, but are not limited to, valves available from the Sporlan Division of Parker Hannifin Corporation (Washington, Mo.) and from Danfoss (Syddanmark, Denmark).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, recuperative heat exchanger <b>302</b> includes inlet <b>303</b> that is fluidly coupled to outlet <b>111</b> of the receiver <b>110</b>.

In some embodiments, for example, a temperature sensor can be attached to the low heat load <b>120</b> and/or high heat load <b>118</b>. When the temperature of either low heat load <b>120</b> and/or high heat load <b>118</b> exceeds a certain temperature set point (i.e., threshold value), the control system <b>999</b> connected to the temperature sensor can initiate cooling of the respective low heat load <b>120</b> by the CCRS <b>30</b> or cooling of the high heat load <b>118</b> by the OCRS <b>36</b>. Another mechanism is when the PCM <b>130</b> is melted and the stored cooling energy in the PCM <b>130</b> is depleted. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, optional OCRS <b>33</b> operates essentially continuously&#x2014;provided that the pressure within receiver <b>110</b> is sufficient&#x2014;to cool high heat load <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Upon initiation of a cooling operation, refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> from receiver <b>110</b> is discharged from the outlet <b>111</b> and through solenoid valve <b>112</b> (if present). The driving force for the transport of refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> through OCRS <b>36</b> is the pressure within receiver <b>110</b>. As refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> leaves receiver <b>110</b>, it is transported to the expansion valve <b>114</b>, which directly or indirectly controls vapor quality at the evaporator outlet <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Once inside the expansion valve <b>114</b>, the refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> undergoes constant enthalpy expansion from an initial pressure p<sub>r </sub>(i.e., the receiver pressure) to an evaporation pressure p<sub>c </sub>at the outlet <b>123</b> of the expansion valve <b>114</b>. In general, the evaporation pressure p<sub>c </sub>depends on a variety of factors, most notably the desired temperature set point value (i.e., the target temperature) at which high heat load <b>118</b> is to be maintained and/or the heat input generated by the low heat load <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The initial pressure in the receiver <b>110</b> tends to be in equilibrium with the surrounding temperature and is different for different refrigerant fluids. The pressure in the evaporator <b>116</b> depends on the evaporating temperature, which is lower than the heat load temperature and is defined during design of the TMS <b>300</b>. The system is operational as long the receiver-to-evaporator pressure difference is sufficient to drive adequate refrigerant fluid flow through the expansion valve <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">After undergoing constant enthalpy expansion in the expansion valve <b>114</b>, the liquid refrigerant fluid is converted to a mixture of liquid and vapor phases at the temperature of the fluid and evaporation pressure p<sub>c</sub>. The two-phase refrigerant fluid mixture is transported to evaporator <b>116</b>. When the two-phase mixture of refrigerant fluid is directed into evaporator <b>116</b>, the liquid phase absorbs heat from high heat load <b>118</b>, driving a phase transition of the liquid refrigerant fluid into the vapor phase. Because this phase transition occurs at (nominally) constant temperature, the temperature of the refrigerant fluid mixture within evaporator <b>116</b> remains unchanged, provided at least some liquid refrigerant fluid remains in evaporator <b>116</b> to absorb heat.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Further, the constant temperature of the refrigerant fluid mixture within evaporator <b>116</b> can be controlled by adjusting the pressure p<sub>c </sub>of the refrigerant fluid, since adjustment of p<sub>e </sub>changes the boiling temperature of the refrigerant fluid. Thus, by regulating the refrigerant fluid pressure p<sub>c </sub>upstream from evaporator <b>116</b> (e.g., using back-pressure regulator <b>306</b>), the temperature of the refrigerant fluid within evaporator <b>116</b> (and, nominally, the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b>) can be controlled to match a specific temperature set-point value for high heat load <b>118</b>, ensuring that high heat load <b>118</b> is maintained at, or very near, a target temperature. The low heat load <b>120</b> is likewise cooled by refrigerant received from the pump outlet.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The pressure drop across the evaporator <b>116</b> may cause a drop of the temperature of the refrigerant mixture (which is the evaporating temperature), but still the evaporator <b>116</b> can be configured to maintain the heat load temperature within in the set tolerances.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, for example, the evaporation pressure of the refrigerant fluid can be adjusted by the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> to ensure that the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> is maintained to within &#xb1;5 degrees C. (e.g., to within &#xb1;4 degrees C., to within &#xb1;3 degrees C., to within &#xb1;2 degrees C., to within &#xb1;1 degree C.) of the temperature set point value for high heat load <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">As discussed above, within evaporator <b>116</b>, a portion of the liquid refrigerant in the two-phase refrigerant fluid mixture is converted to refrigerant vapor by undergoing a phase change. As a result, the refrigerant fluid mixture that emerges from evaporator <b>116</b> has a higher vapor quality (i.e., the fraction of the vapor phase that exists in refrigerant fluid mixture) than the refrigerant fluid mixture that enters evaporator <b>116</b>. As the refrigerant fluid mixture emerges from evaporator <b>116</b>, a portion of the refrigerant fluid can optionally be used to cool one or more additional heat loads <b>120</b>. Typically, for example, the refrigerant fluid that emerges from evaporator <b>116</b> is nearly in the vapor phase. The refrigerant fluid vapor (or, more precisely, high vapor quality fluid vapor) can be directed into a heat exchanger coupled to another low heat load <b>120</b> and can absorb heat from the additional low heat load <b>120</b> during propagation through the evaporator <b>116</b>. Examples of systems in which the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> is used to cool additional thermal loads <b>120</b> will be discussed in more detail subsequently.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> is transported to the compressor inlet <b>101</b> and the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> inlet, via the junction <b>304</b>. The set point pressure at the inlet of the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> controls the portion of the refrigerant stream that is discharged and the portion that is compressed. The back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> also directly or indirectly controls the upstream pressure, that is, the evaporating pressure p<sub>c </sub>in the system. After passing a portion of the refrigerant vapor through back-pressure regulator <b>306</b>, the refrigerant fluid is discharged through the exhaust <b>38</b>. Refrigerant fluid discharge can occur directly into the environment surrounding optional OCRS <b>33</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the refrigerant fluid can be further processed; various features and aspects of such processing are discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">It should be noted that the foregoing steps, while discussed sequentially for purposes of clarity, occur simultaneously and continuously during cooling operations. In other words, refrigerant fluid is continuously being discharged from receiver <b>110</b>, undergoing continuous expansion in expansion valve <b>114</b>, flowing continuously through evaporator <b>116</b> and back-pressure regulator <b>306</b>, and being discharged from optional OCRS <b>33</b>, while high heat load <b>118</b> is being cooled.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">As discussed in the previous section, by adjusting the pressure p<sub>c </sub>of the refrigerant fluid, the temperature at which the liquid refrigerant phase undergoes vaporization within evaporator <b>116</b> can be controlled. Thus, in general, the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> can be controlled by a device or component of optional OCRS <b>33</b> that regulates the pressure of the refrigerant fluid within evaporator <b>116</b>. Typically, the back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> adjusts the upstream refrigerant fluid pressure in OCRS <b>36</b>. Accordingly, back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> is generally configured to control the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> and can be adjusted to selectively change a temperature set point value (i.e., a target temperature) for high heat load <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Another important system operating parameter is the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b>. The vapor quality, which is a number from 0 to 1, represents the fraction of the refrigerant fluid that is in the vapor phase. Because heat absorbed from high heat load <b>118</b> is used to drive evaporation of liquid refrigerant to form refrigerant vapor in evaporator <b>116</b>, it is generally important to ensure that, for a particular volume of refrigerant fluid propagating through evaporator <b>116</b>, at least some of the refrigerant fluid remains in liquid form right up to the point at which the exit aperture of evaporator <b>116</b> is reached to allow continued heat absorption from high heat load <b>118</b> without causing a temperature increase of the refrigerant fluid. If the fluid is fully converted to the vapor phase after propagating only partially through evaporator <b>116</b>, further heat absorption by the now vapor-phase refrigerant fluid within evaporator <b>116</b> will lead to a temperature increase of the refrigerant fluid and high heat load <b>118</b>. Even before all refrigerant fluid is converted to the vapor phase, if the temperature of the refrigerant fluid increases, further heat absorption by the two-phase refrigerant fluid mixture can occur at a vapor quality that is above the critical vapor quality that drives the evaporation process in a portion of evaporator <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">On the other hand, liquid-phase refrigerant fluid that emerges from evaporator <b>116</b> represents unused heat-absorbing capacity, in that the liquid refrigerant fluid did not absorb sufficient heat from high heat load <b>118</b> to undergo a phase change. To ensure that optional OCRS <b>33</b> operates efficiently, the liquid is captured by the liquid separator <b>124</b> and recirculated via pump <b>132</b> as shown.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In addition, the boiling heat transfer coefficient that characterizes the effectiveness of heat transfer from high heat load <b>118</b> to the refrigerant fluid <b>1</b> is typically very sensitive to vapor quality. When the vapor quality increases from zero to a certain value, called a critical vapor quality, the heat transfer coefficient increases. When the vapor quality exceeds the critical vapor quality, the heat transfer coefficient is abruptly reduced to a very low value, causing dryout within evaporator <b>116</b>. In this region of operation, the two-phase mixture behaves as superheated vapor.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In general, the critical vapor quality and heat transfer coefficient values vary widely for different refrigerant fluids, and heat and mass fluxes. For all such refrigerant fluids and operating conditions, the systems and methods disclosed herein control the vapor quality at the outlet of the evaporator <b>116</b> such that the vapor quality approaches the threshold of the critical vapor quality. The use of the liquid separator <b>124</b> captures liquid that is recirculated by the pump <b>132</b> allowing operation at lower a vapor quality.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">To make maximum use of the heat-absorbing capacity of the two-phase refrigerant fluid mixture when operating in the open-circuit mode, the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> is less than the critical vapor quality and avoids the dryout and mist regions. Accordingly, to both efficiently use the heat-absorbing capacity of the two-phase refrigerant fluid mixture and also ensure that the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> remains approximately constant at the phase transition temperature of the refrigerant fluid in evaporator <b>116</b>, the systems and methods disclosed herein are generally configured to adjust the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> to a value that is less than the critical vapor quality, with any liquid subsequently captured by the liquid separator <b>124</b> and recirculated by the pump <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Another important operating consideration for OCRS <b>36</b> is the mass flow rate of refrigerant fluid within the OCRS <b>36</b>. Evaporator <b>116</b> can be configured to provide minimal mass flow rate controlling maximal vapor quality, which is below the critical vapor quality. By minimizing the mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid according to the cooling requirements for high heat load <b>118</b>, OCRS <b>36</b> operates efficiently. Each reduction in the mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid (while maintaining the same temperature set point value for high heat load <b>118</b>) means that the charge of refrigerant fluid added to receiver <b>110</b> initially lasts longer, providing further operating time for OCRS <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Within evaporator <b>116</b>, the vapor quality of a given quantity of refrigerant fluid varies from the evaporator inlet (where vapor quality is lowest) to the evaporator outlet (where vapor quality is highest). Nonetheless, to realize the lowest possible mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid within the system, the effective vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid within evaporator <b>116</b>, even when accounting for variations that occur within evaporator <b>116</b>, should match the critical vapor quality as closely as possible, with any liquid subsequently captured by the liquid separator <b>124</b> and recirculated by the pump <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In summary, to ensure that OCRS <b>36</b> operates efficiently and the mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid is relatively low, and at the same time the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> is maintained within a relatively small tolerance, OCRS <b>36</b> adjusts the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> to a value such that an effective vapor quality within evaporator <b>116</b> is less than the critical vapor quality.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In OCRS <b>36</b>, expansion valve <b>114</b> is generally configured to control the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b>. As an example, when expansion valve <b>114</b> is implemented as an expansion valve, the expansion valve regulates the mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid through the valve. In turn, for a given set of operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperature, initial pressure in the receiver <b>110</b>, temperature set point value for high heat load <b>118</b>), the vapor quality determines mass flow rate of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b>. While expansion valve <b>114</b> typically controls the vapor quality of the refrigerant fluid emerging from evaporator <b>116</b> in response to information about at least one thermodynamic quantity that is either directly or indirectly related to the vapor quality, back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> typically adjusts the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b> (via upstream refrigerant fluid pressure adjustments) in response to information about at least one thermodynamic quantity that is directly or indirectly related to the temperature of high heat load <b>118</b>. The one or more thermodynamic quantities upon which adjustment of expansion valve <b>114</b> is based are different from the one or more thermodynamic quantities upon which adjustment of back-pressure regulator <b>306</b> is based.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In implementations of TMS <b>300</b> that include the recuperative heat exchanger <b>302</b>, the TMS <b>300</b> can operate as a transcritical system.

Direct discharge provides a convenient and straightforward method for handling spent refrigerant and has the added advantage that, over time, the overall weight of the system is reduced due to the loss of refrigerant fluid. For systems that are mounted to small vehicles or are otherwise mobile, this reduction in weight can be important.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">In some embodiments, however, refrigerant fluid vapor can be further processed before it is discharged. Further processing may be desirable depending upon the nature of the refrigerant fluid that is used, as direct discharge of unprocessed refrigerant fluid vapor may be hazardous to humans and/or may be deleterious to mechanical and/or electronic devices in the vicinity of a TMS. For example, the unprocessed refrigerant fluid vapor may be flammable or toxic, or may corrode metallic device components. In situations such as these, additional processing of the refrigerant fluid vapor may be desirable.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In general, refrigerant processing apparatus can be implemented in various ways. In some embodiments, refrigerant processing apparatus is a chemical scrubber or water-based scrubber. Within apparatus, the refrigerant fluid is exposed to one or more chemical agents that treat the refrigerant fluid vapor to reduce its deleterious properties. For example, where the refrigerant fluid vapor is basic (e.g., ammonia) or acidic, the refrigerant fluid vapor can be exposed to one or more chemical agents that neutralize the vapor and yield a less basic or acidic product that can be collected for disposal or discharged from apparatus.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">As another example where the refrigerant fluid vapor is highly chemically reactive, the refrigerant fluid vapor can be exposed to one or more chemical agents that oxidize, reduce, or otherwise react with the refrigerant fluid vapor to yield a less reactive product that can be collected for disposal or discharged from apparatus.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In certain embodiments, refrigerant processing apparatus can be implemented as an adsorptive sink for the refrigerant fluid. Apparatus can include, for example, an adsorbent material bed that binds particles of the refrigerant fluid vapor, trapping the refrigerant fluid within apparatus and preventing discharge. The adsorptive process can sequester the refrigerant fluid particles within the adsorbent material bed, which can then be removed from apparatus and sent for disposal.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments, where the refrigerant fluid is flammable, refrigerant processing apparatus can be implemented as an incinerator. Incoming refrigerant fluid vapor can be mixed with oxygen or another oxidizing agent and ignited to combust the refrigerant fluid. The combustion products can be discharged from the incinerator or collected (e.g., via an adsorbent material bed) for later disposal.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">As an alternative, refrigerant processing apparatus can also be implemented as a combustor of an engine or another mechanical power-generating device. Refrigerant fluid vapor from conduit can be mixed with oxygen, for example, and combusted in a piston-based engine or turbine to perform mechanical work, such as providing drive power for a vehicle or driving a generator to produce electricity. In certain embodiments, the generated electricity can be used to provide electrical operating power for one or more devices, including high heat load <b>118</b>. For example, high heat load <b>118</b> can include one or more electronic devices that are powered, at least in part, by electrical energy generated from combustion of refrigerant fluid vapor in refrigerant processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The thermal management systems disclosed herein can optionally include a phase separator upstream from the refrigerant processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Particularly during start-up of the systems disclosed herein, liquid refrigerant may be present in conduits because the systems generally begin operation before a high temperature heat load and/or low or high heat loads are activated. Accordingly, phase separator functions in a manner similar to phase separators to separate liquid refrigerant fluid from refrigerant vapor. The separated liquid refrigerant fluid can be re-directed to another portion of the system, or retained within phase separator until it is converted to refrigerant vapor. By using phase separator, liquid refrigerant fluid can be prevented from entering refrigerant processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In some embodiments, the refrigeration systems disclosed herein can be combined with power systems to form integrated power and thermal systems, in which certain components of the integrated systems are responsible for providing refrigeration functions and certain components of the integrated systems are responsible for generating operating power.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an integrated power and TMS that includes many features similar to those discussed above (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>) with only aspects of the open-circuit portions shown. In example implementations, a TMS or portion of a TMS is coupled to or is part of an engine <b>700</b> with an inlet that receives the stream of waste refrigerant fluid. Engine <b>700</b> can combust the waste refrigerant fluid directly, or alternatively, can mix the waste refrigerant fluid with one or more additives (such as oxidizers) before combustion.
