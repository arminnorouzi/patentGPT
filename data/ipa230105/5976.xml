Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts. In the following description, a detailed description of related known configurations or functions incorporated herein will be omitted to avoid obscuring the subject matter.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an image sensing device based on some implementations of the disclosed technology.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the image sensing device may include a pixel array <b>100</b>, a row driver <b>200</b>, a correlated double sampler (CDS) <b>300</b>, an analog-digital converter (ADC) <b>400</b>, an output buffer <b>500</b>, a column driver <b>600</b> and a timing controller <b>700</b>. The components of the image sensing device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are discussed by way of example only, and this patent document encompasses numerous other changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and modifications.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pixel array <b>100</b> may include a plurality of unit pixels (PXs) consecutively arranged in row and column directions. Each unit pixel (PX) may generate a pixel signal corresponding to incident light through conversion of the incident light. In this case, each unit pixel (PX) may include a photoelectric conversion element for converting incident light into photocharges, and a plurality of switching elements (e.g., a transfer transistor, a reset transistor, a source follower transistor, and a selection transistor) for outputting a pixel signal by reading out the photocharges received from the photoelectric conversion element. In addition, each unit pixel (PX) may include any one of a red color filter, a green color filter, and a blue color filter, and the unit pixels (PXs) may be arranged in a Bayer pattern. A grid structure for preventing crosstalk of the incident light may be disposed between the color filters of the unit pixels (PXs) adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pixel array <b>100</b> may receive driving signals (for example, a row selection signal, a reset signal, a transmission (or transfer) signal, etc.) from the row driver <b>200</b>. Upon receiving the driving signal, the unit pixels may be activated to perform the operations corresponding to the row selection signal, the reset signal, and the transfer signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The row driver <b>200</b> may activate the pixel array <b>100</b> to perform certain operations on the unit pixels in the corresponding row based on control signals provided by controller circuitry such as the timing controller <b>700</b>. In some implementations, the row driver <b>200</b> may select one or more pixel groups arranged in one or more rows of the pixel array <b>100</b>. The row driver <b>200</b> may generate a row selection signal to select one or more rows from among the plurality of rows. The row driver <b>200</b> may sequentially enable the reset signal and the transfer signal for the unit pixels arranged in the selected row. The pixel signals generated by the unit pixels arranged in the selected row may be output to the correlated double sampler (CDS) <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The correlated double sampler (CDS) <b>300</b> may remove undesired offset values of the unit pixels using correlated double sampling. In one example, the correlated double sampler (CDS) <b>300</b> may remove the undesired offset values of the unit pixels by comparing output voltages of pixel signals (of the unit pixels) obtained before and after photocharges generated by incident light are accumulated in the sensing node (i.e., a floating diffusion (FD) node). As a result, the CDS <b>300</b> may obtain a pixel signal generated only by the incident light without causing noise. In some implementations, upon receiving a clock signal from the timing controller <b>700</b>, the CDS <b>300</b> may sequentially sample and hold voltage levels of the reference signal and the pixel signal, which are provided to each of a plurality of column lines from the pixel array <b>100</b>. That is, the CDS <b>300</b> may sample and hold the voltage levels of the reference signal and the pixel signal which correspond to each of the columns of the pixel array <b>100</b>. In some implementations, the CDS <b>300</b> may transfer the reference signal and the pixel signal of each of the columns as a correlate double sampling (CDS) signal to the ADC <b>400</b> based on control signals from the timing controller <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ADC <b>400</b> is used to convert analog CDS signals received from the CDS <b>300</b> into digital signals. In some implementations, the ADC <b>400</b> may be implemented as a ramp-compare type ADC. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>400</b> may compare a ramp signal received from the timing controller <b>700</b> with the CDS signal received from the CDS <b>300</b>, and may thus output a comparison signal indicating the result of comparison between the ramp signal and the CDS signal. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>400</b> may count a level transition time of the comparison signal in response to the ramp signal received from the timing controller <b>700</b>, and may output a count value indicating the counted level transition time to the output buffer <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The output buffer <b>500</b> may temporarily store column-based image data provided from the ADC <b>400</b> based on control signals of the timing controller <b>170</b>. The image data received from the ADC <b>400</b> may be temporarily stored in the output buffer <b>500</b> based on control signals of the timing controller <b>700</b>. The output buffer <b>500</b> may provide an interface to compensate for data rate differences or transmission rate differences between the image sensing device and other devices.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The column driver <b>600</b> may select a column of the output buffer <b>500</b> upon receiving a control signal from the timing controller <b>700</b>, and sequentially output the image data, which are temporarily stored in the selected column of the output buffer <b>500</b>. In some implementations, upon receiving an address signal from the timing controller <b>700</b>, the column driver <b>600</b> may generate a column selection signal based on the address signal, may select a column of the output buffer <b>500</b> using the column selection signal, and may control the image data received from the selected column of the output buffer <b>500</b> to be output as an output signal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The timing controller <b>700</b> may generate signals for controlling operations of the row driver <b>200</b>, the ADC <b>400</b>, the output buffer <b>500</b> and the column driver <b>600</b>.
