For example, certain military aircraft are configured to discharge various types of stores, such as munitions including bombs, missiles, rockets, or the like, and non-munitions, such as electronic equipment, devices, chaff, decoys, and/or the like. As another example, commercial aircraft can be configured to discharge various stores, such as products for delivery (which may be coupled to parachutes).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known methods for internal store deployment include doors opening in the inboard or outboard direction about an axis that is parallel to a longitudinal axis of an aircraft. Such systems are configured to allow the stores to drop down from the aircraft. Such methods for store deployment are suitable for subsonic and supersonic store release.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in relation to hypersonic aircraft, extreme air-loads and temperatures associated with store release make traditional known deployment methods impossible or next to impossible. In particular, during hypersonic flight, aerodynamic flow fields along with a turbulent boundary layer proximate to the hypersonic aircraft create strong shocks on surfaces (such as bay doors) protruding from a mold line of the aircraft. Additionally, cavity flow in a store bay can cause intense acoustic shocks on the bay structure. Further, air friction can generate extreme heat on surfaces of the hypersonic aircraft.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, for aircraft that operate at extremely high speeds (for example, hypersonic), in particular, continuous thermal and aerodynamic seals are typically needed at forward edges of in-flight deployable doors to prevent damage to internal structure or stores. Such seals are typically very stiff and require small deflections (stretching or bending) during operation. However, excessive preload induced into the stiff seals may cause failure and/or require frequent maintenance. Indeed, there is currently no known system and method for continuous thermal/aerodynamic sealing relation to in-flight deployable doors of hypersonic aircraft.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need exists for an efficient and effective system and method for operating a deployable door of an aircraft, such as during flight. Further, a need exists for a system and method for reducing seal deformation during operation of the deployable door.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With those needs in mind, certain embodiments of the subject disclosure provide a hinge assembly of a system for operating a door of an aircraft. The hinge assembly includes a bracket secured to a structure of the aircraft. The bracket includes a first forward joint and a first aft joint separated by a first distance. A forward link is coupled to the first forward joint. An aft link is longer than the forward link. The aft link is coupled to the first aft joint. A door coupler is secured to the door. The door coupler includes a second forward joint and a second aft joint separated by a second distance that is less than the first distance. The forward link is further coupled to the second forward joint, and the aft link is further coupled to the second aft joint.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one embodiment, rotation of the forward link and the aft link causes rotation of the door coupler and the door between a stowed position in which a gap between a forward edge of the door and an outer skin of the aircraft is less than a predetermined distance, and an open position in which the gap is less than the predetermined distance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In at least one embodiment, a seal is disposed between the outer skin of the aircraft and the door. The seal extends over the gap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As an example, the predetermined distance is less than or equal to 0.030 inches.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In at least one embodiment, rotation of the forward link and the aft link causes rotation of the door about a pivot axis that is at or proximate to a forward edge of the door. In at least one embodiment, the pivot axis is at an outer mold line of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In at least one example, the aircraft is a hypersonic aircraft.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In at least one embodiment, the door coupler is secured to a top surface of the door at a forward edge of the door.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In at least one embodiment, the second forward joint is forward and below the first forward joint, and the second aft joint is forward and below the first aft joint.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Certain embodiments of the subject disclosure provide a method for providing a hinge assembly of a system for operating a door of an aircraft.

Accordingly, embodiments of the subject disclosure provide a system for operating a door of an aircraft, which provides a virtual pivot point hinge assembly that facilitates a continuous seal at the forward facing edge. In at least one embodiment, the hinge assembly provides a fixed virtual pivot point (axis) at an outer mold line of the aircraft. The fixed pivot allows for a small gap between the door and the outer mold line, minimized or otherwise reduced thermal/aerodynamic seal flexing at the forward edge of deployable door, which, in turn allows for stronger (stiffer) seals to be used that are not or otherwise less susceptible to fatigue and damage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described herein, the system for operating the door of the aircraft provides one or more hinge assemblies that provide a virtual pivot point. The virtual point is at a fixed location at or proximate to an outer mold line of the aircraft, which minimizes or otherwise reduces deformation of the seal during operation (for example, opening and closing) of the door.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic block diagram of an aircraft <b>100</b> including a system <b>102</b> for operating a deployable door <b>104</b>, according to an embodiment of the subject disclosure.

In the stowed position, the gap <b>180</b> can be the predetermined distance. In the deployed position, as the door <b>104</b> rotates open, the gap <b>180</b> is maintained below the predetermined distance.

The configuration of hinge assembl(ies) <b>106</b>, as described herein, allows the continuous seal <b>190</b> at the forward facing edge (that is, the forward edge <b>116</b>) of the door <b>104</b>. In particular, the first length <b>147</b> of the forward link <b>146</b>, the second length <b>153</b> of the aft link <b>152</b>, the first distance <b>140</b>, and the second distance <b>168</b> provide the pivot axis <b>120</b> at (such as on or within) the outer mold line <b>192</b> of the aircraft <b>100</b>. The pivot axis <b>120</b> allows for a small gap <b>180</b> between the door <b>104</b> and the outer mold line <b>192</b>, and reduces flexing of the seal <b>190</b>, thereby reducing fatigue and/or damage to the seal <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each hinge assembly <b>106</b> provides a four bar linkage, such that the links include the bracket <b>130</b>, the forward link <b>146</b>, the aft link <b>152</b>, and the door coupler <b>160</b>. The hinge assemblies <b>106</b> allow the door to be rotated between the stowed position and the deployed position at a relatively small angle. For example, the rotation angle can be less than 10&#xb0;. In particular, the rotation angle can be less than 7&#xb0;, such as 6.2&#xb0;. The location of the pivot axis <b>120</b> at the outer mold line <b>192</b> and the small rotation angle provides for a small gap <b>180</b>, such as less than 0.030 inches. Accordingly, the seal <b>190</b> experiences a small amount of deflection as the door <b>104</b> is moved between stowed and deployed positions. Because the hinge assemblies <b>106</b> allow for minimized or otherwise reduced deflection of the seal <b>190</b>, the preload applied on the seal <b>190</b> is limited, and the seal <b>190</b> can therefore be constructed of materials having increased stiffness and resilience.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a perspective front view of an aircraft <b>100</b>, according to an example of the subject disclosure.
