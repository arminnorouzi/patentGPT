The upper may be formed from any suitable material(s) to receive, secure, and support a foot on the sole structure. The upper may cooperate with laces, straps, or other fasteners to adjust the fit of the upper around the foot. A bottom portion of the upper, proximate to a bottom surface of the foot, attaches to the sole structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sole structures generally include a layered arrangement extending between a ground surface and the upper. One layer of the sole structure includes an outsole that provides abrasion-resistance and traction with the ground surface. The outsole may be formed from rubber or other materials that impart durability and wear-resistance, as well as enhance traction with the ground surface. Another layer of the sole structure includes a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper. The midsole provides cushioning for the foot and may be partially formed from a polymer foam material that compresses resiliently under an applied load to cushion the foot by attenuating ground-reaction forces. The midsole may additionally or alternatively incorporate a fluid-filled bladder to increase durability of the sole structure, as well as to provide cushioning to the foot by compressing resiliently under an applied load to attenuate ground-reaction forces. Sole structures may also include a comfort-enhancing insole or a sockliner located within a void proximate to the bottom portion of the upper and a strobel attached to the upper and disposed between the midsole and the insole or sockliner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Midsoles employing fluid-filled bladders typically include a bladder formed from two barrier layers of polymer material that are sealed or bonded together. The fluid-filled bladders are pressurized with a fluid such as air, and may incorporate tensile members within the bladder to retain the shape of the bladder when compressed resiliently under applied loads, such as during athletic movements. Generally, bladders are designed with an emphasis on balancing support for the foot and cushioning characteristics that relate to responsiveness as the bladder resiliently compresses under an applied load</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The drawings described herein are for illustrative purposes only of selected configurations and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an article of footwear in accordance with principles of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top exploded view of a sole structure of the article of footwear of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a bottom exploded view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side view of the article of footwear shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a lateral support of the sole structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of a lateral support of the sole structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view of a sole structure in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure for use with the article of footwear of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a bottom view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> taken along Line <b>9</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> taken along Line <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> taken along Line <b>11</b>-<b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> taken along Line <b>12</b>-<b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sole structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> taken along Line <b>13</b>-<b>13</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Corresponding reference numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Example configurations will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Unlike conventional sole structures formed of a unitary midsole having a unitary outsole attached thereto, the midsole <b>202</b> is formed compositely and comprises a plurality of subcomponents for providing zonal cushioning and performance characteristics. For example, the midsole <b>202</b> includes a foam element <b>206</b>, a cushioning arrangement or cushions <b>208</b>, and a lateral support <b>210</b>. The subcomponents <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of the midsole <b>202</b> are assembled and secured to each other using various methods of bonding, including adhesively bonding and melding, for example. As described in greater detail below, the outsole <b>204</b> is overmolded onto the subcomponents <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> of the midsole <b>202</b>, whereby the midsole <b>202</b> defines a profile of the ground-engaging surface <b>30</b> of the footwear <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The foam element <b>206</b> may be formed of a resilient polymeric material, such as foam or rubber, to impart properties of cushioning, responsiveness, and energy distribution to the foot of the wearer. The foam element <b>206</b> may independently be formed from a single unitary piece of resilient polymeric material, or may be formed of a plurality of elements each formed of one or more resilient polymeric materials. For example, the plurality of elements may be affixed to each other using a fusing process, using an adhesive, or by suspending the elements in a different resilient polymeric material. Alternatively, the plurality of elements may not be affixed to each other, but may remain independent while contained in one or more structures forming the cushioning element. In this alternative example, the plurality of independent foam elements may be a plurality of foamed particles, and may contained in a bladder or shell structure. As such, the foam element may be formed of a plurality of foamed particles contained within a relatively translucent bladder or shell formed of a film such as a barrier membrane.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Example resilient polymeric materials for the foam element may include those based on foaming or molding one or more polymers, such as one or more elastomers (e.g., thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)). The one or more polymers may include aliphatic polymers, aromatic polymers, or mixtures of both; and may include homopolymers, copolymers (including terpolymers), or mixtures of both.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some aspects, the one or more polymers may include olefinic homopolymers, olefinic copolymers, or blends thereof. Examples of olefinic polymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, and combinations thereof. In other aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more ethylene copolymers, such as, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, EVOH copolymers, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene-unsaturated mono-fatty acid copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more polyacrylates, such as polyacrylic acid, esters of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylic acetate, polymethyl acrylate, polyethyl acrylate, polybutyl acrylate, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyvinyl acetate; including derivatives thereof, copolymers thereof, and any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In yet further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more ionomeric polymers. In these aspects, the ionomeric polymers may include polymers with carboxylic acid functional groups, sulfonic acid functional groups, salts thereof (e.g., sodium, magnesium, potassium, etc.), and/or anhydrides thereof. For instance, the ionomeric polymer(s) may include one or more fatty acid-modified ionomeric polymers, polystyrene sulfonate, ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more styrenic block copolymers, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene acrylonitrile block copolymers, styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymers, styrene ethylene butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene ethylene propylene styrene block copolymers, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more polyamide copolymers (e.g., polyamide-polyether copolymers) and/or one or more polyurethanes (e.g., cross-linked polyurethanes and/or thermoplastic polyurethanes). Examples of suitable polyurethanes include those discussed below for barrier layers. Alternatively, the one or more polymers may include one or more natural and/or synthetic rubbers, such as butadiene and isoprene.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The foam element <b>206</b> may be formed by a polymeric material that may be foamed using a physical blowing agent which phase transitions to a gas based on a change in temperature and/or pressure, or a chemical blowing agent which forms a gas when heated above its activation temperature. For example, the chemical blowing agent may be an azo compound such as adodicarbonamide, sodium bicarbonate, and/or an isocyanate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some configurations, the foamed polymeric material may be a cross-linked foamed material. In these configurations, a peroxide-based crosslinking agent such as dicumyl peroxide may be used. Furthermore, the foamed polymeric material may include one or more fillers such as pigments, modified or natural clays, modified or unmodified synthetic clays, talc glass fiber, powdered glass, modified or natural silica, calcium carbonate, mica, paper, wood chips, and the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The resilient polymeric material may be formed using a molding process. In one example, when the resilient polymeric material is a molded elastomer, the uncured elastomer (e.g., rubber) may be mixed in a Banbury mixer with an optional filler and a curing package such as a sulfur-based or peroxide-based curing package, calendared, formed into shape, placed in a mold, and vulcanized.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another example, when the resilient polymeric material is a foamed material, the material may be foamed during a molding process, such as an injection molding process. A thermoplastic polymeric material may be melted in the barrel of an injection molding system and combined with a physical or chemical blowing agent and optionally a crosslinking agent, and then injected into a mold under conditions which activate the blowing agent, forming a molded foam.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, when the resilient polymeric material is a foamed material, the foamed material may be a compression molded foam. Compression molding may be used to alter the physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness and/or durometer) of a foam, or to alter the physical appearance of the foam (e.g., to fuse two or more pieces of foam, to shape the foam, etc.), or both.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The compression molding process desirably starts by forming one or more foam preforms, such as by injection molding and foaming a polymeric material, by forming foamed particles or beads, by cutting foamed sheet stock, and the like. The compression molded foam may then be made by placing the one or more preforms formed of foamed polymeric material(s) in a compression mold, and applying sufficient pressure to the one or more preforms to compress the one or more preforms in a closed mold. Once the mold is closed, sufficient heat and/or pressure is applied to the one or more preforms in the closed mold for a sufficient duration of time to alter the preform(s) by forming a skin on the outer surface of the compression molded foam, fuse individual foam particles to each other, permanently increase the density of the foam(s), or any combination thereof. Following the heating and/or application of pressure, the mold is opened and the molded foam article is removed from the mold.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the foam element <b>206</b> extends from a first end <b>212</b> at the anterior end <b>18</b> of the footwear <b>10</b> to a second end <b>214</b> at the posterior end <b>20</b> of the footwear <b>10</b>.
