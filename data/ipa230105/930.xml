id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to compositions for use in treating or preventing mastitis, for example sub-clinical mastitis, in a subject. In particular, the invention relates to the use of fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 18:3 n-3 octadecatrienoic acid (alpha-linolenic acid) in combination with a specific probiotics <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT-5716; in treating or preventing mastitis, in particular sub-clinical mastitis.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">WHO recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health and continued breast feeding until 2 years of age. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant receives only breast milk (no other liquids or solids are given&#x2014;not even water&#x2014;with the exception of oral rehydration solution, or drops/syrups of vitamins, minerals or medicines). WHO also recommends early initiation of breastfeeding as this may is critical to newborn survival and to establishing breastfeeding over the long term.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland tissue, which can be classified as sub-clinical or clinical depending on the degree of inflammation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mastitis may occur at any time during lactation and is experienced by up to about 33% of lactating women. Occurrence is particularly prevalent during the second and third week post-partum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) is an inflammatory condition of the lactating breast that is understood to be caused by milk stasis and/or infection, and has been associated with elevated risk of lactation failure and poor infant weight gain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><i>Staphylococcus </i>infections, in particular <i>S. aureus </i>and <i>S. epidermidis </i>infections, are understood to be a primary cause of mastitis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mastitis can result in curtailment or even lack of initiation of breast-feeding of an infant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the composition of breast milk may change during mastitis, for example increasing in content of sodium and inflammatory mediators, which may adversely affect the nutrition provided to the infant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current treatment of mastitis typically involves the administration of antibiotics. However, wide-spread use of antibiotics presents several challenges, including ineffectiveness due to antibiotic resistance, the creation of multiple-antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, the formation of biofilms, vaginal candidiasis and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, it has been indicated that there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis (Jahanfar, S. et al. (2013) Cochrane Database Syst Rev 28: CD005458).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, there is a significant need for improved methods of treating and preventing mastitis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There is a need to identify and provide solutions for preventing and treating mastitis in a &#x201c;low-impact way&#x201d;, especially in populations that can be fragile or not enable to tolerance drug intervention such as pregnant or lactating women</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventors have surprisingly found that a number of components in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis, such a n-3 fatty acids (and/or minerals such as iron, manganese and magnesium), are present at abnormal concentrations.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Concentrations of sodium and potassium in milk are commonly used in the diagnosis of sub-clinical mastitis. For example, a number of studies have found that Na:K ratios in the milk of healthy women at 1 month post-partum generally average 0.6 or less. This corresponds to average human milk sodium and potassium concentrations ranging between 5-6 mmol/L and 13-14 mmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the mean sodium concentration in mastitis milk is greater than 16 mmol/L. Accordingly, a Na:K ratio of less than or equal to 0.6 is considered to be normal; a Na:K ratio of greater than 0.6 but less than or equal to 1.0 is considered to be moderately raised; and a Na:K ratio of greater than 1.0 is considered to be greatly raised.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another study suggests that a normal drop in [Na+] is highly predictive of successful lactation, although a prolonged elevation of [Na+] signifies impaired lactogenesis with a high risk of failure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventors have studied the concentrations of additional components in the milk of women with Na:K ratios greater than 0.6 and compared these to the concentrations found in the milk of normal women. Compositional differences have been identified in a number of minerals.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, the inventors have found that women with sub-clinical mastitis have: higher concentrations of minerals such as iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, zinc and selenium; and lower concentrations of n-3 fatty acids (eg DHA) and/or minerals such as calcium and phosphorous in their milk in comparison to normal women.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inflammatory state associated with sub-clinical mastitis alters the levels and ratios of fatty acids in milk. In particular, the inventors have discovered that fatty acid concentrations vary in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis. For example, the inventors found that the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 18:3 n-3 octadecatrienoic acid (alpha-linolenic acid) are present at lower concentrations in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis in comparison to normal women. The inventors also found higher n-6:n-3 ratios and higher arachidonic acid (ARA):DHA ratios in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis in comparison to normal women.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The higher n-6:n 3 ratio, ARA:DHA ratio and lower amounts of DHA all point towards a pro-inflammatory state.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Supplementation with n-3 fatty acids, such as DHA and alpha-linolenic acid, may therefore also be used in treating or preventing the sub-clinical mastitis in a similar manner to that disclosed below with respect to minerals such as calcium and phosphorous. The inventors have found that combining the anti-inflammatory/immune benefits of n-3 fatty acids (and/or the cited minerals) with a particular probiotic (e.g <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT-5716) may boost the effect on mastitis and/or sub-clinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The minerals that exhibit lower concentrations in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis (e.g. calcium and phosphorous) correlate with deficiencies that may be causing or contributing to the sub-clinical mastitis. Supplementation with such n-3 fatty acids (eg DHA or alpha-linolenic acid) and/or minerals may therefore prevent or treat the sub-clinical mastitis, especially when further combined with probiotics. In addition, the minerals with higher concentrations in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis (e.g. iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, zinc and selenium) correlate with the natural use of such minerals in countering infection and/or inflammation. Supplementation with such minerals may therefore be beneficial to the natural fight against infection and inflammation, thereby preventing or treating the sub-clinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Without wishing to be bound by theory, this rationale is supported by the knowledge that selenium improves antibacterial activity in milk and that selenium supplementation improves symptoms associated with mastitis in cows; similarly, copper and zinc have also been shown to reduce mastitis symptoms in cows and to enhance the immune system (O'Rourke, D. (2009) Irish Veterinary Journal 62 Supplement: 15-20).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inventors believe that the elevated mineral concentrations observed in their data may result from increased uptake or hyper-accumulation from serum as part of host defence mechanisms to combat inflammation, which is consistent with roles for, for example, iron manganese and magnesium in immune function and countering inflammation (Rahmani, S. et al. (2015) J Nutr Food Sci 5: 1; Son, E. W. et al. (2007) Arch Pharm Res 30: 743-749; Maggini, S. et al. (2007) Br J Nutr 98 Suppl 1: S29-35; Tam, M. et al. (2003) Eur J Clin Nutr 57: 1193-1197; Kim, D. J. et al. (2010) Diabetes Care 33: 2604-2610; King, D. E. et al. (2005) J Am Coll Nutr 24: 166-171; Song, Y. et al. (2007) Am J Clin Nutr 85: 1068-1074).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The role of certain dietary minerals in prevention of subclinical mastitis (for example iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, calcium and phosphorus) has been also confirmed by the inventors in the experiments described in Example 2.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the inventors have discovered that alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin and albumin are present at higher concentrations in the milk of women with sub-clinical mastitis in comparison to normal women. Supplementation with these proteins may therefore also be used in treating or preventing the sub-clinical mastitis in a similar manner to that disclosed herein with respect to minerals such as iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, zinc and selenium.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a mineral selected from the group consisting of iron, manganese, magnesium, and a combination of two of more thereof, for use in treating or preventing mastitis in a subject, in combination with <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT-5716 and/or a n-3 fatty acid such as DHA or alpha-linolenic-acid</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another aspect, the invention provides iron, in combination with <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT-5716 and/or a n-3 fatty acid such as DHA or alpha-linolenic-acid, for use in treating or preventing mastitis in a subject, preferably wherein the iron is in a combination with manganese and/or magnesium.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect, the invention provides iron, in combination with <i>L. fermentum </i>CECT-5716 and/or a n-3 fatty acid such as DHA or alpha-linolenic-acid, for use in treating or preventing mastitis in a subject, wherein the iron is administered to the subject with manganese and/or magnesium.

Sub-clinical mastitis is a form of mastitis characterised by reduced milk secretion and a high milk bacterial count in the absence of evident inflammatory changes, including pain (Fernandez, L. et al. (2014) Beneficial Microbes 5: 169-183).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Concentrations of sodium and potassium in milk are commonly used in the diagnosis of sub-clinical mastitis. For example, a number of studies have found that Na:K ratios in the milk of healthy women at 1 month post-partum generally average 0.6 or less. This corresponds to average human milk sodium and potassium concentrations ranging between 5-6 mmol/L and 13-14 mmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the mean sodium concentration in mastitis milk is greater than 16 mmol/L. Accordingly, a Na:K ratio of less than or equal to 0.6 is considered to be normal; a Na:K ratio of greater than 0.6 but less than or equal to 1.0 is considered to be moderately raised; and a Na:K ratio of greater than 1.0 is considered to be greatly raised.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Mastitis may occur at any time during lactation and is experienced by up to about 33% of lactating women. Occurrence is particularly prevalent during the second and third week post-partum.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Sub-clinical mastitis (SCM) is an inflammatory condition of the lactating breast that is understood to be caused by milk stasis and/or infection, and has been associated with elevated risk of lactation failure and poor infant weight gain.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127"><i>Staphylococcus </i>infections, in particular <i>S. aureus </i>and <i>S. epidermidis </i>infections, are understood to be a primary cause of mastitis.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Mastitis can result in curtailment or even lack of initiation of breast-feeding of an infant. Furthermore, the composition of breast milk may change during mastitis, for example increasing in content of sodium and inflammatory mediators, which may adversely affect the nutrition provided to the infant.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Mineral</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one aspect, the invention provides a mineral selected from the group consisting of iron, manganese, magnesium, and a combination of two of more thereof, for use in treating or preventing mastitis in a subject.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one embodiment, the mineral is in combination with one or more further minerals selected from the group consisting of copper, zinc, selenium, calcium and phosphorus.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The minerals may be used in any form suitable for ingestion by animals, preferably humans (e.g. are non-toxic).

This collected single full breast milk samples were mixed and an aliquot of 10-40 mL HM for each time point was collected. For colostrum, or the first time point 5-10 mL was collected. The remainder of the HM was returned to the mother for feeding to the infant at a later time point, if so required. Each collected HM sample was transferred to freezing tubes, labelled with subject number and collection information, stored at &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. in the home freezer, transferred to the hospital for storage at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. and then shipped on dry ice to the Nestle Research Centre (Lausanne, Switzerland) where it was stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until analysis.

Population</heading><p id="p-0266" num="0264">This study used data from &#x2018;ATLAS&#x2019;, a longitudinal, observational study across seven European countries between December 2012 and January 2016. The study was approved by the institutional and local ethical boards for each center and was registered at ClincalTrials.gov with identifier NCT01894893. Maternal and infant demographics, anthropometry, and medical history were collected by trained and certified research nurses and assistants.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">Human milk was collected from 305 women in 7 European countries. Of those, 185 provided information on dietary intake. 8 women were further excluded due to missing information, resulting in a final sample size of 177 women. Written informed consent was obtained from all women in their respective local languages.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">SCM Analysis</heading><p id="p-0268" num="0266">Milk samples were obtained using an electric breast pump (Medela Symphony, Switzerland) from the same breast throughout the study period, at 11:00 h&#xb1;2:00 h to avoid circadian influence. Samples were first frozen at &#x2212;18&#xb0; C. until delivery to the Nestle Research Centre (Lausanne, Switzerland) and then at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for further analysis.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0267">SCM was assessed in early lactation, at visits 1 (0-3 days postpartum), 2 (17 days postpartum&#xb1;3 days), and 3 (30 days postpartum&#xb1;3 days). SCM was defined as having a sodium potassium ratio (Na/K) in breastmilk higher than 0.6 at any of the three visits. Moderate SCM was defined as Na/K ratio between &#x3e;0.6 and 1 while severe SCM as Na/K ratio&#x3e;1.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="2">Dietary Intake Data</heading><p id="p-0270" num="0268">Dietary intake was assessed with 3-day food diaries at visits 2 (V2) and 3 (V3). The dietary information was then translated to nutrient and food group intakes by Nutrilog using the French food group classification and nutrient composition database (CIQUAL).</p><p id="p-0271" num="0269">Diets which contained less than 1074.8 kcal or more than 4776.9 kcal of energy were considered outliers and were removed. After removing the outlier diets from the dataset, we considered each visit in V2-V3 in turn and the subset of subjects who attended that visit. For each visit, we removed a subject and all associated dietary information from a given visit if fewer than two non-outlier diets were reported for that subject across the three-day survey period for that visit. For example, if a subject S1 attended visit V2 and reported one outlier diet and one non-outlier diet for that visit, then we removed S1 and all her reported diets for V2 from the dataset. 177 subjects who attended at least one visit were retained for analysis.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0270">Once the mean daily consumption was calculated, it was then normalized by the mean daily energy intake for that visit in kcal/day. This adjusted consumption was then averaged over all visits that each individual subject attended within the subset. As a final step, we then performed normalization to zero mean and standard deviation of 1. An example pipeline for a subject who attended all visits in S2 (visits V2-V3)</p><p id="p-0273" num="0271">Dietary reference values for nutrients intake for lactating women were extracted from European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)'s summary report on Dietary Reference Values for nutrients.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="2">Statistical Analysis</heading><p id="p-0274" num="0272">1) We used multivariable regression to examine the association between nutrient intake in relation to SCM. Wilcox-test was used to calculate the p-values.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0273">Analyses were run with R.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0274">Results are reported in Table 4.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0275">2) We also used multivariable regression to examine the association between nutrient intake in relation to SCM. The statistical model has SCM status, Country and Mode of Delivery as covariates and contrast estimates were calculated to show the differences between SCM group and the No SCM group. A logarithmic transformation was applied as the nutrient intake data generally has a skewed distribution.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0276">Analyses were run with the statistical software R ver 3.2.1 and packages mass and contrast were used for modelling and estimation.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0000">Results are reported in Table 5.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">Results</heading><p id="p-0280" num="0277">Table 4 reports the median intake of certain nutrients for women with SCM (i.e. those with human milk sodium potassium (Na/K) ratio&#x3e;0.6 during any of the following visits: days 2, 17, and 30), and for women with no SCM (i.e. those with no SCM are defined as having a Na/K ratio &#x2264;1.6 during any of the following visits: days 2, 17, and 30).</p><p id="p-0281" num="0278">These data show that in the group of women with subclinical mastitis certain minerals (namely iron, manganese, magnesium, copper, calcium, phosphorous) were present at lower amounts in the diet as compared to the diet of women not having subclinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0279">Similarly, data show that in the group of women with subclinical mastitis certain vitamin E was present at lower amounts in the diet as compared to the diet of women not having subclinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0280">Table 5 reports the median intake of zinc and selenium for women with SCM (i.e. those with human milk sodium potassium (Na/K) ratio&#x3e;0.6 during any of the following visits: days 2, 17, and 30), and for women with no SCM (i.e. those with no SCM are defined as having a Na/K ratio &#x2264;1.6 during any of the following visits: days 2, 17, and 30).</p><p id="p-0284" num="0281">These data show that in the group of women with subclinical mastitis certain minerals in addition to those previously mentioned (namely zinc and selenium) were present at lower amounts in the diet as compared to the diet of women not having subclinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0282">These findings thus provide additional evidence that supplementation of one or more of such nutrients in the diet can prevent and/or treat subclinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0000"><tables
