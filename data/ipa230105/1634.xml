Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for manufacturing a three-dimensional object from particulate material and a method thereof, capable of improving thermal control.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In three-dimensional printing technology, three-dimensional objects can be formed in a layer-wise manner using known methods or processes of manufacturing, such as selective laser sintering, selective laser melting, electron beam melting and high speed sintering. In these processes, layers of particulate material are successively spread on a build bed surface of a build bed, and portions of successive layers are selectively solidified to form the layers of the three-dimensional object. Each layer of particulate material is selectively fused, sintered or melted by applying energy, heat or radiation, so that layer-by-layer the three-dimensional object is formed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During a typical build process, the temperature of the build bed and temperature of the components within the work space is prone to fluctuate, for example due to one or more of (a) a sintering lamp being applied intermittently across the build bed surface, leading to hot and cold periods; (b) a new (cooler) layer of particulate material being applied; (c) a preheat lamp being applied intermittently across the build bed surface; and (d) carriages on which a powder distribution device, printheads or lamps are mounted, comprising a hot surface and also shielding the build bed surface intermittently from an overhead heater, passing across the build bed surface. While such an overhead heater may be used to dynamically compensate for such thermal fluctuations, it cannot actively cool the build bed surface, and an additional level of thermal control is desirable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Insufficient temperature control may lead to a lack of control of the build bed temperature which may result in warpage, shrinkage or curling of the three-dimensional object due to thermal effects. Therefore, to control the temperature of the layer and/or build bed surface and in turn to control the temperature of the build bed, it is desirable to remove excess heat from the apparatus in which the three-dimensional object is being built.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, by-products such as airborne particles, smoke, dust or fumes may be formed in a work space during the three-dimensional printing process, and it is desirable to remove these from the work space so as to avoid their build up within the work space environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects of the invention are set out in the appended independent claims, while particular embodiments of the invention are set out in the appended dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following disclosure describes, according to a first aspect of the invention, an apparatus for manufacturing a three-dimensional object from particulate material, the apparatus comprising: a work space bounded by a first side wall on a first side of the work space, and a second side wall on a second side of the work space, the first side wall opposing the second side wall; a build bed having a build bed surface, the build bed surface being comprised in the floor of the work space and having a first edge on the first side of the work space, towards the first side wall, and a second edge on the second side of the work space, towards the second side wall; a first gas inlet at or near the first side wall; a second gas inlet at or near the second side wall; a first gas outlet above the floor of the work space, the position of the first gas outlet being coincident with the first edge of the build bed surface, or between the first edge of the build bed surface and the first gas inlet; and a second gas outlet above the floor of the work space, the position of the second gas outlet being coincident with the second edge of the build bed surface, or between the second edge of the build bed surface and the second gas inlet; wherein the first gas outlet is positioned higher in the work space than the first gas inlet, and the second gas outlet is positioned higher in the work space than the second gas inlet; and wherein one or more flow devices are operable to create first and second gas flows between the first gas inlet and the first gas outlet, and between the second gas inlet and the second gas outlet, respectively, such as to create respective first and second gas curtains on the first and second sides of the work space in use.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">By virtue of the above arrangement of the first and second gas inlets and the first and second gas outlets, and as a consequence of the first and second gas curtains thus created on either side of the work space (the first and second gas curtains being outward from, or potentially aligned with, the first and second edges of the build bed surface), improved thermal control may be achieved during the manufacture of three-dimensional objects within the work space.

Improved efficiency of removal of airborne species (e.g. particles, chemical substances, impurities such as evaporating fluid agent, smoke, fumes, exhaust gases, etc.) from the apparatus may also be achieved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By way of an initial overview, the present disclosure provides apparatus comprising a first gas inlet and a second gas inlet, respectively on first and second sides of the work space, away from the build bed surface; and first and second gas outlets above the floor of the work space, respectively on the first and second sides of the work space, and positioned such that they are closer to the build bed surface than to the first and second gas inlets when viewed from above. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which shows a plan view of the work space <b>100</b>, first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B, and first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B, looking down from above.

The gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B and the gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are arranged with respect to the build bed surface such that the distance &#x201c;d<b>1</b>&#x201d; is greater than distance &#x201c;d<b>2</b>&#x201d; (i.e. d<b>1</b>&#x3e;d<b>2</b>). Further, the first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B may be coincident with respective first and second sides <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B of the build bed surface <b>160</b> (i.e. such that d<b>2</b>=0), or may be located between the respective first and second sides <b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B of the build bed surface <b>160</b> and the respective first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B (i.e. such that 0&#x3c;d<b>2</b>&#x3c;d<b>1</b>). In such arrangements, the gas flow is not directed at the build bed surface <b>160</b>, preventing direct impact of gas flow on the build bed surface <b>160</b> and hence avoiding any resulting thermal non-uniformities. However, the gas flow assists in cooling the build bed surface <b>160</b> and removing any airborne species.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the present apparatus and method ensure that the gas flow or a ventilation flow passes across the work space before the flow is extracted, particularly engaging with hot areas of the work space and removing heat from them.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Apparatus Overview</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a front view of an apparatus <b>1</b> for the manufacture of three-dimensional objects. The apparatus <b>1</b> is operable to fabricate three-dimensional objects from a particulate material, and includes a supply module <b>110</b> for storing the particulate material, a work space <b>100</b> bounded by a first side wall <b>100</b>A on a first side of the work space <b>100</b>, a second side wall <b>100</b>B on a second side of the work space <b>100</b> (the second side opposing the first side), a floor <b>100</b>C on a bottom side of the work space <b>100</b> and a ceiling <b>100</b>D on a top side of the work space <b>100</b>. The apparatus <b>1</b> further comprises a work surface <b>190</b> comprising a build bed surface <b>160</b> provided at the top of a build bed <b>170</b> which is within a build chamber <b>200</b> wherein successive layers of the three-dimensional object are formed; a distribution sled <b>130</b> operable to distribute a layer of particulate material within the build bed surface <b>160</b>; and one or more radiation source assemblies such as overhead radiation source assembly <b>150</b> and/or a traversing radiation source assembly (not shown), such as an electromagnetic radiation source assembly to preheat and/or to sinter the particulate material or alternatively a laser source (not shown), to sinter the particulate material to form each layer of the object. The work space <b>100</b> includes the work surface <b>190</b>, the distribution sled <b>130</b>, the build bed surface <b>160</b> and the overhead radiation source assembly <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The apparatus <b>1</b> may be a high speed sintering apparatus, and may further comprise a print sled operable to print (by means of one or more droplet deposition heads) a fluid pattern comprising radiation absorbing material (RAM) to define the cross-section of the three-dimensional object to be manufactured in that layer of particulate material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the distribution sled <b>130</b> comprises bearings mounted on rails <b>120</b>. The rails <b>120</b> suspend the sled <b>130</b> above the work surface <b>190</b> of the apparatus <b>1</b>. The overhead radiation source assembly <b>150</b>, such as a ceramic heater, may be provided above the build bed surface <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The apparatus <b>1</b> further comprises a first gas inlet <b>101</b>A at or near the first side wall <b>100</b>A, a second gas inlet <b>101</b>B at or near the second side wall <b>100</b>B, and a first gas outlet <b>102</b>A and a second gas outlet <b>102</b>B above the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that the first side wall <b>100</b>A and the second side wall <b>100</b>B are depicted in the figures as being the side walls of a housing defining the work space, but this is merely for illustrative purposes and for ease of understanding the invention. The invention is not limited to this, and the first side wall <b>100</b>A and/or the second side wall <b>100</b>B may instead be partial or full walls arranged inwardly from the walls of the housing itself. Moreover, the first side wall <b>100</b>A and/or the second side wall <b>100</b>B may be hollow walls and the first and/or second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be formed within those hollow walls.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the expression &#x201c;at or near&#x201d; in this disclosure should be interpreted broadly, to encompass all possible arrangements of the gas inlets in proximity to the side walls. For example, the gas inlet could be &#x201c;at&#x201d; the side wall&#x2014;e.g. the gas inlet may protrude as a nozzle from the side wall, or may be provided as a nozzle between the side wall and the ceiling of the work space. Alternatively, the gas inlet(s) may be &#x201c;in&#x201d; the side wall&#x2014;for example, the gas inlet may be an opening or hole in the side wall. In a further alternative, the gas inlet may be &#x201c;near&#x201d; the side wall&#x2014;for example, the gas inlet may be an outlet of a flexible or a rigid pipe or tube which may be suspended from the ceiling of the work space near the side wall, or may be otherwise positioned between the side wall and the ceiling of the work space.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To illustrate this, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>h</i>)</figref> depict cross-sectional views of the first side <b>100</b>A of the work space, and illustrate various possible arrangements and geometries of the gas inlet <b>101</b>A. It should of course be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>h</i>)</figref> depict only one side of the work space; the other side of the work space may be (but need not be) a mirror image of the shown side of the work space. The first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B may have any of the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)-(<i>h</i>)</figref>, or variants thereof. Both the outlets may have the same configuration, or may have different configurations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In more detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> shows a gas inlet <b>101</b>A as an aperture or a hole in the side wall <b>100</b>A. Alternatively, the or each gas inlet may comprise a nozzle at the side wall. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>f</i>)</figref> depict a gas inlet <b>101</b>A as a nozzle protruding from the first side wall <b>100</b>A into the first side of the work space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one variant the gas inlet <b>101</b>A may be directed horizontally, parallel to the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, so that the gas flow enters the work space parallel to the build bed surface.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another variant, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be angled downwards, towards the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b>, so as to direct the gas flow such that the gas flow is deflected by the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b> towards the first gas outlet <b>102</b>A and the second gas outlet <b>102</b>B respectively. This may be advantageous as the gas flow is projected towards the floor of the work space, thereby covering, before extraction, a greater distance at the level of the build bed surface than with the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, thereby more effectively extracting heat from the work space.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another variant, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>d</i>)</figref>, the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be angled upwards towards the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b>, so as to direct the gas flow more directly towards the first gas outlet <b>102</b>A and the second gas outlet <b>102</b>B, thereby directing the gas flow towards hot areas of the work space <b>100</b>. Such hot areas may for example be the ceiling of the work space, the areas within the work space where the radiation source assembly is located (e.g. on sleds), or the areas within the work space which may be more likely impacted by heat or may be more prone to generated heat within the work space.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In variants where the first and/or second gas inlet is configured as a nozzle or a pipe, the nozzle or the pipe may be adjustably mounted, to enable the user to select the angle of the first and/or second gas inlet and thus the angle at which the gas flow will initially be directed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In both the above arrangements of the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, the first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B may be angled such that the gas flow between the inlets and the outlets is as smooth as possible, with a non-turbulent overall line of gas flow.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be appreciated that the shape of the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B is not limited to being circular. Instead, they may have any other shape, e.g. hexagonal, square, rectangular, tetragonal, polygonal etc. For example, the gas inlet may be conical and may have a tapered inlet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>e</i>)</figref> such that it spreads out the gas flow as it enters the work space. Alternatively the gas inlet may have an asymmetric shape, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>f</i>)</figref>, or the gas inlets may for instance be elongate slots. Moreover, the first and second inlets may be of any size&#x2014;and may be the same size or different sizes as required. Further, the gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B and/or the gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B may be of similar or dissimilar geometries.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other variants the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may comprise an elongated nozzle, a tube or a pipe through which gas may enter the work space. For example, the gas inlet <b>101</b>A may be an elongate nozzle arranged between the side wall <b>100</b>A and the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>g</i>)</figref>, or the gas inlet <b>101</b>A may be a flexible or a rigid pipe that may be suspended from the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>h</i>)</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>3</b>(<i>h</i>)</figref> are only examples illustrating different types of inlet or outlet geometry (in all cases with the inlet <b>101</b>A being &#x201c;at or near&#x201d; the side wall <b>100</b>A), and an appropriate inlet or outlet geometry can be chosen according to the work space dimensions and design. Further, one or more gas outlets may be arranged at a right angle, an acute angle or an obtuse angle with respect to the ceiling of the work space. For example, the outlet could face sidewards towards the side wall comprising the respective gas inlet, or alternatively sidewards towards the opposite side wall of the work space.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in an example process sequence, at the start of a cycle, a layer of particulate material is distributed on the build bed surface <b>160</b> by the distribution sled <b>130</b>. Any excess particulate material is fed into a return outlet <b>180</b> to recirculate into the system or to collect in an external container. A fluid such as radiation absorbing material (RAM) is then deposited onto the layer of particulate material by a print sled (not shown), to define the cross-section of the three-dimensional object <b>300</b> to be manufactured in that layer, and the build bed surface <b>160</b> is then exposed to radiation from a radiation source assembly to sinter the powder. Following sintering, the build bed surface <b>160</b> is lowered by a layer thickness; this is considered to be the end of the cycle. The next cycle begins with depositing another layer of the particulate material on the build bed surface <b>160</b>, and the process is repeated until the desired three-dimensional product has been fabricated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Implementations</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic cross section of a build bed and a work space of an apparatus such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Providing independent flow devices in this manner may be useful to compensate for any asymmetry in the convection or to compensate for any asymmetry in the thermal process. For example, to compensate for thermal asymmetry, the gas flow rate or gas flow speed at one of the flow devices <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B may be altered or modified such that the resulting heat convection is the same on both sides of the work space. Furthermore, separate or independent flow devices may be used to create a differential flow in the two parts of the work space, on either side of the intersection A-A&#x2032;.

The gas flow from the inlets to the respective outlets may be set up so that first and second gas curtains on the first and second sides of the work space <b>100</b> create three separate pressure zones within the work space <b>100</b>: two outer pressure zones between each gas inlet and the respective gas outlet, and an inner/central pressure zone above the build bed surface <b>160</b>. The gas curtains may be set up effectively by controlling the flow rate at the gas outlets and by arranging the gas outlets e.g. in the form of elongate slots located above either side of the work space <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an upward flow of gas on either side of the work space <b>100</b> that has a significant vertical component in the direction of the natural convection flow. It thus enhances the natural convection flow that is set up by the hot build bed surface <b>160</b>. Within the inner pressure zone, the pressure is lower than in the two outer pressure zones, and due to a fast upward flowing component an upward flow is set up in the inner pressure zone next to each curtain.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The generated three pressure zones may be used to remove excess heat from the work space <b>100</b> and also to remove impurities or chemical substances such as evaporating fluid agent, smoke, fumes, exhaust gases and airborne particles from the work space <b>100</b>. The central pressure zone may experience an updraft along the convection direction thereby enhancing the natural flow of convection.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The properties of the two outer gas flows and the resulting gas curtains need not be of the same shape or flow rate, and depend on the work space design and the respective rates of extraction and flow resistances set up by the inlet and outlet and the intervening flow path.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, the first gas flow F<b>1</b> may create a first gas curtain on the first side of the work space <b>100</b> and a first pressure zone outward of the first edge <b>160</b>&#x2032; of the build bed surface <b>160</b>, and the second gas flow F<b>2</b> may create a second gas curtain on the second side of the work space and a second pressure zone outward of the second edge <b>160</b>&#x2033; of the build bed surface <b>160</b>. In some implementations, the first pressure zone and the second pressure zone may have substantially the same pressure. This may ensure that symmetry is maintained within the work space and thus any thermal non-uniformities may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thus, due to the generation of the first and second gas curtains on the first and second sides of the work space <b>100</b>, first and second pressure zones may be created outward of the first and second edges of the build bed surface <b>160</b>, and a central pressure zone may be created above the build bed surface <b>160</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The central pressure zone may have a pressure lower than the first pressure zone and the second pressure zone. The gas flow in the central region of the build bed surface <b>160</b> may have a low flow rate and small volume so as to avoid impact of a downward gas flow on the build bed surface <b>160</b> strong enough to cause temperature depressions and disturbance of the layer of particulate material.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, the one or more flow devices may be used to control the gas flow rate or suction speed at the gas outlet. For example, the one or more flow devices may be configured to control the flow rate of the gas flow such that each pressure zone has a different pressure, or the first and second zones may have the same pressure. As discussed above, the one or more flow devices may comprise a suction device that is coupled to both or each of the first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, such that the first and second gas curtains may be created by operating the one or more suction devices to apply suction to the first and second gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B.

Instead, any external source of suction (such as a factory vacuum device) or any known internal source of suction may be used and may be coupled to the gas outlet, for example by a suitable length of tube.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Central Gas Duct</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In another implementation, a central pressure zone may be created by injecting a downward flow of low pressure gas into the work space <b>100</b> and may be provided to the build bed surface <b>160</b>. The temperature of this gas may be lower than the temperature of the gas provided by the first and second gas inlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. The downward gas flow may be adjusted so as to create a small downward flow of gas to the build bed surface <b>160</b>.

To provide this downward flow of gas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>1</b> may further comprise a gas duct <b>103</b>A above the build bed surface <b>160</b> and one or more inflow devices may be arranged to create a downward flow of low pressure gas from the gas duct <b>103</b>A towards the build bed surface <b>160</b> in use. The one or more inflow devices may adjust the downward flow so as to control the flow rate, velocity and/or volume of the gas flow. This downward flow of gas may create a central or low pressure zone above the build bed surface <b>160</b> and can also control the pressure of the central zone. The central pressure zone may be used to a small degree to cool a portion of the build bed surface to make it more uniform thermally, while avoiding generation of dust and temperature non-uniformity. The one or more inflow devices may comprise a fan or an impeller and may be controlled by the controller <b>500</b> or by a mechanical switch, lever or valve.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Sleds</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one implementation, the apparatus <b>1</b> has two sleds: a distribution sled <b>130</b> on which a distribution device such as roller may be mounted, and a print sled <b>140</b> on which droplet deposition heads may be mounted.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The two sleds <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> in parking positions on the first and second sides of the work space <b>100</b>.

Alternatively, the apparatus <b>1</b> may have a further sled (not shown) on which a radiation source assembly may be mounted.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">During the three-dimensional printing process, the sleds <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> are moved over the build bed surface <b>160</b> to perform their functions during the stages of the build process and may be affected by the heat from the nearby radiation source assembly, overhead radiation assembly or by generated heat during process within the work space. During the build process, the radiation source assembly or assemblies raise the temperature of the sled and its components and/or the nearby components at least temporarily in the vicinity of the sled. It is therefore desirable to cool the sleds <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> to avoid any negative impact of heat on their functionality, for example on the reliability of the droplet deposition heads.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Accordingly, the gas flow from the first and/or second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be directed towards the one or more sleds on which a distribution device, droplet deposition head assembly or radiation source assembly is mounted, such that the gas flow cools the one or more sleds. This means that, during operation of the apparatus, the gas flow may be at least temporarily directed towards the one or more sleds as they intermittently reside in the parking position near the gas inlet. The gas flow may be directed towards a sled in the parking position and/or along the path of travel of the sleds. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first and second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be provided at the same level above the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b> as that of the sleds, so that the gas flow impacts the sled face and is deflected so that it passes over the top surface and/or along the sides of the sled <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>. The gas flow may thus also assist in cooling of the sled <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Arrangement with Guiding Elements</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one implementation of the apparatus <b>1</b>, the apparatus may comprise one or more guiding elements <b>400</b> that may be arranged between the first and/or second gas inlet <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B and the build bed surface <b>160</b>, for guiding the gas flow from the first and/or second gas inlet <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B to the respective first and/or second gas outlet <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. One or more guiding elements may be arranged on the first and/or second sides of the work space <b>100</b>. This arrangement may reduce strong gas flow components directed towards the build bed surface <b>160</b>. Moreover, the guiding elements may direct the gas flow and define the path of the gas flow such that the temperature and velocity of the gas flow may be controlled, for example by restricting the free space into which the gas flow may otherwise disperse. The guiding elements may be arranged as a fixed structure or alternatively may be arranged as a movable structure so as to guide the gas flow as they are repositioned, for example dynamically during a build process.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, guiding elements <b>400</b><i>a</i>-<b>400</b><i>f </i>are arranged at the first and second sides of the work space <b>100</b>.

Additionally or instead, the guiding elements may be arranged so that the gas flow reaches to the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space and to the gas outlet without reaching the build bed surface. Instead of angling the inlet, a guiding element may be used to deflect the flow upon entering the working space. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the gas flows F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> are first deflected by a guiding element <b>400</b><i>e, </i><b>400</b><i>f </i>respectively located near the gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B so as to direct the gas flow towards the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b> so as to cool the hot areas of the ceiling, then the second guiding elements <b>400</b><i>a, </i><b>400</b><i>c </i>located at or near the ceiling <b>100</b>D respectively direct the gas flow towards the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b>. Next, the guiding elements <b>400</b><i>a, </i><b>400</b><i>b, </i><b>400</b><i>c, </i><b>400</b><i>d </i>located near the gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B redirect the respective gas flows F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> towards the respective gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. With this type of arrangement of guiding elements <b>400</b><i>a</i>-<b>400</b><i>f, </i>a high volume gas flow can be maintained over a defined flow path. For example, the guiding elements <b>400</b><i>e, </i><b>400</b><i>f </i>guide the gas flow such that the gas flow F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> is deflected to the ceiling of the work space to cool any hot areas in the ceiling of the work space, and then before extracting the gas flow through the gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B the gas flow F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> is deflected from the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b> to the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b> by the guiding elements <b>400</b><i>a, </i><b>400</b><i>c </i>so as to cool the build bed surface <b>160</b> and also to flow across the sleds and remove excess heat from the sled surfaces. In this way, the gas flow may be forced along a path in the work space <b>100</b> such that it passes over the hottest areas on the first and second side of the work space, before extraction.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The guiding elements may be positioned symmetrically about the section A-A&#x2032; so as to enhance gas flow symmetry on the first and second sides of the work space <b>100</b>, for example in arrangements where the rates of extraction and the respective flow paths of the first and second sides are substantially equal.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one example, the guiding element(s) may comprise one or more baffles or one or more protrusions from the side wall or from the floor of the work space. The baffles may direct the gas flow towards the respective gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. The baffles may be arranged between the first and/or second edges of the build bed surface <b>160</b> and the first and/or second gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B. Alternatively, the baffle may be arranged at or near the first and/or second gas inlet <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B. The baffle may be formed by a vertical or angled plate, with respect to the level of the build bed surface <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In another example, the guiding elements may comprise one or more valves or vanes. Optionally, there may be one or more guiding elements on each side of the work space depending on the height of the work space, the distance between gas inlet and gas outlet, the gas flow velocity, and number of elements/devices (e.g. sleds, roller, dosing blade to dose particulate material to the work surface, etc.) between the build bed surface and the side wall.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">It should be noted that the arrangement of guiding elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is for illustrative purpose only, and other arrangements may be envisaged that achieve the effect of directing the gas flow.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Furthermore, as the guiding elements restrict the path of the gas flow, they help to control the gas flow velocity by increasing the speed of gas flow for a fixed rate of suction and to increase the temperature exchange with the hotter surfaces adjacent the restricted path. Additionally, the guiding structures may be formed of thermally conductive material so as to remove heat from the gas flow as it passes.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In another implementation, the distribution sled <b>130</b> and/or the print sled <b>140</b> may function as a dynamic guiding element. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the distribution sled <b>130</b> and the print sled <b>140</b> are at the parking position, the gas flow may be deflected by the sleds <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> such that the gas flow passes over the sleds may partially be deflected to the ceiling of the work space, then flow down to the floor of the work space and be directed back by the floor of the work space and the outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B towards the ceiling.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In further implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>, the gas inlets <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B may be coupled to the gas outlets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B via a flexible tube or a pipe which may function as a guiding element to guide the gas flow. The flexible tube may be fully perforated or partially perforated, or otherwise cut away in places. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> shows the first gas inlet <b>101</b>A and the first gas outlet <b>102</b>A coupled by a partially perforated tube <b>410</b>, with the perforated part of tube <b>410</b> facing towards the build bed surface <b>160</b> such that the gas flow may enter the work space <b>100</b> closer to the build bed surface through the perforations of the tube <b>410</b> so as to cool the build bed surface <b>160</b>. The perforated part of the tube <b>410</b> may be joined to a solid part near the first gas outlet <b>102</b>A so as to guide the gas flow towards the first gas outlet <b>102</b>A.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows another variant of a flexible tube <b>420</b> in which the flexible tube incorporates a slot in the tube wall, through which slot gas may enter the work space. The first gas inlet <b>101</b>A and the first gas outlet <b>101</b>B are coupled by the slotted tube <b>420</b> and the slot faces towards the build bed surface <b>160</b> such that the gas flow may enter the work space closer to the build bed surface <b>160</b> through the slot of the tube <b>420</b> so as to cool the build bed surface <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref> depict arrangements of different flexible tubes or pipes at the first side of the work space, only for illustration. However, the second side of the work space may be a mirror-image of the first side of the work space for symmetry of the gas flow. For example, a perforated tube <b>410</b> can be used on both the first and second sides of the build bed surface <b>160</b>, or a slotted tube <b>420</b> can be used on both the first and second sides of the build bed surface <b>160</b>. Alternatively, a combination of the perforated tube <b>410</b> and the slotted tube <b>420</b> may be used in the work space <b>100</b>&#x2014;for example, the perforated tube <b>410</b> may be arranged on the first side of the work space <b>100</b> while the slotted tube <b>420</b> may be arranged on the second side of the work space <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>h</i>)</figref> above, in some variants the gas outlet <b>102</b>A may face downwards towards the floor <b>100</b>C of the work space <b>100</b> or towards the work surface <b>190</b>. In some of these variants, one or more of the gas outlets may be arranged facing downwards and towards the respective gas inlets, and the geometry of the gas outlet may depend on the geometry of the gas inlet. With these arrangements, a non-turbulent flow path may be created between the gas inlet and the respective gas outlet.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">However, in another variant as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the gas outlet <b>102</b>A may protrude from the ceiling <b>100</b>D of the work space <b>100</b> and into the work space <b>100</b>, and the gas outlet <b>102</b>A may face sidewards towards the side wall <b>100</b>B of the work space <b>100</b>. With such an arrangement on each side of the work space <b>100</b>, the flow paths on the first and second sides of the build bed surface <b>160</b> may be created such that the gas is forced towards the centre of the work space and the flow path comes close to the edge of the build bed surface <b>160</b> before exiting through the gas outlet, thus resulting in efficient cooling of the build bed surface. This arrangement leads to a more intricate flow path between the gas inlet and the respective gas outlet. For this variant, it may be advantageous to arrange the gas outlet between the gas inlet and the build bed surface (i.e. away from the edge of the build bed surface) so that the flow path will not disturb the particulate material on the build bed surface. It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the protrusion is shown with one angled side. However, the protrusion is not limited to this shape, and it may have any shape with the opening on the side facing towards the opposite side wall of the work space (i.e. towards the side wall which is opposite to the side wall comprising the respective gas inlet <b>101</b>A). Moreover, the geometry of the protrusion may be designed according to the required flow path profile.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">General Considerations</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The reference to &#x201c;gas&#x201d; in this disclosure may incorporate atmospheric air, inert gas, nitrogen, a combination of these gases, or any gas that may be compatible with the three-dimensional printing process.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It should be appreciated that even though a single gas inlet at or near the side wall of the work space has been depicted in the Figures, the invention is not limited to this and any number of gas inlets as required can be envisaged. Moreover, the gas inlets may be simple holes or apertures on the side walls of the work space, and there could be a plurality of holes of different (or same) sizes on the side walls of the work space.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, the gas may be provided to the gas inlets naturally, such that each inlet is in direct communication with the atmospheric air. Alternatively, the gas may be provided to the gas inlets using a flow device such as a fan or impeller to draw gas into the gas inlets. In another example, the gas may be delivered to the gas inlets using an external gas supply device such as a gas cylinder, with the gas being supplied from the gas cylinder to the gas inlet at elevated pressure.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Also, it should be noted that, even though a single gas outlet at one side of the work space has been depicted in the Figures, the invention is not limited to this and any number of gas outlets as required can be envisaged.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
