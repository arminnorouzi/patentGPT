Therefore, within the cell volume, both the main electrodes and the metal can be included.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0038">Currently, using carbonaceous materials of high porosity, but there is a problem of capacity loss of the devices caused by the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI).<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0039">This problem is solved by metallising the anode. To carry out this process, it is necessary to connect the anodic material with the metal through an external circuit. With the existing electrochemical cell designs, this anode metallisation must be performed at a stage outside the formation stage since, inside the cell, there is only room for two electrodes.</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0040">Furthermore, if external metallisation is required, we only need to connect the external electrical circuit to the metal and to the electrode to be metallised. This process removes the loss of capacity caused by the formation of the solid-electrolyte interface since, once this layer has been formed, the external electrical circuit connects the main electrodes to each other and begin to perform charge and discharge cycles.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">Another benefit offered by this cell design is the way the electrical current is drawn. Generally, the current collector is in contact with one end of the electrode and exits outward in a direction perpendicular to the ion flow.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">This time, the current collectors are two metal through rods that go through all the electrodes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">The collectors go in the same direction as the ion flow between anode and cathode.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">In addition, the contact between the collectors and the electrodes is individually direct with each of them ensuring even current distribution.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">This significantly decreases internal resistance and, therefore, the current drawn from the device is higher.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0046">In order to complement the description being made and in order to assist a better understanding of the features of the invention, two sheets of drawings are added to this descriptive report, as an integral part thereof, in which elements are indicated with identical references and where, including but not limited to, the following has been represented:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>&#x2014;Cut-off view of the device and its component parts</p><p id="p-0041" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>&#x2014;Isometric view of the geometric arrangement of vertically stacked electrodes, and through rods.
