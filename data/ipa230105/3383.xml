In particular, the present disclosure relates to a fuel nozzle having a nozzle tip with increased durability.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Turbomachines are utilized in a variety of industries and applications for energy transfer purposes. For example, a gas turbine engine generally includes a compressor section, a combustion section, a turbine section, and an exhaust section. The compressor section progressively increases the pressure of a working fluid entering the gas turbine engine and supplies this compressed working fluid to the combustion section. The compressed working fluid and a fuel (e.g., natural gas) mix within the combustion section and burn in a combustion chamber to generate high pressure and high temperature combustion gases. The combustion gases flow from the combustion section into the turbine section where they expand to produce work. For example, expansion of the combustion gases in the turbine section may rotate a rotor shaft connected, e.g., to a generator to produce electricity. The expanded combustion gases (i.e., exhaust gases) then exit the gas turbine via the exhaust section.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, fuel nozzles are employed in the combustion section for mixing fuel and air prior to ignition within the combustion section. As such, the fuel nozzles are generally disposed in close proximity to the high temperature combustion gases and therefore experience thermal stresses during operation of the turbomachine. Particularly, the aft ends of the fuel nozzles, which are closest to the combustion gases, experience the most thermal stress. In some operational instances, the thermal stresses can cause cracking or damage to the fuel nozzles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an improved fuel nozzle is desired in the art. In particular, an improved fuel nozzle having means for reducing or entirely preventing damage-causing thermal stresses would address long-felt needs in the industry.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects and advantages of the fuel nozzles and combustors in accordance with the present disclosure will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one embodiment, a fuel nozzle for a turbomachine is provided.

A solid aft wall is disposed at the aft end of the outer annular wall. The solid aft wall and the outer annular wall at least partially define a plenum. A nozzle portion, which is disposed within the plenum, includes an inner annular wall and an impingement wall.

The downstream portion <b>240</b> of the center body <b>202</b> may define the air plenum <b>238</b>. The partition <b>236</b> may be disposed directly between the upstream portion <b>241</b> and the downstream portion <b>240</b> such that the partition <b>236</b> forms a boundary between the fuel passage <b>212</b> and the air plenum <b>238</b> (such that no fuel enters the air plenum <b>238</b> or vice versa).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In many embodiments, the air plenum <b>238</b> may receive the air <b>28</b> from the head end volume <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) via one or more conduits <b>243</b> extending through each turning vane <b>206</b>.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;solid&#x201d; refers to a wall or walls that are impermeable, such that they do not allow air or other fluids to pass therethrough. For example, the solid aft wall <b>310</b> is not fabricated with any apertures, holes, or voids that would allow for fluid to escape or travel therethrough. In many embodiments, the solid aft wall <b>310</b> may be the aft-most portion of the nozzle tip <b>302</b>, such that the nozzle tip <b>302</b> terminates axially at the solid aft wall <b>310</b>.

In particular, the solid aft wall <b>310</b> and the outer annular wall <b>304</b> may be the outermost walls of the nozzle tip <b>302</b> and may collectively define the plenum <b>312</b>. In many embodiments, the plenum <b>312</b> may be in direct fluid communication with the center body <b>202</b> (e.g., in direct fluid communication with the air plenum <b>238</b> defined by the center body <b>202</b>). As shown, the plenum <b>312</b> may include an inlet <b>314</b> defined by the outer annular wall <b>304</b> at the forward end <b>306</b>. Additionally, the plenum <b>312</b> may include a plurality of outlets <b>316</b> defined in the outer annular wall <b>304</b>. For example, the plurality of outlets <b>316</b> may be circumferentially spaced apart from one another (e.g., equally circumferentially spaced apart), such that the outlets <b>316</b> advantageously deliver a uniform flow of fluid to the premix passage <b>208</b> upstream of the outlet <b>224</b> defined by the burner tube <b>204</b>. In exemplary embodiments, the plurality of outlets <b>316</b> may be the only means by which the nozzle tip <b>302</b> fluidly communicates with the premix passage <b>208</b>.

For example, the nozzle portion <b>318</b> may extend radially inward from the outer annular wall <b>304</b> and may at least partially co-extend axially with the outer annular wall <b>304</b>. Particularly, the nozzle portion <b>318</b> may only be connected at a first end <b>324</b> to the outer annular wall <b>304</b> but may otherwise be spaced apart from the outer annular wall <b>304</b> and suspended within the plenum <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In many embodiments, the nozzle portion <b>318</b> may include an inner annular wall <b>320</b> and an impingement wall <b>322</b>.

For example, the impingement wall <b>322</b> may be spaced apart from the solid aft wall <b>310</b> and generally parallel thereto, such that the solid aft wall <b>310</b> is uniformly cooled by impingement fluid traveling through the impingement wall <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, the impingement wall <b>322</b> may define a plurality of apertures <b>328</b> configured to direct fluid to impinge upon the solid aft wall <b>310</b>.

The discrete jets of fluid impinge (or strike) the interior surface <b>311</b> and create a thin boundary layer of fluid over the interior surface <b>311</b>, which allows for optimal heat transfer between the solid aft wall <b>310</b> and the fluid. For example, the apertures <b>328</b> may extend perpendicularly through the impingement wall <b>322</b>, such that the apertures <b>328</b> may orient pre-impingement fluid perpendicularly to the surface upon which it strikes, e.g., the interior surface <b>311</b> of the solid aft wall <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the fluid has impinged upon the interior surface <b>311</b>, it may be referred to as &#x201c;post-impingement fluid&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;spent cooling fluid&#x201d; because the fluid has undergone an energy transfer and therefore has different characteristics. For example, the spent cooling fluid may have a higher temperature and lower pressure than the pre-impingement fluid because the spent cooling fluid has removed heat from the solid aft wall <b>310</b> during the impingement process.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the nozzle portion <b>318</b> of the nozzle tip <b>302</b> separates an inlet (or pre-impingement) portion <b>330</b> of the plenum <b>312</b> from an outlet (or post-impingement) portion <b>332</b> of the plenum <b>312</b>.

In exemplary embodiments, this may be done by utilizing an additive manufacturing system and method, such as direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), direct metal laser melting (DMLM), or other suitable additive manufacturing techniques. By utilizing additive manufacturing methods, the nozzle tip <b>302</b> may be integrally formed as a single piece of continuous metal and may thus include fewer sub-components and/or joints compared to prior designs. The integral formation of the nozzle tip <b>302</b> through additive manufacturing may advantageously improve the overall assembly process. For example, the integral formation reduces the number of separate parts that must be assembled, thus reducing associated time and overall assembly costs. Additionally, existing issues with, for example, leakage, joint quality between separate parts, and overall performance may advantageously be reduced.
