id="p-0033" num="0032">For instance, if the connection object moves when the connection object and the connector are in their mated condition, a load such as stress is exerted on a movable insulator and a fixed insulator that are in mating engagement with the connection object. This makes these insulators susceptible to breakage, deformation, or other damage. Such load increases as, for example, the connector increases in length due to an increase in the number of poles. Accordingly, such a connector with a floating structure needs to be designed to mitigate this load. The design of the electrical connector described in PTL 1, however, does not give adequate consideration to a structure that allows for mitigation of the above-mentioned load.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A connector and an electronic apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure make it possible to mitigate the load that is exerted on a movable insulator and a fixed insulator of the connector having a floating structure when these insulators are in mating engagement with the connection object.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

This helps to prevent or reduce damage to these insulators such as breakage or deformation. For example, the movable insulator <b>30</b> includes the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>that are separate from each other. This helps to ensure that even if the connection object <b>60</b> moves when the connection object <b>60</b> and the connector <b>10</b> are in their mated condition, the load such as stress exerted on the movable insulator <b>30</b> that is in mating engagement with the connection object <b>60</b> is mitigated. For example, the movable insulator <b>30</b> includes the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>that are separate from each other. This helps to mitigate the load that is exerted on the fixed insulator <b>20</b> due to, for example, collision of one movable insulator <b>30</b> as the connection object <b>60</b> moves when in the mated condition. The load mitigation effect becomes greater as, for example, the connector <b>10</b> becomes longer due to an increase in the number of poles.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Moreover, the movable insulator <b>30</b> is divided into two separate parts, which means that the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>are able to move individually. This allows for improved movability of the movable insulator <b>30</b> in comparison to a case where these movable insulators are integrated with each other. Therefore, the first mating recess <b>71</b> and the second mating recess <b>72</b> of the connection object <b>60</b>, and the movable insulator <b>30</b> are easily guided toward each other. This makes it possible to achieve an improved floating structure for the connector <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The division wall <b>25</b> of the fixed insulator <b>20</b> overlaps the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the movable insulator <b>30</b> from the mating side. Accordingly, when the movable insulator <b>30</b> is about to move upward, the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>comes into contact with the division wall <b>25</b>. As a result, the movable insulator <b>30</b> does not move further upward. This prevents or reduces upward disengagement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> from the fixed insulator <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The distal end of the first protrusion of the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>is positioned further toward the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>relative to the distal end of the second protrusion of the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b</i>. This ensures that even if the division wall <b>25</b> is reduced in width in the left-right direction, the width of overlap, as viewed from the mating side, between the division wall <b>25</b> and the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>in the left-right direction is maintained. Therefore, even if the division wall <b>25</b> is reduced in width in the left-right direction to allow for increased amount of movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b>, upward disengagement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> from the fixed insulator <b>20</b> is effectively prevented or reduced.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>are arranged linearly in the direction of arrangement of the contacts <b>50</b>. This makes it possible to increase the width of the connector <b>10</b> in one direction, that is, the left-right direction, and reduce the width of the connector <b>10</b> in another direction, that is, the front-back direction.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>are identical to each other in shape. This facilitates manufacture of the movable insulator <b>30</b>. This leads to improved efficiency of production of the connector <b>10</b>, and consequently reduced manufacturing cost of the connector <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The connector <b>10</b> is designed to allow for improved signal transmission characteristics. The presence of the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>in the contact <b>50</b> of the connector <b>10</b> makes it possible to adjust the characteristic impedance in the corresponding part of the contact <b>50</b> toward an ideal value. More specifically, the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>of the contact <b>50</b> are designed to have a reduced width (reduced cross-sectional area) to allow for increased amount of elastic deformation. Accordingly, the characteristic impedance adjusted to an ideal value increases in the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>. The presence of the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>makes it possible to intentionally reduce the amount of such increase in characteristic impedance. As described above, the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>serves to reduce the amount of increase in characteristic impedance in the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>to thereby make the overall characteristic impedance closer to an ideal value. This makes it easier for the connector <b>10</b> to achieve desired transmission characteristics even in large-volume, high-speed transmissions. The connector <b>10</b> allows for improved transmission characteristics in comparison to conventional electrical connectors that do not have the adjustment portions provided in the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, the contact <b>50</b> has the first wide portion <b>51</b><i>a</i>, and the second wide portion <b>55</b>. Accordingly, the characteristic impedance is adjusted in accordance with the width of each of these transmission paths, that is, the cross-sectional area of each of these transmission paths. For example, the first wide portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the second wide portion <b>55</b> protrude in the front-back direction so as to have an increased width. This makes the characteristic impedance in the corresponding parts of the contact <b>50</b> closer to an ideal value. More specifically, the presence of the first wide portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the second wide portion <b>55</b> makes it possible to intentionally reduce the amount of increase in characteristic impedance in the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>. In this way, the characteristic impedance is adjusted by means of the first wide portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the second wide portion <b>55</b>. Accordingly, these structural portions make it possible to reduce the amount of increase in characteristic impedance in the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>to thereby make the characteristic impedance closer to an ideal value.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The contact <b>50</b> is designed such that the wide portions of the contact <b>50</b> protrude in the front-back direction. The entire shape of the contact <b>50</b> can be thus formed by blanking alone. This leads to improved efficiency of production of the contact <b>50</b>. Further, the contact <b>50</b> can be easily manufactured even if the contact <b>50</b> is designed to have a complex shape. Therefore, the contact <b>50</b> can be manufactured while maintaining its precise shape that is optimized for desired transmission characteristics. This leads to improved efficiency of production of the contact <b>50</b>, and consequently improved efficiency of production of the connector <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The first wide portion <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the second wide portion <b>55</b> are respectively contiguous with the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>. This configuration helps to increase the effect of each wide portion on the corresponding elastic portion having a comparatively small width. As a result, the characteristic impedance of each elastic portion is reduced more effectively. This effectively reduces the amount of increase in characteristic impedance in each elastic portion.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As described below, the connector <b>10</b> makes it possible to achieve an improved floating structure, in addition to the improved signal transmission characteristics mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The contact <b>50</b> of the connector <b>10</b> has the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>. This allows for increased amount of movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b>. More specifically, due to the elastic deformation of the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>in addition to the elastic deformation of the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the amount of possible movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The contact <b>50</b> of the connector <b>10</b> further has the third elastic portion <b>56</b>. This allows for increased amount of movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b>. More specifically, due to the elastic deformation of the third elastic portion <b>56</b> in addition to the elastic deformation of each of the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>, the amount of possible movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The movable insulator <b>30</b> has the wall <b>36</b> positioned to face the second wide portion <b>55</b>. This prevents or reduces contact between the pair of contacts <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> that are arranged symmetrically to each other in the front-back direction. As described above, the second wide portion <b>55</b>, which connects the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>and the third elastic portion <b>56</b>, moves in, for example, the front-back direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> as the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>and the third elastic portion <b>56</b> deform elastically. At this time, if the movable insulator <b>30</b> does not have the wall <b>36</b>, the respective second wide portions <b>55</b> of the pair of contacts <b>50</b> at the front and back may come into contact with each other depending on the respective elastic deformation states of the above-mentioned elastic portions.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The presence of the wall <b>36</b> prevents or reduces such contact between the second wide portions <b>55</b>, and consequently prevents or reduces electrically-induced failures such as short-circuiting and mechanically induced failures such as breakage. In other words, the presence of the wall <b>36</b> in the connector <b>10</b> helps to restrict excessive elastic deformation of the third elastic portion <b>56</b>. This allows the connector <b>10</b> to maintain its reliability as a product, even in situations where the second wide portion <b>55</b> moves as the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>and the third elastic portion <b>56</b> deform elastically.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the first adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> protrudes one step further outward in the front-back direction relative to the second adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>, and the third adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>3</b> protrudes one step further inward in the front-back direction relative to the second adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>. This design ensures that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, even if the contact <b>50</b> elastically deforms, neither the first adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> nor the third adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>3</b> comes into contact with other parts of the contact <b>50</b> or with the movable insulator <b>30</b>. The above configuration of the connector <b>10</b> ensures that the respective protrusions of the first adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the third adjustment portion <b>54</b><i>b</i><b>3</b> do not hinder elastic deformation of the contact <b>50</b>. This allows for smooth movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b>, which contributes to an improved floating structure.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>extend from opposite ends of the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>in the mating direction. This allows the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>to be able to move by a required amount. Therefore, the connector <b>10</b> allows the movable insulator <b>30</b> to move by a required amount. The connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b</i>, and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>are formed integrally in the shape of a crank. In addition to providing the above-mentioned effect, this configuration also contributes to reducing the width of the connector <b>10</b> in the front-back direction illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>extends from the inner end at the upper edge of the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b</i>, and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>extends from the outer end at the lower edge of the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b</i>. The above configuration leads to reduced overall width of the connector <b>10</b> in the front-back direction. Additionally, the above configuration makes it possible to, within the limited area inside the fixed insulator <b>20</b>, increase the length of the elastically deformable part of each of the first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c</i>. This leads to an improved floating structure.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The first elastic portion <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the intermediate portion <b>54</b><i>b</i>, and the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>are positioned in this order in the mating direction from the mating side. Accordingly, the second wide portion <b>55</b> connected to the second elastic portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>is located at the lowermost position. This configuration allows the third elastic portion <b>56</b> to be extended for increased elastic deformation. This allows for increased amount of movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the contact <b>50</b> has the notch <b>57</b>. This helps to mitigate the force that, in response to movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b>, acts on the third locking portion <b>58</b> that is in contact with the inner wall of the movable insulator <b>30</b>. Likewise, the connector <b>10</b> is designed to mitigate the force that acts on the elastic contacting portion <b>59</b> located in an upper part of the contact attachment groove <b>35</b>. The connector <b>10</b> is designed to allow the third elastic portion <b>56</b> to deflect in a part of the third elastic portion <b>56</b> below the vicinity of the notch <b>57</b>. More specifically, the connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the third elastic portion <b>56</b> undergoes a greater amount of elastic deformation in the lower half part than in the upper half part that extends from the lower end of the third locking portion <b>58</b> to the vicinity of the notch <b>57</b>. In this way, with the third locking portion <b>58</b> in secure locking engagement with the movable insulator <b>30</b> and with the elastic contacting portion <b>59</b> in secure contact with the contacting portion <b>92</b>, the third elastic portion <b>56</b> can contribute to the movement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The contact <b>50</b> is made of a metallic material with a small elastic modulus. The connector <b>10</b> thus ensures that the movable insulator <b>30</b> is able to move by a required amount with the application of even a small amount of force to the movable insulator <b>30</b>. The movable insulator <b>30</b> is capable of smooth movement relative to the fixed insulator <b>20</b>. This allows the connector <b>10</b> to easily absorb misalignment that may occur during mating of the connector <b>10</b> with the connection object <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The connector <b>10</b> is designed such that the elastic portions of the contact <b>50</b> absorb potential vibrations caused by some external factor. This reduces the risk of a large force being applied to the mounting portion <b>53</b>. Consequently, damage to the connecting part between the mounting portion <b>53</b> and the circuit board CB<b>1</b> is prevented or reduced. This helps to prevent or reduce cracking of the solder at the connecting part between the circuit board CB<b>1</b> and the mounting portion <b>53</b>. Therefore, when the connector <b>10</b> and the connection object <b>60</b> are in their connected state, the reliability of the connection improves.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The contact <b>50</b> has the second wide portion <b>55</b> with an increased width. This helps to facilitate the assembly of the connector <b>10</b>. More specifically, the increased width of the second wide portion <b>55</b> leads to increased rigidity of the second wide portion <b>55</b>. This allows the contact <b>50</b> to be inserted from below the fixed insulator <b>20</b> and the movable insulator <b>30</b> by means of an assembling device or other device, with the second wide portion <b>55</b> serving as the point of support.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The metal fitting <b>40</b> is press-fit into the fixed insulator <b>20</b>, and the mounting portion <b>41</b> is soldered to the circuit board CB<b>1</b>. This configuration allows the metal fitting <b>40</b> to securely fix the fixed insulator <b>20</b> to the circuit board CB<b>1</b>. The metal fitting <b>40</b> helps to improve the strength with which the fixed insulator <b>20</b> is mounted to the circuit board CB<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be implemented in predetermined manners other than the embodiment described above, without departing from the spirit and essential features of the present disclosure. The foregoing description, therefore, is intended to be illustrative rather than limiting. The scope of the present disclosure is defined not by the foregoing description but by the appended claims. The scope of the present disclosure is to be construed to cover all such modifications that may fall within the scope of its equivalents.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">For example, the shapes, the arrangements, the orientations, and the numbers of individual structural features described above are not limited to those described above and illustrated in the drawings. The shapes, the arrangements, the orientations, and the numbers of the individual structural features may be determined as desired as long as the intended functions of such structural features can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The connector <b>10</b> and the connection object <b>60</b> may not necessarily be assembled by the method described above. The connector <b>10</b> and the connection object <b>60</b> may be assembled by any method that allows the respective functions of the connector <b>10</b> and the connection object <b>60</b> to be achieved. For example, at least one of the metal fitting <b>40</b> and the contact <b>50</b> may be formed integrally with at least one of the fixed insulator <b>20</b> and the movable insulator <b>30</b> by insert molding, rather than press-fitting.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Although the connector <b>10</b> has been described above as having two movable insulators <b>30</b> including the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b</i>, the number of movable insulators <b>30</b> is not limited to two. Alternatively, the connector <b>10</b> may have three or more movable insulators <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Although it has been described above that the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>protrudes toward the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>from a side near the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and that the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>protrudes toward the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>from a side near the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a</i>, this is not intended to be limiting. Alternatively, for example, the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the movable insulator <b>30</b> may protrude outward from at least one of the front and back surfaces of the bottom portion <b>31</b> of the movable insulator <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Although it has been described above that the division wall <b>25</b> of the fixed insulator <b>20</b> overlaps the first protrusion and the second protrusion from the mating side, this is not intended to be limiting. Alternatively, for example, the metal fitting <b>40</b> may be attached to the division wall <b>25</b>, and the metal fitting <b>40</b>, rather than the fixed insulator <b>20</b>, may overlap the first protrusion and the second protrusion from the mating side. More specifically, the retaining portion <b>43</b> of the metal fitting <b>40</b> may overlap the first protrusion and the second protrusion from the mating side. This allows the retaining portion <b>43</b> to prevent or reduce upward disengagement of the movable insulator <b>30</b> from the fixed insulator <b>20</b>. Similarly, the division wall <b>25</b> of the fixed insulator <b>20</b>, and the retaining portion <b>43</b> of the metal fitting <b>40</b> may both overlap the first protrusion and the second protrusion from the mating side.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Although it has been described above that the distal end of the first protrusion is positioned further toward the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>relative to the distal end of the second protrusion, this is not intended to be limiting. Alternatively, for example, the distal end of the first protrusion may be positioned further toward the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>relative to the distal end of the second protrusion. At this time, the bottom portion <b>31</b> of the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a</i>, that is, the right side of the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a</i>, and the bottom portion <b>31</b> of the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b</i>, that is, the left side of the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>may face each other.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Although it has been described above that the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>are disposed linearly in the direction of arrangement of the contacts <b>50</b>, this is not intended to be limiting. The first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be disposed inside the fixed insulator <b>20</b> in any desired positional relationship. For example, the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in the front-back direction such that the front and back surfaces of the movable insulators <b>30</b> face each other. At this time, the protrusion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the movable insulator <b>30</b> may protrude from at least one of the front and back surfaces of the bottom portion <b>31</b> of the movable insulator <b>30</b>.

Alternatively, the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be different from each other in shape. For example, the first movable insulator <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second movable insulator <b>30</b><i>b </i>may have different lengths in the mating direction in which the connection object <b>60</b> and the movable insulator <b>30</b> are mated to each other.
