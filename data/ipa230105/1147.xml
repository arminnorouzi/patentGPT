Aspects of the disclosure relate to medical systems, devices, and methods for endoscopic medical procedures, such as manipulating and cutting tissue with one or more medical devices during resection and dissection procedures, among other aspects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wide variety of medical techniques and instruments have been developed for diagnosis and/or treatment within a patient's body, such as within a patient's gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Endoscopic sub-mucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic sub-mucosal resection (ESR), mucosal resection (EMR), polypectomy, mucosectomy, etc., are minimally invasive treatment methods for both malignant and non-malignant lesions. Endoscopic medical procedures, such as, for example, ESR, may be used to excise sessile adenomas or other unwanted tissue (e.g., tumors attached to a bodily surface) from the surface of an anatomical lumen (e.g., stomach, esophagus, colon, etc.). Such procedures often require multiple endoscopic instruments for the resection of tissue. In some instances, a grasper is used with either a cautery knife or snare during such medical procedures, for resecting tissue from a treatment site. However, many conventional graspers operate in only one degree of freedom, and deflection of the grasper (or another end effector) is often limited and/or dependent on the tip deflection of an endoscope or other device used for insertion into the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, deflecting and/or repositioning the grasper or other end effector relative to the treatment site may require the user to deflect and/or reposition the endoscope relative to the treatment site, which may affect the visualization of the treatment site. These concerns may increase the duration, costs, and risks of the medical procedure. The systems, devices, and methods of this disclosure may rectify some of the deficiencies described above or address other aspects of the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of the disclosure relate to, among other things, systems, devices, and methods for performing one or more medical procedures with the medical systems and devices.
