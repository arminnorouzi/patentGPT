First, a VTOL aircraft will require significantly more installed power (given by the rated power of the installed engines, drive motors, batteries, and drivetrain) than a CTOL aircraft because it takes significantly more power for a VTOL aircraft to hover than for a CTOL aircraft to take off via runway. The increased installed power drives the aircraft to a higher weight and cost, limiting the usefulness of the vehicle. For some powertrain configurations, such as battery&#x2014;only power sources, a feasible design may not be possible for certain VTOL configurations using present&#x2014;day component technology due to limits in battery and motor power density.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Second, VTOL aircraft are typically louder than CTOL aircraft of the same size, particularly during takeoff and landing. This also reduces the usefulness of VTOL aircraft as the acoustic signature can lead to public annoyance resulting in operational limitations placed on vehicle use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Finally, VTOL safety records lag the rest of aviation. VTOL aircraft, and in particular helicopters, typically have one or more single points of failure in their rotor and powertrain systems. As a result, helicopters often recover from a propulsion system failure through an autorotation landing in which a high level of pilot skill is required in order to control a benign, but immediate landing; however, such a landing is problematic in the dense urban areas where VTOL aircraft provide the greatest operational advantage in terms of landing site flexibility.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A new class of VTOL aircraft, often electric-powered &#x201c;eVTOL&#x201d; aircraft, has emerged to address these shortcomings. US20180334251A1 (Karem), incorporated herein by reference, surveys the prior art. The prior art has many vehicles that use five or more rotors in VTOL flight, some of which are able to continue safe operation after a single rotor system failure. However, vehicles with more rotors will necessarily have smaller diameter rotors with a lower overall vehicle rotor disk area to fit in the same footprint, and therefore will have higher disk loading (weight divided by total rotor disk area). This will lead to increased noise and decreased aircraft power loading (thrust divided by power required) in vertical takeoff. Lower power loading will reduce the usefulness of the vehicle&#x2014;lower power loading will increase the energy consumed by an aircraft and increase the required capacity of the powertrain. A large number of rotors also leads to either many exposed lift rotors in forward flight, which reduces lift to drag ratio and thus speed and range, or requires a large number of tilting rotors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Karem addresses such power loading and noise issues by introducing vehicles with two to four flight-critical rotor systems; a four-rotor embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such vehicles tend to have lower disk loading within a given footprint (due to the larger possible rotor diameters) and thus gain power loading and noise advantages; however, these vehicles are less safe due to single points of failure in the rotor system. Vehicles such as Karem's attempt to increase safety through redundant motors, batteries, or engines, but will still have single points of failure in the gear reduction system and rotor control system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional prior art attempts to address the hover power loading and noise disadvantages of VTOL aircraft via multiple co-rotating coaxial rotors; indeed, the noise and power loading advantages of coaxial rotors are known. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, U.S. Pat. No. 8,640,985 discloses an aircraft with two rotor stacks, each stack having two rotor systems. The rotor systems in each stack are fixed relative to each other, and not independently rotatable, and driven around a common axis for increased aircraft level power loading and reduced noise. However, in each of the coaxial stacks, the rotors are unable to rotate independently of each other.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, US20190135413A1 discloses an aircraft with six stacks of two small, co-rotating propellers for noise reduction and increased power loading. The two propellers in each of the coaxial stacks can move relative to each other to adjust the azimuth angle for optimal noise and power loading characteristics. While this design includes independent rotation for real-time tailoring of azimuthal spacing between propeller, it does not appear to contemplate oversizing each rotor system to enable flight with one of the two rotors of a rotor stack inoperative. Moreover, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not think to oversize the rotors in the aircraft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The relatively small diameter and greater number of rotors makes oversizing of thrust capacity in each rotor less advantageous, as the aircraft has a large number of backup propellers if one should fail.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows Airspace Experience Technology's MOBI-ONE, a tilt-wing aircraft with eight small rotors arranged in four co-rotating coaxial stacks of two rotors each. The coaxial stacks tilt with the wing. The vehicle features a ninth, aft auxiliary rotor for pitch control. While the total of four coaxial stacks and a fifth auxiliary rotor allows for continued flight with one coaxial stack inoperable, the increased number of rotor stacks necessarily forces the rotors to be smaller, leading to a higher disk loading and the resulting low power loading experienced by VTOL aircraft using several small rotors.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> show Embraer's PULSE concept, a tiltrotor aircraft with four rotors arranged in two tilting coaxial rotor stacks. Here, the coaxial design provides for reduced noise and increased power loading relative to two tilting single rotors, but the relatively small rotors are sized to fit inside of the closed wing, which results in lower power loading relative to aircraft with larger tilting rotors. The PULSE concept discloses a hover rotational speed of the rotors as approximately 850 RPM, which follows the conventional wisdom that a rotor should turn fast enough to avoid a gearbox. Conventional wisdom in urban aerial mobility also teaches that rotor tip speed should be below 450 feet per second in hover to control noise, which would result in a rotor of approximately 10 feet diameter. At this rotor size, it appears to the present applicant that disk loading will be high (likely 30 pounds per square foot or more), which would make a vehicle with a powertrain sized to provide all of the thrust required by the vehicle through only one of each rotor in a coaxial stack unlikely. Thus, it also appears that while an aircraft of the PULSE concept might be able to land safely in the event that one rotor on each side was rendered inoperable, the aircraft would not be able continue along a normal flight plan, including for example vertical takeoff.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> Shows a VTOL aircraft with four coaxial stacks of two rotors each for a total of eight rotors. In each coaxial stack, the rotors are counter-rotating allowing for torque control of the aircraft. However, this vehicle also uses a large number of small rotors in line with the prevailing wisdom. It may be that the aircraft is able to cut power to one rotor from each coaxial stack and descend benignly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the Joby six rotor VTOL. The prevailing wisdom would suggest the design has the nicety of reliability afforded by having many rotors dispersed about the aircraft. A person of ordinary skill would not think to reduce the number of Joby's rotors because the large number of rotors would require only a 150% propulsion system oversizing to accommodate a situation for the case in which a rotor system fails, and an opposite rotor system is also shut down to compensate torque and moment balance. Modifying a Joby type aircraft to have significantly fewer, but larger, rotors would also be against the prevailing wisdom because one of ordinary skill would think that doing so would preclude the presumed additional reliability afforded by many rotors. Such a VTOL aircraft is also against the prevailing wisdom of existing vehicles with two tilting rotors or coaxial rotor stacks, which rely on the vehicle having high enough reliability in a single point of failure rotor system to ensure safety.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a drawing of a prior art four rotor embodiment of a vehicle with two to four flight-critical rotor systems.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a prior art aircraft.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an aircraft with six stacks of two small, co-rotating propellers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows Airspace Experience Technology's MOBI-ONE, a tilt-wing aircraft with eight small rotors arranged in four co-rotating coaxial stacks of two rotors each.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows Embraer's&#x2122; PULSE concept, a tiltrotor aircraft with four rotors arranged in two tilting coaxial rotor stacks.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows an alternate view of Embraer's&#x2122; PULSE concept, a tiltrotor aircraft with four rotors arranged in two tilting coaxial rotor stacks.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a VTOL aircraft with four coaxial stacks of two rotors each for a total of eight rotors.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the Joby&#x2122; six rotor VTOL.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of a VTOL aircraft in hover according to the inventive concepts herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective view of preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, but shown in transition.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, but shown in cruise position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a possible embodiment of drive system <b>900</b> for a two-rotor co-axial stack.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a possible alternate embodiment of drive system <b>900</b> for a two-rotor co-axial stack.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows another possible alternate embodiment of drive system <b>900</b> for a two-rotor co-axial stack.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a possible alternate embodiment of drive system <b>900</b> for a two-rotor co-axial stack.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows one possible embodiment of a drive system reverser.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> an embodiment in which a first wing is configured to pivot relative to main body of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an embodiment of the aircraft that comprises at least a first auxiliary rotor system in addition to the first and second coaxial rotor stacks.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows an embodiment of an aircraft configured with four variable pitch rotors; the aircraft is shown in transition.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> shows an embodiment of an aircraft configured with four variable pitch rotors; the aircraft is shown in hover.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows an embodiment of an aircraft configured with four variable pitch rotors; the aircraft is shown in cruise position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the aircraft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a top view of an embodiment of an aircraft configured with four variable pitch rotors.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a possible gear reduction system, nacelle, and motor configuration that may be used.

It is against prevailing wisdom to size each rotor system (including the associated gear reduction systems, engines, motors, and batteries) in a coaxial stack to provide all of the thrust needed for controlled flight without the other rotor (for example, in an aircraft with only two coaxial rotor stacks), as this would result in a more than 200% oversizing of the rotor system to both compensate for the lost thrust of the second rotor and to overcome the additional inefficiencies of an inoperable rotor in the rotor slipstream. Designers using a coaxial rotor system for increased power loading would not size each rotor system in a coaxial rotor set to be both independently driven and capable of providing all of the thrust needed out of the set with one rotor inoperative due to the increased weight and complexity of the system. A coaxial rotor set of a certain diameter and solidity uses less overall power to achieve a given thrust than a single rotor of the same diameter and solidity would use for the same thrust. Additionally, the power and torque required by each rotor system in a coaxial set is approximately half of the overall rotor system power; this means a coaxial rotor set design&#x2014;such as some of the designs implemented in some embodiments herein&#x2014;would defeat the POSITA's perceived advantage of using coaxial rotors for decreasing the power required. Oversizing rotor systems to enable VTOL flight with one rotor inoperable requires far more installed power&#x2014;not less&#x2014;than a single rotor system.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">What the prior art does not teach is a VTOL aircraft with fewer than five rotors&#x2014;either stacked into two primary coaxial rotor stacks or otherwise implemented&#x2014;with low overall disk loading, sized and dimensioned such the aircraft is able to take off and land safely in a controlled manner even where a complete rotor system is inoperable. Such an approach is contrary to the prevailing wisdom, which teaches that system redundancy requires numerous rotors, typically five or more, to accommodate controlled VTOL flight after a complete rotor system failure or that system redundancy is weight prohibitive and the vehicle design instead assumes at least one rotor or drive system is flight critical, requiring a component-level reliability of approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>failures per flight hour which, assuming feasible, would increase manufacturing and maintenance costs.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments presented herein, a VTOL aircraft has four primary rotors&#x2014;arranged in two primary coaxial rotor stacks or otherwise implemented&#x2014;designed and sized for redundancy of each rotor system. Such a design may replace critical rotor systems with coaxial rotor sets, each of which has two or more independently-driven rotor systems. Other embodiments may utilize non-coaxial rotor systems in which the four primary rotors are arranged in a quad configuration.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With regards to coaxial implementations, unlike prior art coaxial rotors which are designed primarily for anti-torque (no tail rotor), high-speed edgewise advance ratio, or increased power loading, some embodiments described herein provide coaxial rotor sets that are designed for redundancy and safety. Specifically, each coaxial rotor set is designed such that each of the individual rotor systems in the set are independently driven and are capable of providing all of the thrust required from the flight-critical coaxial rotor set for controlled VTOL flight, including takeoff.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some coaxial embodiments, the rotor systems are driven by torque-producing sources (most likely motors or engines); the design may have either a large excess of installed power if each torque-producing source can drive only one of the rotors, or the system is so designed such that each motor or engine can drive either one rotor or the other depending on failure mode. The gear reduction systems and motors or engines driving each rotor are also sized to provide sufficient power for a single rotor in a stack to provide all of the thrust needed from the complete stack. If the aircraft is battery-powered, the battery system architecture provides sufficient battery power to the motors or other torque-producing devices driving the operable rotors. Further, the aircraft has a method of balancing aircraft yaw moment when one of the rotor systems in a coaxial set is inoperable. In some embodiments, the method may involve shutting down a rotor system in one or more of the other coaxial rotor sets, varying the speed and collective in the other coaxial rotor sets to vary the yaw moment contribution of each, applying differential rotor nacelle tilt angles to generate offsetting yaw moment, or other methods.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some of the inventive concepts disclosed herein achieve the increased levels of safety required for aerial transport of people and cargo without the typical trade-offs of high disk loading or increased rotor counts; such approaches allow for large-diameter rotors without making these rotors and associated drivetrains safety-critical.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Particular embodiments of the invention disclosed herein may provide apparatus, systems and methods in which an electric powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is engineered to carry at least 400 pounds (approximately 181 kg) using two coaxial rotor stacks, each stack comprised of two variable pitch rotor systems axially aligned about a substantially common axis of rotation with each variable pitch rotor being independently driven by preferably one or more electric motors, but potentially any other torque-producing device such as a fuel-consuming engine. In one embodiment, each variable pitch rotor system is preferably a variable speed rigid (non-articulated) rotor. Additionally, the rotors are preferably tiltrotors&#x2014;configured to remain axially aligned to each other while tilting relative to the main body. One or more of the rotors provides a significant amount of lift during rotor borne flight (e.g., vertical takeoff, etc), and can be tilted to provide forward thrust (or air braking) during wingborne flight. For clarity&#x2014;in some embodiments&#x2014;the relative azimuthal angle between the two variable pitch rotor systems in a coaxial stack is not fixed; each variable pitch rotor system is able to rotate about the substantially common axis of rotation independent of the other variable pitch rotor system. To the extent that the rotors tilt, both variable pitch rotor systems are configured to tilt together. The variable pitch rotor may comprise a first blade, wherein the flap stiffness of the first blade in the variable speed variable pitch rotor in lbs-in{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}2 at 30% of rotor root radius is at least 200 times the rotor diameter in feet to the fourth power such as the rotor taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,365 (Karem), incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the variable pitch rotor is configured to operate at an RPM level less than 80% or even 60% of a maximum rotor system RPM level.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Some embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are contemplated especially for aircraft engineered to carry at least 400 pounds, which is approximately the payload capability needed to carry more than one human or an equivalent amount of other payload. VTOL aircraft are subject to square-cube scaling laws in which an aircraft that is dimensionally scaled to a larger size by a scale factor will experience weight growth by approximately the cube of the scale factor while rotor areas, wing areas, structural spar depths (which provide strength and stiffness) and other such parameters will only increase by approximately the square of the scale factor. The results are three-fold. First, the necessary structural strength, stiffness, and aeroelastic margins will become harder to maintain at larger scales. Second, the power required to hover, which already grows super-linearly with aircraft weight at a given rotor disk area, will also grow super-linearly as the vehicle's overall size grows; this means the power margins needed for propulsive redundancy grow unfavorably with size. The result is that design techniques employed in toys and smaller aircraft, particularly those designed to carry the equivalent of fewer than two humans, are not particularly predisposed to working for larger aircraft where power needs and design complexity are much higher. The inventive concepts contained herein may be particularly well suited to address the needs of aircraft capable of carrying more than 400 lbs.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of a VTOL aircraft in hover. The aircraft has a main body <b>1101</b>, inboard wing <b>1102</b>, tilting nacelle <b>1106</b>, tilting outboard wing <b>1107</b>, first coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b>, and first tail surface <b>1108</b>. The outboard wing <b>1107</b> tilts with the tilting nacelle <b>1106</b> to reduce download force from the rotor in hover mode. The first coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b> comprises a first variable pitch rotor system <b>1104</b> and a second variable pitch rotor system <b>1105</b> rotatable about a substantially common axis of rotation&#x2014;the rotors' axis of rotation&#x2014;with each of the rotor systems being independently driven by at least one torque-producing source. The first and second variable pitch rotors may be configured to be co-rotating or counter-rotating.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">This embodiment additionally comprises a second coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b>. The second coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b> comprises a first variable pitch rotor system <b>1104</b> and a second variable pitch rotor system <b>1105</b> rotatable about a substantially common axis of rotation&#x2014;the rotors' axis of rotation&#x2014;with each of the rotor systems being independently driven by at least one torque-producing source.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">First variable pitch rotor system <b>1104</b> includes rotor blades <b>1109</b>. The rotor blades are of a stiff, hingeless variety, including for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,365 (Karem). Each variable pitch rotor system independently provides thrust and force moments controlled by rotating the blades about a feather axis such as for the rotor system described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,351,235 (Karem), incorporated herein by reference; an electronic control system <b>1411</b> simultaneously controls both the rotational speed and rotor blade pitch for each variable pitch rotor system to both trim the rotor forces and moments according to the electronic flight control system, and to ensure the rotor operates at an optimum speed for optimal blade lift distribution, and hence, optimal efficiency and minimum required rotor torque applied by the torque-producing devices, as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,365. Inboard wing <b>1102</b> transmits loads from the coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b> and outboard wing <b>1107</b> to the main body <b>1101</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each of the first and second variable pitch rotor systems in each of the coaxial rotor stacks is able to provide sufficient thrust such that the aircraft is capable of controlled vertical takeoff and landing, even if up to one of the variable pitch rotor systems of each of the coaxial rotor stacks is inoperable. This requires that the total thrust needed from each coaxial stack, inclusive of additional rotor inefficiencies due to the inoperable rotor in the slipstream, can be provided by a single rotor. To calculate the total required thrust, one would consider the maximum gross weight of the aircraft and then use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods to calculate the additional thrust needed to overcome airframe download due to the wing, main body, nacelles, tail, and inoperable rotors that may influence the rotor wake. One would further add additional thrust margin for controllability and maneuverability in the one rotor inoperable condition; in the preferred embodiment, such thrust margin may exceed 15%. One would then use CFD methods to calculate the rotor input torque and power needed to achieve the necessary thrust, including margin, in the desired operating conditions including air density and climb rate in the one rotor inoperable case. This required rotor torque would further be used to size the torque and power ratings for each element in the powertrain including the gear reduction system, torque-producing devices, and power distribution system (including batteries for embodiments in which the torque-producing devices are electric motors); the power and torque ratings for each powertrain element would further account for the efficiency losses in each element of the powertrain system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the first variable pitch rotor system <b>1104</b> and second variable pitch rotor system <b>1105</b> in a coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b> may also be sized such that each of the first and second variable pitch rotor systems can provide all of the thrust commanded by the electronic flight control system for the entire coaxial rotor stack, even if one rotor is inoperable. To accomplish this, the electronic control system may command an increased RPM and power for the operable variable pitch rotor. The increased RPM and power for the required thrust margin are calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods for the particular rotor configuration, including the presence of the inoperable rotor, when sizing the rotor with the result validated by the physical rig testing of the combination of rotors, nacelle, and adjacent wing surfaces. In flight, the commanded RPM, blade pitch, and power is commanded by the electronic flight control system based on measured feedback of the aircraft's linear and angular velocity and acceleration for all three axes. The torque-producing devices and gear reduction systems (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b></figref>) are similarly sized with sufficient margin for the one rotor inoperative case. If the aircraft is battery-powered, then the battery and distribution system would be sized to provide sufficient power to the operable rotors in each inoperable rotor scenario. Such sizing would occur at maximum gross takeoff weight at the highest pressure altitude desired for operation at a sufficient vertical rate of climb, typically greater than 100 feet per minute, along with additional margin for control power, cross wind, and trim penalty as dictated by the desired flight envelope.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The main body <b>1101</b> is designed to carry payload such as passengers, luggage, or cargo and contains various systems including a landing gear in configurations such as those described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 10,351,235 (Karem), incorporated herein by reference. In the preferred embodiment, the offset of the vehicle center of gravity from the center of the coaxial rotor stacks is controlled by mast moment from the rigid variable pitch rotor systems, which necessarily requires rotor cyclic control.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one exemplary embodiment, the aircraft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 6,000 lb. The aircraft has one pilot seat and four passenger seats, as well as a luggage hold. The aircraft's main body is 33 ft in length with a 5.0 ft maximum width and a 5.5 ft maximum height. The aircraft's wingspan is 45 ft and the spanwise distance between the two coaxial rotor stack centers is 30 ft. The variable pitch rotor systems in the left and right coaxial rotor stacks have a diameter of 21 ft for a non-overlapping rotor disk area of 693 ft<sup>2 </sup>and a disk loading of 8.7 lb/ft<sup>2 </sup>based on the fully non-overlapping area and 4.3 lb/ft<sup>2 </sup>based on total overlapping disk area. Each variable pitch rotor system is driven by four motors through a single speed gear reduction system; in hover during nominal operating conditions, the motor input speed is 10,000 RPM and the variable pitch rotor system output speed is 400 RPM. However, any number of electric motors could be configured to drive each variable pitch rotor system through the gear reduction system, for example one, or two, or three. Each motor preferably has a maximum continuous power rating of 90 kW and a maximum emergency power rating of 110 kW; however, the vehicle will typically use less than half of the maximum continuous power rating in hover in most nominal operating conditions. The vehicle's sixteen motors are powered by eight batteries, each capable of outputting 120 kW.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">If one variable pitch rotor system becomes inoperable, the electronic control system may increase the speed of the remaining operable rotor to 533 RPM and increase blade pitch to maintain rotor operation near the rotor's peak efficiency thrust coefficient while providing the same thrust as in the nominal operating condition. Importantly, the motor oversizing in some embodiments described herein allows the vehicle to maintain positive performance margins in both vertical climb out of ground effect (with at least 100 ft/min climb) and control power (with at least, for example, 25% control power margin for vehicle handling in urban environments) at a pressure altitude of at least 5,000 ft. In a rotor system failure condition, the vehicle of some embodiments described herein allows the pilot to maintain controlled flight and transition to wingborne flight where much less power is required; it also allows the pilot to vertically takeoff and climb out of ground effect if required, for example in an aborted landing scenario. The same is also true if a battery pack fails when all rotors are operating nominally; one could additionally oversize the batteries to allow for combined battery and rotor-drive failures.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> show a perspective view of the preferred embodiment in transition and cruise, respectively, consistent with the aircraft represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As the tilting nacelle <b>1106</b> tilts the coaxial rotor stack <b>1103</b> about a tilt axis <b>1113</b> from a hover position with a vertical thrust vector <b>1111</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) to a cruise position with a horizontal thrust vector <b>1112</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), the outboard wing <b>1107</b> tilts from a vertical position into a horizontal position with similar angle of attack as the inboard wing <b>1102</b>. The outboard wing increases the vehicle's overall wing aspect ratio for decreased cruise drag; in the preferred embodiment, the main wing has an overall wing aspect ratio of at least 6, and preferably more than 8.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">To achieve preferred levels of safe and efficient flight in hover, transition, and cruise, aircraft contemplated herein may be designed according to the aerodynamic design teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 10,351,235 (Karem), incorporated by reference in its entirety. In such embodiments, aircraft are designed to have a low wingborne stall speed of 80 KIAS or less and preferably 60 KIAS or less; the low stall speed provides a wide transition corridor, allowing for the vehicle to tilt its rotors from hover mode to cruise mode at low airspeed. Such aircraft may also advantageously use a slotted wing flap as taught in U.S. Provisional Pat. No. 62/757,680 (Karem), incorporated herein by reference, to reduce the vehicle stall speed while providing for a wing area that is efficient in higher speed cruise. In some embodiments, the vehicles are designed to be efficient in cruise with a lift to drag ratio of at least 9 and preferably at least 13 at a cruise speed of 130 KTAS.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> show perspective views of two embodiments of integrating drive system <b>900</b> for a two-rotor co-axially rotating stack, forward rotor system <b>901</b> and aft rotor system <b>902</b> rotating about common axis <b>903</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates duplicated common assemblies, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a back-to-back motor and gear reduction system arrangement.

In such an embodiment, the drive system <b>900</b> is configured such that aft motors <b>907</b> and forward motors <b>906</b> can drive either forward rotor hub <b>904</b> or aft rotor hub <b>905</b> or both rotor hub <b>904</b> and rotor hub <b>905</b>. In such a configuration the forward hub can be driven by forward motors and aft motors without the aft hub being driven, for example if the aft reduction gear reduction system <b>908</b> is jammed. Likewise, the aft hub can be driven by forward motors and aft motors without the forward hub being driven. A clutch, such as a directional clutch <b>920</b><i>a </i>or <b>920</b><i>b</i>&#x2014;not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, can be configured such that causing the forward motors and aft motors to drive a first direction causes a first variable pitch rotor system to be driven; and causing the forward and aft motors to drive a second direction causes a second variable pitch rotor system to be driven. Such an embodiment is preferred because the installed power requirement to drive only one of the variable pitch rotor systems is reduced, as the motors can be sized such that four motors are used to drive a single operable rotor system instead two sets of motors each driving a respective motor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, some embodiments may implement motors torque connected to both rotors in a coaxial stack.

In a counter rotating embodiment for example, motor <b>906</b> may be configured to drive connecting shaft <b>919</b> a first direction.

During normal operating conditions the aft directional clutch <b>920</b><i>b </i>connected to the same forward motor <b>906</b>, would be configured to be disengaged. If the front rotor failed, forward motor <b>906</b> may reverse its direction of rotation, which would disengage the front directional clutch <b>920</b><i>a </i>and engage the aft directional clutch <b>920</b><i>b</i>. Thus, even in the instance of one rotor inoperable, all motors may be configured to generate thrust.
