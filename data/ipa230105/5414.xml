The display apparatus refers to a product with an image display function. For example, the display apparatus may be a television, a mobile phone, a computer, a notebook computer, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a vehicle-mounted computer, a display, a billboard, a digital photo frame, a laser printer with a display function, a telephone, a digital camera, a portable camcorder, a viewfinder, a monitor, a navigator, a vehicle, a large-area wall, a household appliance, or an information inquiry device (e.g., a business inquiry device or a monitor of a department such as an electronic government department, a bank, a hospital or an electric power department). The display apparatus includes a frame, and a display panel, a circuit board, a display driver integrated circuit (IC) and other electronic accessories, which are disposed in the frame.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The display panel may be a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel, a quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED) display panel, a micro light-emitting diode (including mini LED or micro LED) display panel, or the like, which is not specifically limited in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Following embodiments of the present disclosure will be described by taking an example in which the display panel is the OLED display panel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the display panel <b>100</b> has display area AA and a peripheral area BB located on at least one side of the display area AA. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an example in which the peripheral area BB surrounds the display area AA.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The display panel <b>100</b> includes sub-pixels P of a plurality of colors arranged in the display area AA. The sub-pixels of the plurality of colors include at least sub-pixels of a first color, sub-pixels of a second color, and sub-pixels of a third color. The first color, the second color and the third color are three primary colors (e.g., red, green and blue).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For convenience of description, the embodiments of the present disclosure are described by taking an example in which the plurality of sub-pixels P are arranged in a matrix. In this case, sub-pixels P arranged in a line in a horizontal direction X are referred to as sub-pixels in a same row, and sub-pixels P arranged in a line in a vertical direction Y are referred to as sub-pixels in a same column.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, each sub-pixel P is provided with a pixel circuit S (also referred to as a pixel driving circuit) therein, and the pixel circuit S includes a plurality of transistors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> showing an example in which the pixel circuit S includes two transistors). The pixel circuit is coupled to a light-emitting device L, and is used to drive the light-emitting device L to emit light. Pixel circuits S in a same row are connected (i.e., coupled) to a same gate line GL, and pixel circuits S in a same column are connected to a same data line DL. In addition, the arrangement of the plurality of sub-pixels P depends on an arrangement of pixel circuits S in the plurality of sub-pixels P, and has nothing to do with positions of light-emitting devices L in the sub-pixels P.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The transistors included in the pixel circuit S may all be N-type transistors or P-type transistors, or may include both an N-type transistor and a P-type transistor, which may be designed according to actual needs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, the pixel circuit S may include at least one of a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) transistor and an oxide transistor. For example, the transistors in the pixel circuit S may all be LTPS transistors or oxide transistors, or may include both an LTPS transistor and an oxide transistor.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, a voltage for controlling brightness of the sub-pixel will change with time due to current leakage of the transistors in the pixel circuit S. Therefore, in order to keep fluctuation of the brightness of the sub-pixel within a reasonable range, data still needs to be refreshed when a static image is displayed. In order to reduce power consumption when the static image is displayed, reducing a refresh frequency is an effective method. While the refresh frequency is reduced, a display quality also needs to be maintained, thus, it requires reducing a speed of the current leakage of the transistors in the pixel circuit S. Since oxide semiconductors have a characteristic of ultra-low current leakage, the transistors in the pixel circuit S may be provided as oxide transistors, so that the current leakage of the transistors in the pixel circuit S may be reduced during display an image by the display panel. Since a carrier mobility of LTPS transistors is high, it may be possible to greatly improve a response speed of the transistors by using the LIPS transistors in the pixel circuit S, thereby ensuring a charging speed of the sub-pixel. Moreover, for the LIPS transistors, sources and drains are formed by self-alignment through ion implantation. Therefore, parasitic capacitances generated between gates and both the sources and the drains are much smaller than those of amorphous silicon transistors, thereby greatly reducing capacitive coupling effect. In order to reduce the current leakage of the transistors in the pixel circuit, and to ensure the charging speed and the small parasitic capacitances of the sub-pixel, a low temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) process may be used in combination with advantages of the LTPS transistors and Oxide transistors. For example, the pixel circuit S includes two types of transistors, i.e., the LTPS transistor and the oxide transistor. For example, the pixel circuit S includes a P-type LIPS transistor and an N-type oxide transistor.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the display apparatus further include a gate driving circuit <b>01</b> and a data driving circuit <b>02</b>. For example, the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> may be disposed in the peripheral area BB of the display panel <b>100</b>; for example, the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> may be disposed on a side of the peripheral area BB located at ends of gate lines GL (e.g., a left side of the peripheral area BB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).

Based on this, it is possible to drive the pixel circuits S in the display panel <b>100</b>, and then to drive the light-emitting devices L to emit light, so that corresponding sub-pixels P present colors to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> may be a gate driving IC, which is bonded to an array substrate (also referred to as a driving backplane) in the display panel <b>100</b>.

Compared with bonding the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> to the array substrate in the form of the gate driving IC, by providing the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> in the array substrate, a manufacturing cost of the display panel may be reduced, and a width of a bezel of the display apparatus may be reduced. The following embodiments are all described by taking an example in which the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> is the GOA circuit.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It will be noted that, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> only show examples in which the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> is disposed on a single side of the peripheral area BB of the display panel <b>100</b>, and the gate lines GL are driven row by row from the single side, i.e., a single-sided driving manner. In some other embodiments, gate driving circuits may be disposed on both sides of the peripheral area BB of the display panel <b>100</b> in an extension direction of the gate lines GL, and the gate lines GL are driven row by row from both sides simultaneously through the two gate driving circuits, i.e., a double-sided driving manner. In yet some other embodiments, the gate driving circuits may be disposed on both sides of the peripheral area BB of the display panel <b>100</b> in the extension direction of the gate lines GL, and the gate lines GL are driven row by row from both sides alternately through the two gate driving circuits. For example, one gate driving circuit drives gate lines GL in odd-numbered rows, and the other gate driving circuit drives gate lines GL in even-numbered rows, i.e., an alternate driving manner. The following embodiments of the present disclosure are all described by taking the single-sided driving manner as an example.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> includes N stages of cascaded shift register circuits (RS<b>1</b>, RS<b>2</b>, . . . , and RS(N)), and the N stages of cascaded shift register circuits (RS<b>1</b>, RS<b>2</b>, . . . , and RS(N)) are respectively connected to N gate lines (G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, . . . , and G(N)) in one-to-one correspondence, and N is a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, circuit structures of the respective stages of shift register circuits (RS<b>1</b>, RS<b>2</b>, . . . , and RS(N)) may be same, and the respective stages of shift register circuits (RS<b>1</b>, RS<b>2</b>, . . . , and RS(N)) are connected in sequence, so that the respective stages of shift register circuits sequentially output turn-on voltages (also referred to as active levels in scan signals, such as high levels), thereby achieving row-by-row scanning of the plurality of gate lines in the display panel, and charging the sub-pixels in respective rows coupled to the gate lines.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a stage of shift register circuit of the gate driving circuit <b>01</b> is denoted as RS(i), and i is equal to 1, 2, . . . , or N.
