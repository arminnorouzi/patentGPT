In addition, a time sensitive communication (TSC) scenario may be further considered. In particular, the mMTC, URLLC, and TSC may be applied in Internet of things (IoT) scenarios. In one network, all or some of the above-described scenarios should be supported. The mMTC scenario may be determined as satisfying the IMT-2020 requirements using narrow band (NB)-IoT and LTE-MTC techniques, but a lot of discussion is needed to satisfy the URLLC scenario.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to reduce an error rate of data, a low modulation and coding scheme (MCS) may be applied. However, in order not to increase a size of a field indicating an MCS in downlink control information (DCI), an MCS table may be configured using frequently used MCSs instead of using all possible MCSs. In order to apply a lower MCS than the MCSs supported by the MCS table, repeated transmission may be supported. In case of applying a QPSK which is the lowest modulation rate, the effect of further reducing the code rate can be achieved. In particular, since a transmission power is limited in case of uplink, repetition in the time domain may be used rather than repetition in the frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In case of eMBB traffic and URLLC traffic supported by the 5G system, a lower MCS may be required for different purposes, respectively. For example, for eMBB traffic, a lower MCS may be required to extend a coverage. On the other hand, for URLLC traffic, a lower MCS may be required to reduce a latency and achieve a lower error rate. Since the requirements are different, in case of eMBB traffic, repeated transmission may be utilized even with a relatively large latency. On the other hand, in case of URLLC traffic, new MCSs may be introduced and applied to DCI/RRC rather than repeated transmission.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In order to support repeated transmission in the time domain for eMBB traffic, PUSCH repetition (or PUSCH repetition type A) has been introduced. In the PUSCH repetition type A, a PUSCH (or PUSCH mapping type A) allocated on a slot basis may be repeatedly transmitted. The PUSCH repetition type A corresponds to a configuration using time resource allocation over several slots in order to enhance the coverage. A DCI (e.g., in case of a type 2 configured grant and a dynamic grant) or RRC signaling (in case of a type 1 configured grant) may indicate only a time resource used for transmission in a first slot, and RRC signaling may indicate the number of repeated transmissions, so that time resources used for the PUSCH repetition type A are determined.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In order to support the URLLC traffic, it is preferable that the terminal performs a reception operation more frequently using downlink (DL) resources and a transmission operation more frequently using uplink (UL) resources. In a time division duplex (TDD) system, since the terminal operates in a half-duplex scheme, a large latency may occur to support DL traffics and UL traffics according to a configured slot pattern (i.e., UL/DL pattern). On the other hand, in a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, since the terminal can use DL resources and UL resources at the same time, the above-described problem of latency may not occur. The FDD system uses two carriers. Even in the case of the TDD system, if two or more serving cells are configured for the terminal, the terminal may use DL resources and UL resources at the same time. For example, in a system including at least one carrier operating in the FDD scheme, the terminal may not have a disadvantage in the latency. For example, in a system configured only with carriers operating in the TDD scheme, a disadvantage in the latency may occur to the terminal. To solve this problem, slots may be configured with different patterns in the carriers operating in the TDD scheme.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Carrier aggregation (CA) may be configured for the terminal, and a PCell and at least one SCell may be activated. The PCell may be distinguished from the SCell in that at least one common search space (CSS) set is included in the PCell. Here, in order to reduce a latency when supporting the URLLC traffics, slots having different patterns may be configured and indicated to the terminal.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Subband Duplex Operations</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">1 Method of Interpreting a Duplex Direction in a Subband</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the TDD system, a slot pattern may be configured to the terminal through RRC signaling. By receiving an additional DCI (e.g., DCI format 2_0), DL reception or UL transmission may be performed in symbol(s) configured as flexible (FL) symbol(s) within a slot by RRC signaling. The operations of the terminal according to the conventional technical specification may be exemplified in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">An index included in the DCI format 2_0 should indicate a DL symbol configured to the terminal through RRC signaling as the DL symbol. Similarly, an index included in the DCI format 2_0 should indicate a UL symbol configured to the terminal through RRC signaling as the UL symbol. However, in a FL symbol configured to the terminal through RRC signaling, reception of a DL signal and/or channel or transmission of a UL signal and/or channel may be allowed according to an index included in the DCI format 2_0. Here, the terminal should consider only a DL signal and/or channel and/or a UL signal and/or channel allocated by a scheduling DCI. Table 1 below relates to transmission and reception interpretation methods when the terminal is configured to receive the DCI format 2_0.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Semi-static DL</entry><entry>Semi-static UL</entry><entry>Semi-static FL</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Dynamic DL</entry><entry>DCI based DL</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>DCI based DL</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>reception</entry><entry/><entry>reception</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Configured DL</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>reception</entry></row><row><entry>Dynamic UL</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>DCI based UL</entry><entry>DCI based UL</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>transmission</entry><entry>transmission</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Configured UL</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>transmission</entry></row><row><entry>Dynamic FL</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>Configured PRS</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">Additionally, if a DCI is not received, the terminal may assume only DL/FL/UL configured through RRC signaling.

In this case, it may be preferable that more FL symbols can be utilized as UL symbols.

Therefore, it may be preferable in terms of transmission efficiency to reduce the number of guard subcarrier(s). For this, it may be preferable that the number of boundaries at which DL and UL are switched is small. If both DL reception and UL transmission are allowed in FL symbol(s), the UL transmission may be preferably performed in subcarriers having a lower frequency so that a reception SINR of a UL signal/channel increases at the base station.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a configuration of resource allocation in which DL transmission and UL reception can be performed in a specific slot.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, FL symbols may be consecutively located, and the FL symbols may be located between DL symbol(s) and UL symbol(s).

An energy (or power or energy per resource element (EPRE)) allocated to the RE(s) to which data is mapped may not change. However, even if zero energy is allocated to the RE(s) to which data is not mapped, an energy transmitted or received by a sidelobe from adjacent REs may not be small, which may act as inter-carrier interference (ICI).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">Therefore, the base station transmitting the PDSCH or the terminal transmitting the PUSCH may perform multi-carrier modulation (IDFT) after performing appropriate filtering in the frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">When the method of indicating the RB set (or guard band) to the terminal is applied, since RRC signaling is used, a time for applying or changing the position of the guard subcarrier(s) may increase.

If an RB set accompanied by RF filtering is indicated, it may be difficult to schedule a PDSCH (or PUSCH) in a period in which DL (or UL) symbol(s) and SD symbol(s) are consecutive, and a minimum interval between the DL (or UL) symbol(s) and the SD symbol(s) may have to be guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram for describing an example in which characteristics of subcarriers are expressed using RMRs.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an RMR may occur periodically, and whether the RMR is applied or ignored may be determined by a scheduling DCI.

A certain field of the scheduling DCI may correspond to the RMR group, and one bit of the certain field may determine whether to perform data mapping in consideration of RMR(s) belonging to the RMR group. The RMR may be given to the terminal through RRC signaling as a resource composed of RB(s) and symbol(s), a time resource in which the RMR occurs may be indicated to the terminal by RRC signaling as being expressed by one index, and a periodicity and a slot offset thereof may be derived from the index.

In the RB set (or guard band), a PDSCH and PUSCH may not be mapped, and an RMR for the PDSCH and/or an RMR for the PUSCH should be able to be derived from one signaling.

In addition, even in the case of a configured grant PUSCH, a TB size may be determined by reflecting a rate matching resource (or invalid resource).</p><p id="p-0252" num="0250">Method 3-10: When the terminal performs repeated PUSCH transmissions, a TB size may be determined by reflecting a rate matching resource.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0251">3.3 Method Determining a Transmission Power</p><p id="p-0254" num="0252">The terminal may determine a transmission power applied to the PUSCH based on the amount of scheduled resources. According to the conventional technical specifications, the transmission power of the PUSCH may be maintained to be identical in all REs of the PUSCH, and may be determined regardless of whether frequency hopping is applied.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0253">Therefore, when a bandwidth is changed by applying rate matching, a method for determining a power applied to one frequency hop of the PUSCH (instance) is required. It may be advantageous for phase continuity that the transmission power is maintained as it is. When the transmission power is changed, a noise may be generated in some OFDM samples for a time required for the change of the transmission power.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0254">Method 3-11: A transmission power of a PUSCH may be determined regardless of PUSCH rate matching.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0255">When a bandwidth of the PUSCH is changed, the transmission power may be changed according to the conventional technical specification. For example, when the number of RBs of the scheduled PUSCH is M, 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>M may be reflected in the transmission power. Accordingly, when rate matching is performed and the number of RBs is changed to M<sub>1</sub>(&#x3c;M), 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>M<sub>1 </sub>may be reflected in an equation for determining the transmission power.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0256">According to Method 3-11, even if the number of RBs is changed, 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>M may be reflected when determining the transmission power. Although the first hop and the second hop of the PUSCH may have different bandwidths, their transmission powers may be kept the same. In this case, an EPRE of the first hop and an EPRE of the second hop may be different from each other. Therefore, for each hop of the PUSCH, a received SINR obtained by the base station may be different. In addition, since each hop of the PUSCH may have a bandwidth, the length of the sequence applied to the DM-RS should be different. Therefore, it may be preferable that the DM-RS have different parameters in the first hop and the second hop.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0257">As another configuration parameter for determining the transmission power, the number of REs may be used. According to the conventional technical specifications, it may be possible to configure the transmission power to increase when the number of REs increases. For example, deltaMCS may be enabled. In this case, the number of REs may depend on a result of rate matching. For example, a scheduled PUSCH may include at least a TB, and when the number of REs is N, 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>1.25&#xd7;TBS/N</sup>) may be reflected in the transmission power. Here, a TB size (TBS) may be the number of REs belonging to the TB. Therefore, when rate matching is performed, if the number of REs is changed to N<sub>1</sub>(&#x3c;N), 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>1.25&#xd7;TBS/N</sup><sup><sub2>1</sub2></sup>) may be reflected in the equation for determining the transmission power.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0258">According to the proposed Method 3-11, even if the number of REs is changed, 10&#xb7;log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>1.25&#xd7;TBS/N</sup>) may be reflected when determining the transmission power.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0259">3.4 Method Reporting a Transmission Power Headroom</p><p id="p-0262" num="0260">The result of rate matching may affect not only when determining the transmission power of the PUSCH but also when generating a power headroom report. However, according to Method 3-11, the result of rate matching may not affect the generation of the power headroom report.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0261">When generating a Type1 power headroom report, the terminal may generate the Type1 power headroom report for actual transmission or a reference format.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">According to the conventional technical specification, the terminal may report a power headroom to the base station by using a PHR MAC CE. The PHR MAC CE may be a single entry PHR MAC CE or a multiple entry PHR MAC CE according to a MAC subheader. When the multiple entry PHR MAC CE is used, whether a power headroom report is generated for actual transmission or a reference format may be reported to the base station by using one bit.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">Method 3-12: When the power headroom for actual transmission is derived, the power headroom in which rate matching is reflected may be derived.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">3.5 UCI Rate Matching Method</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">The terminal may not transmit a PUCCH and a PUSCH at the same time, but may transmit only the PUSCH, but may multiplex a UCI to be included in the PUCCH to the PUSCH. When frequency hopping is applied to the PUSCH, the terminal may perform UCI rate matching and map coded data (i.e., coded TB) to the remaining REs.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0266">A PUSCH to which frequency hopping is applied may be considered. According to the conventional technical specification, hops of the PUSCH may have the same number of REs. Accordingly, rate matching may be performed by considering the number of REs to which the encoded UCI is mapped as a half.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0267">However, when PUSCH rate matching is performed and the first hop and the second hop of the PUSCH have different numbers of REs, the encoded UCI may not be divided in half. For example, when the first hop and the second hop of the PUSCH have K<sub>1 </sub>REs and K<sub>2 </sub>REs, respectively, their relative ratios K<sub>1</sub>/(K<sub>1</sub>+K<sub>2</sub>) (hereinafter, &#x3ba;<sub>1</sub>) and K<sub>2</sub>/(K<sub>i</sub>+K<sub>2</sub>) (hereinafter, &#x3ba;<sub>2</sub>) may be calculated. Therefore, when determining the amount of the encoded UCI mapped to the first hop of the PUSCH and the amount of the encoded UCI mapped to the second hop of the PUSCH, the ratio may be reflected.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0268">Method 3-13: The amounts G(1) and G(2) in which UCI expressed in G bits are mapped to the PUSCH hops may be determined by K<sub>1 </sub>and K<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0269">For example, in the case of a PUSCH with a UL-SCH, G(1)=N<sub>L</sub>&#xb7;Q<sub>m</sub>&#xb7;&#x2514;G/(N<sub>L</sub>&#xb7;Q<sub>m</sub>)&#xb7;&#x3ba;<sub>1</sub>&#x2518; may be defined, and G(1)+G(2)=G may be established.

For a repetition factor K indicated to the terminal, since the terminal transmits the PUSCH only in some of K consecutive slots, the number of repetitions actually transmitted may be less than K. Alternatively, the terminal may select slots in which the PUSCH is transmitted so that the number of transmitted repetitions becomes K.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0272">Here, a slot in which the PUSCH repetition is not transmitted may mean a slot in which a DL symbol belonging to a slot format indicated to the terminal through RRC signaling (i.e., tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and/or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated) and a scheduled PUSCH overlap and/or a slot in which a SS/PBCH block indicated to the terminal through RRC signaling (i.e., ssb-PositionsInBurst) and a scheduled PUSCH overlap.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0273">According to the conventional technical specification, it is stipulated that valid slots are determined excluding symbols configured to receive a DL signal/channel according to a slot format.

In this case, a cross link interference may occur in the same frequency resource when DL and UL are misaligned between adjacent base stations. In addition, when the terminal performs UL transmission, the UL transmission may act as interference to DL reception of other UEs.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0280">In this case, the terminal may derive the transmission power applied to the same symbol differently from the existing method in order to reduce interference with other terminals. In addition, the base station may allocate the transmission power applied to the same symbol differently from the conventional method.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0281">Method 4-1: When deriving a DL EPRE, a separate power offset may be applied to a symbol (SD symbol) to which subband duplex is applied.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0282">For example, when a transmission power of a SS/PBCH block is configured through RRC signaling, one or more values may be configured to the terminal.

A measurement target symbol may be reported when a measurement result is reported to the base station. The measured value by the measurement may be a received signal reference power (RSRP) and/or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).</p><p id="p-0288" num="0286">The measurement resource may be composed of a specific symbol and specific subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0287">Method 4-3: A set of measurement resources is separately configured to the terminal by RRC signaling, and measurement and reporting may be independently performed for each measurement resource.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0288">For example, a measurement resource <b>1</b> and a measurement resource <b>2</b> may be configured for the terminal.

Even when the same DL-RSs (SS/PBCH blocks and/or CSI-RSs) are used, if they belong to different measurement resources, the terminal may not utilize them for L1 filtering or L3 filtering. The reason is that since the transmission power (or EPRE) of the base station may vary for each measurement resource, a received power may also vary for each measurement resource.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0289">The terminal may report a measurement result for the measurement resource <b>1</b> and/or a measurement result for the measurement resource <b>2</b> to the base station.

The terminal may derive resources in which the SRS is transmitted after a predetermined time elapses from a time when transmission of the aperiodic SRS is triggered based on an equation defined in the technical specification. Since the time at which the SRS is transmitted is not explicitly indicated to the terminal, the terminal may select the first transmittable resource from among the resources derived from the equation.

Since the terminal has established an RRC connection, it may be indicated not only with a common slot pattern but also with a dedicated slot pattern (e.g., tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated), and may receive a dynamic SFI. Also, the terminal may receive information indicating DL or UL for each subband from the base station.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0309">For example, when the terminal receives a DCI format 1_0, if the received DCI format 1_0 satisfies a specific condition (e.g., when all FDRA fields are configured as 1), the terminal may interpret the DCI as a PDCCH order rather than a scheduling DCI. In this case, the terminal may interpret received information fields of the DCI format for a purpose of the PDCCH order.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0310">The PDCCH order may indicate a random access preamble index, an SS/PBCH block index, and a PRACH mask index, and the terminal may derive one resource by using these.

In this case, repetition that has not been transmitted may also be counted as transmitted.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0342">When the terminal is configured to select an available slot, the terminal may identify whether a certain slot has a slot format in which a PUSCH can be transmitted and additionally identify whether transmission is possible for each subband. When a PUSCH can be transmitted in the slot format indicated by RRC signaling and/or SFI, the terminal may transmit the PUSCH. In addition, even when PUSCH transmission is not allowed according to the slot format, if the PUSCH can be transmitted according to a duplex pattern according to a subband indicated by RRC signaling and/or enhanced SFI, the terminal may transmit the PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0343">8 Method of Generating a HARQ-ACK Codebook</p><p id="p-0346" num="0344">When the terminal is indicated to feedback HARQ-ACKs in the same (sub)slot, or when PUCCHs indicated to the terminal overlap each other in time, the terminal may arrange HARQ-ACK bits in a predetermined order to generate one HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0345">The HARQ codebook may be classified into several types, and one type may be indicated to the terminal by RRC signaling. In the case of a Type1 HARQ codebook, Type3 HARQ codebook, and enhanced Type3 HARQ codebook, the size of the HARQ codebook may depend on RRC signaling. Therefore, even when a case where the terminal misses a scheduling DCI occurs, the size of the HARQ codebook may not be changed. However, the terminal may have to maintain the size of the HARQ codebook by generating unnecessary HARQ-ACK(s).</p><p id="p-0348" num="0346">Meanwhile, since the Type2 HARQ codebook includes only HARQ-ACK(s) for PDSCH(s) allocated by scheduling DCI(s), the size of the HARQ codebook may vary. To prevent this, an additional information field may be added to the scheduling DCI, which can be used for a purpose of estimating the number of scheduling DCIs.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0347">When the terminal can receive a PDSCH even in SD symbol(s), at least the size of the Type1 HARQ codebook may be affected. The size of the Type1 HARQ codebook may be determined regardless of whether a scheduling DCI is received, but may be affected by reception of a group common DCI (i.e., dynamic SFI). According to a proposed method, whether the terminal can receive a PDSCH in SD symbol(s) may also affect the size of the Type1 HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0348">When information indicating SD symbol(s) is included in a group common DCI, the terminal may determine the size of the Type1 HARQ codebook by using the information.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0349">In an active DL BWP, a TDRA index and a K1 index may be indicated to the terminal. In a K1 set indicated to the terminal by RRC signaling, one value may be indicated to the terminal as the K1 index. In a TDRA table indicated to the terminal by RRC signaling, any one value may be indicated to the terminal as the TDRA index.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0350">Here, several K1 sets may be indicated to the terminal by RRC signaling, and the terminal may derive one K1 set as an intersection, union, or difference of the K1 sets. For example, when the terminal can receive a multicast PDSCH, a K1 set for multicast PDSCHs and the existing K1 set for unicast PDSCHs may be separately configured for the terminal. In this case, depending on a mode in which the terminal operates, one K1 set may be derived as an union, difference, or intersection thereof.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0351">According to the conventional technical specification, the terminal may not include a HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH candidate expected to have been received before switching of an active DL BWP or switching of an active UL BWP of a serving cell to which a PUCCH is to be transmitted in the HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0352">When a part of SD symbol(s) is interpreted as DL/FL/UL, a case in which a bandwidth of a DL subband and/or a UL subband is changed according to an indication of the base station may be additionally considered. When this is interpreted as a BWP switching, according to the conventional technical specification, a HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH candidate may not be included in the HARQ codebook. In a proposed method, the validity of the PDSCH candidate may not be interpreted according to BWP switching. That is, even if the bandwidth interpretation of the SD symbol is changed, a HARQ-ACK for a previously received PDSCH candidate may be included in the HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0353">Method 8-1: When a part of SD symbol(s) is interpreted as DL/FL/UL and a bandwidth of a DL/FL/UL subband is changed, a HARQ-ACK for a previously generated PDSCH candidate may be included in the HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0354">The terminal may determine a method of determining a case where a PDSCH (or one of PDSCH repetition(s)) derived based on a TDRA is valid in consideration of SD symbol(s).</p><p id="p-0357" num="0355">According to the conventional technical specification, when repeated PDSCH transmission is indicated to the terminal, the terminal may expect to receive PDSCH repetitions in consecutive slots. However, if symbols configured as UL by RRC signaling (i.e., tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon and/or tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated) exist among symbols belonging to the PDSCH repetition(s), the terminal may not include HARQ-ACKs for PDSCH repetitions derived from the corresponding TDRA in the HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0356">If a scenario in which a part of SD symbol(s) can be interpreted as DL/FL/UL is considered, it may not be preferable to determine the validity of PDSCH repetition in units of symbol(s) as in the conventional technical specification. In a proposed method, the validity of PDSCH repetition may be determined in units of RE.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0357">Method 8-2: When a part of SD symbol(s) can be interpreted as DL/FL/UL and DL reception is allowed in all REs belonging to the PDSCH (repetitions), HARQ-ACKs for PDSCHs (repetitions) derived from the corresponding TDRA may be included in the HARQ codebook.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0358">The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented as program instructions executable by a variety of computers and recorded on a computer readable medium.
