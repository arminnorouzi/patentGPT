Thus, the computer needs to process the document content. In the existing technology, the computer has a set of halftone characteristic parameters and performs same processing on all printers. However, since the printers have different physical characteristics, image quality and color accuracy may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, after the GDI printer is connected to the computer, the GDI printer sends halftone characteristic parameters of the GDI printer to the computer. The computer processes content that is to be printed according to the halftone characteristic parameters sent by the GDI printer to ensure the quality and color accuracy of the printed content.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Print control may be performed using the above solution. If a user has sent a printing job through the computer when the computer is not connected to the GDI printer, the computer needs to wait after the computer is connected to the GDI printer to process the content that is to be processed according to the halftone characteristic parameters sent by the GDI printer. As such, printing time of a first page may be increased, and user experience is not high.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an image forming control method applied to an image forming apparatus. The method includes, after the image forming apparatus is connected to an image processing apparatus, sending information related to a halftone parameter of the image forming apparatus to the image processing apparatus for storage, obtaining halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed sent by the image processing apparatus, and outputting the halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed to an image generator to perform an image forming operation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an image forming control method applied to an image processing apparatus. The method includes, before the image processing apparatus is connected to a target image forming apparatus, obtaining information related to a historical halftone parameter, and performing halftone processing on intermediate data that is to be printed according to the information related to the historical halftone parameter. The information related to the historical halftone parameter includes information related to a halftone parameter sent after the image processing apparatus is connected to the target image forming apparatus a previous time. The method further includes, after the image processing apparatus is connected to the target image forming apparatus, obtaining and saving information related to the halftone parameter sent by the target image forming apparatus this time and sending halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed to the target image forming apparatus to perform an image forming operation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide an image forming control device based on an image forming apparatus, including a processor and a memory. The memory stores an instruction that, when executed by the processor, causes the processor to, after the image forming apparatus is connected to an image processing apparatus, send information related to a halftone parameter of the image forming apparatus to the image processing apparatus for storage, obtain halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed sent by the image processing apparatus, and output the halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed to an image generator to perform an image forming operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Through the above technical solution, the image processing apparatus can save the information related to the halftone parameter sent by the image forming apparatus. When the image processing apparatus is not connected to the image forming apparatus and the user has sent a printing job through the image processing apparatus, the image processing apparatus may perform the halftone processing on the intermediate data that is to be printed according to the saved information related to the historical halftone parameter. After being connected to the image forming apparatus, the image processing apparatus may send the halftone-processed intermediate data that is to be printed to the target image forming apparatus to perform the image forming operation. After the image processing apparatus is connected to the image forming apparatus, the image processing apparatus may also obtain and save the information related to the halftone parameter sent by the target image forming apparatus this time. The image processing apparatus may also use the information related to the halftone parameter sent by the target image forming apparatus this time as the information related to the historical halftone parameter for use the next time when the image processing apparatus is not connected to the image forming apparatus and the user has sent a printing job through the image processing apparatus. Thus, the output time of the first page of the image forming apparatus may not be increased while the printing quality is ensured.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an image forming control scene according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of an image forming control method according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of saving information related to a halftone parameter during a first connection according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of an image forming control method according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of image forming control according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram showing an image forming control device based on an image forming apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram showing an image forming control device based on an image processing apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an image forming control apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic connection diagram showing an image forming control system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an image forming control apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to make the purposes, technical solutions, and advantages of embodiments of the present disclosure clearer, the technical solutions of embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below in connection with the accompanying drawings of embodiments of the present disclosure.
