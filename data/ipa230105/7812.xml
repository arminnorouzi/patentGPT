Moreover, the spring <b>84</b> can pull the slider <b>82</b> to the storage location. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the storage location, the flexible tube <b>70</b> is bent in the plane, and limits the bending of the two curved sections S<b>131</b> of the tube S<b>13</b> to the same plane.

Moreover, the present disclosure can replace a fan device in an existing chassis with a removable device, so the design cost of the cooling system can be reduced, and components such as pump and tank do not occupy the space of the main board in the chassis. Furthermore, the present disclosure uses the sliding mechanism and the flexible tube to prevent damage caused by tube entanglement or improper bending when the removable device is installed or removed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Many details are often found in the relevant art, thus many such details are neither shown nor described.
