The brake system <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as a hydraulic brake by wire system in which electronically controlled fluid pressure is utilized to apply braking forces for the brake system <b>100</b>. The brake system <b>100</b> may suitably be used on a ground vehicle, such as an automotive vehicle having four wheels with a wheel brake associated with each wheel. Furthermore, the brake system <b>100</b> can be provided with other braking functions such as anti-lock braking (ABS) and other slip control features to effectively brake the vehicle. Components of the brake system <b>100</b> may be housed in one or more blocks or housings. The block or housing may be made from solid material, such as aluminum, that has been drilled, machined, or otherwise formed to house the various components. Fluid conduits may also be formed in the block or housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the illustrated embodiment of the brake system <b>100</b>, there are four wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D. The wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D can have any suitable wheel brake structure operated electrically and/or by the application of pressurized brake fluid. Each of the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D may include, for example, a brake caliper mounted on the vehicle to engage a frictional element (such as a brake disc) that rotates with a vehicle wheel to effect braking of the associated vehicle wheel. The wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D can be associated with any combination of front and rear wheels of the vehicle in which the brake system <b>100</b> is installed. For example, the brake system <b>100</b> may be configured as a front/rear split system, as shown, such that a first pressure circuit (indicated by dashed line &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is associated with providing fluid to one or both of the rear wheel brakes <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B A second pressure circuit (indicated by dashed line &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be associated with providing fluid to one or both of the front wheel brakes <b>102</b>C and <b>102</b>D It is contemplated that any of the wheel brakes <b>102</b> referenced herein as being hydraulically operated may also or instead be electrically operated, such as by including at least one rear wheel brake motor (not shown) for selectively electrically actuating parking and/or service brakes, for some use environments of the brake system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this example, the wheel brake <b>102</b>A may be associated with a left rear wheel of the vehicle in which the brake system <b>100</b> is installed, and the wheel brake <b>102</b>B may be associated with the right rear wheel. The wheel brake <b>102</b>C may be associated with the left front wheel, and the wheel brake <b>102</b>D may be associated with the right front wheel. Alternatively, though not depicted here, the brake system <b>100</b> may be configured as a diagonal split brake system such that the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B are associated with wheels at two diagonal corners of the vehicle, and the wheel brakes <b>102</b>C and <b>102</b>D are associated with wheels on the other two diagonal corners of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The brake system <b>100</b> generally includes a brake pedal unit, indicated generally at <b>104</b>, a pedal simulator, indicated generally at <b>106</b>, a power transmission unit (also known as a dual acting plunger (&#x201c;DAP&#x201d;) or a plunger assembly in some configurations), indicated generally at <b>108</b>, and a fluid reservoir <b>110</b>. The reservoir <b>110</b> stores and holds hydraulic fluid for the brake system <b>100</b>. The fluid within the reservoir <b>110</b> is preferably held at or about atmospheric pressure, but the fluid may be stored at other pressures if desired. The reservoir <b>110</b> is shown schematically having three tanks or sections with fluid conduit lines connected thereto. The sections can be separated by several interior walls within the reservoir <b>110</b> and are provided to prevent complete drainage of the reservoir <b>110</b> in case one of the sections is depleted due to a leakage via one or more of the three lines connected to the reservoir <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the reservoir <b>110</b> may include multiple separate housings. The reservoir <b>110</b> may include at least one fluid level sensor <b>112</b> (two shown, for redundancy) for detecting the fluid level of one or more of the sections of the reservoir <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The power transmission unit <b>108</b> of the brake system <b>100</b> functions as a source of pressure to provide a desired pressure level to the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D during a typical or normal non-failure brake apply. After a brake apply, fluid from the hydraulically operated ones of the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D may be returned to the power transmission unit <b>108</b> and/or diverted to the reservoir <b>110</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the power transmission unit <b>108</b> is a dual acting plunger assembly which is configured to also provide boosted pressure to the brake system <b>100</b> when a piston of the power transmission unit <b>108</b> is stroked rearwardly as well as forwardly. It is also contemplated that a configuration (not shown) of the brake system <b>100</b> could include hydraulic control of only two wheels, with the remaining wheels being electrically controlled/actuated. One of ordinary skill in the art would be readily able to provide such an arrangement for a desired use environment, following aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Regardless of specific configuration, though, the power transmission unit <b>108</b> is configured for selectively providing pressurized hydraulic fluid for actuating at least a selected one of the wheel brakes <b>102</b> in a boosted braking mode during a braking event.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The brake system <b>100</b> also includes at least one electronic control unit (&#x201c;ECU&#x201d;) <b>114</b>. As shown and described herein, two separate ECUs <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B are provided, for redundancy. Each ECU <b>114</b> may include microprocessors and other electrical circuitry. Each ECU <b>114</b> receives various signals, processes signals, and controls the operation of various electrical components of the brake system <b>100</b> in response to the received signals. Each ECU <b>114</b> can be connected to various sensors such as the reservoir fluid level sensor <b>112</b>, pressure sensors, travel sensors, switches, wheel speed sensors, and steering angle sensors. Each ECU <b>114</b> may also be connected to an external module (not shown) for receiving information related to yaw rate, lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle, or other characteristics of vehicle operation for any reason, such as, but not limited to, controlling the brake system <b>100</b> during vehicle braking, stability operation, or other modes of operation. Additionally, each ECU <b>114</b> may be connected to the instrument cluster for collecting and supplying information related to warning indicators such as an ABS warning light, a brake fluid level warning light, and a traction control/vehicle stability control indicator light. The electronic control units <b>114</b>A, <b>114</b>B are provided, in the configuration of the brake system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for controlling at least one of the power transmission unit <b>108</b> and the first and second pressure circuits.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the brake pedal unit <b>104</b> includes a master cylinder <b>116</b> with a housing <b>118</b> for slidably receiving various cylindrical pistons and other components therein. Note that the housing is not specifically schematically shown in the Figures, but instead the walls of the longitudinally extending bore are schematically illustrated. The housing <b>118</b> may be formed as a single unit or include two or more separately formed portions coupled together. An input piston <b>120</b> is connected with a brake pedal <b>122</b> via a linkage arm <b>124</b>. Leftward movement of the input piston <b>120</b> may cause, under certain conditions, a pressure increase within the master cylinder <b>116</b>. In the brake system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the master cylinder <b>116</b> can be used to provide a manual push through mode, during predetermined phases of operation of the brake system <b>100</b>, on a routine and/or acute event basis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The brake pedal unit <b>104</b> is connected to the brake pedal <b>122</b> and is actuated by the driver of the vehicle as the driver presses on the brake pedal <b>122</b>. A brake sensor or switch <b>144</b> may be electrically connected to the ECU <b>114</b> to provide a signal indicating a depression of the brake pedal <b>122</b>. The pedal simulator <b>106</b>, when present, provides a comfortable and expected &#x201c;feel&#x201d; to the brake pedal <b>122</b> motion for the driver and is hydraulically connected to the master cylinder <b>116</b> via pedal simulator valve <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The brake pedal unit <b>104</b> may be used as a back-up source of pressurized fluid to essentially replace the normally supplied source of pressurized fluid from the power transmission unit <b>108</b> under certain failed conditions of the brake system <b>100</b>, and/or upon initial startup of the brake system <b>100</b>.

In the brake system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, manual push-through may be accomplished for one pair of wheel brakes <b>102</b> only (usually for the pair of front wheel brakes <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D for vehicle weight distribution and weight transfer during braking reasons), or for all four wheel brakes <b>102</b> (i.e., the pair of front wheel brakes <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D and the pair of rear wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The brake pedal unit <b>104</b> can supply pressurized fluid to a master cylinder output <b>128</b>, which is then routed to the hydraulically operated ones of the wheel brakes <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, and <b>102</b>D as desired.
