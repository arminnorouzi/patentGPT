A core component of such a device is a wavelength selective switch (WSS). Similar to that of an optical filter, a filtering effect is generated after an optical signal passes through the WSS. Because a bandwidth of an optical filter has a limited slope, available passbands of the optical filter are all smaller than an ideal passband. Therefore, the WSS currently causes a problem of narrowing an actual bandwidth of a channel. As a quantity of cascaded components increases, cascaded optical filtering reduces an actual bandwidth of a channel progressively. As a result, spectral damage is caused to the transmission channel, resulting in increased transmission costs and a shortened transmission distance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional technology, an equalization method based on digital signal processing (DSP) may be used to alleviate a bandwidth narrowing problem caused by a WSS. For example, a pre-equalization algorithm is used at a transmit end to pre-emphasize a spectral shape of a transmit signal. Alternatively, a post-equalization algorithm is used at a receive end to perform equalization processing on a received signal. However, the DSP-based algorithm needs to consume specific quantities of chip resources and power. Especially, more power and resources need to be consumed for high-order modulation formats. In addition, in case of dynamic routing, implementation complexity is relatively high for obtaining an actual signal state required for equalization processing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, this application provides a spectrum resource configuration method, a network device, and a system, to resolve the following problem: when a channel bandwidth is increased, relatively large quantities of chip resources and power are consumed, and implementation complexity is relatively high.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, this application provides a spectrum resource configuration method. The method includes: A network device determines spectrum resources to be used by a to-be-opened channel, where the spectrum resources to be used by the to-be-opened channel include first spectrum resources and a second spectrum resource, the first spectrum resources are original spectrum resources of the to-be-opened channel, the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of an adjacent channel of the to-be-opened channel, and the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel are adjacent to the original spectrum resources of the to-be-opened channel; and the network device opens the to-be-opened channel based on the spectrum resources to be used by the to-be-opened channel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This embodiment of the present invention may be executed by a network management system, a node, or a module in a node. The to-be-opened channel may borrow some of the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel, to reduce channel damage caused by filtering costs and improve service transmission performance. An original spectrum resource may be a spectrum resource planned for a channel before the channel is opened. The spectrum resources to be used by the to-be-opened channel are actual spectrum resources used when the to-be-opened channel is opened. The technical solution of the present invention does not need to consume relatively large quantities of hardware resources and power. In addition, routing information of a service does not need to be obtained, to be specific, whether a signal is in a wave-adding, wave-dropping, or pass-through direction does not need to be known, and software control complexity is low.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a possible implementation, the first spectrum resources and the second spectrum resource are located in a continuous spectrum range. The first spectrum resources and the second spectrum resource are continuous spectra. This can effectively extend a bandwidth of the to-be-opened channel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible implementation, a quantity of the second spectrum resources is less than or equal to a half of a quantity of the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel. For example, the second spectrum resource may be a spectrum slice of the adjacent channel, and accounts for a half of a quantity of original spectrum slices of the adjacent channel at most. With a spectrum resource use rule properly set, the routing information of the service does not need to be obtained. This can avoid a problem that recurrent noise occurs due to a signal loop generated on the adjacent channel when a spectrum resource of the adjacent channel is used by another channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a possible implementation, the determining spectrum resources to be used by a to-be-opened channel includes: determining, based on a spectrum resource use status of the adjacent channel, the spectrum resources to be used by the to-be-opened channel, where the spectrum resource use status of the adjacent channel includes whether the adjacent channel occupies the spectrum resource to be used by the to-be-opened channel. When the spectrum resources of the adjacent channel are not occupied, that is, the adjacent channel is not opened, or the adjacent channel is opened but has a lower priority, the to-be-opened channel may borrow some of the spectrum resources of the adjacent channel, to extend the bandwidth of the to-be-opened channel.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation, when the adjacent channel occupies some of the first spectrum resources, the method further includes: the network device releases the spectrum resource, in the first spectrum resources, occupied by the adjacent channel. When the adjacent channel is opened and occupies the spectrum resource of the to-be-opened channel, the spectrum resource, of the to-be-opened channel, occupied by the adjacent channel may be released, so that the to-be-opened channel is successfully opened.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a possible implementation, the adjacent channel includes two channels, and the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of either or both of the adjacent channels. If there is only one adjacent channel, the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel. The second spectrum resource may be flexibly set for the to-be-opened channel, to increase the bandwidth, reduce channel damage caused by filtering costs, and improve service transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible implementation, that a network device determines spectrum resources to be used by a to-be-opened channel includes: the network device receives configuration information, where the configuration information includes the spectrum resources to be used by the to-be-opened channel. In this embodiment of the present invention, the network management system may be used to allocate all spectrum resources to be used by to-be-opened channels, and then configure spectrum resource information for the network device (a node). Centralized and flexible spectrum resource allocation by the network management system facilitates overall optimization of network resources.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a possible implementation, a same level may be set for attenuation values of the first spectrum resources and the second spectrum resource. This helps reduce intersymbol interference of the to-be-opened channel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect, this application provides a spectrum resource configuration method. The method includes: A network device determines a to-be-closed channel, where spectrum resources used by the to-be-closed channel include first spectrum resources and a second spectrum resource, the first spectrum resources are original spectrum resources of the to-be-closed channel, the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of an adjacent channel of the to-be-closed channel, and the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel are adjacent to the original spectrum resources of the to-be-closed channel; and the network device closes the to-be-closed channel based on the spectrum resources used by the to-be-closed channel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This embodiment of the present invention may be executed by a network management system, a node, or a module in a node.

After the to-be-closed channel is closed, the adjacent channel may use the spectrum resource released by the to-be-closed channel, to increase a bandwidth of the adjacent channel, reduce channel damage caused by filtering costs, and improve service transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a possible implementation, the adjacent channel includes two channels, and the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of either or both of the adjacent channels. If there is only one adjacent channel, the second spectrum resource is some of original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel. The second spectrum resource may be flexibly set for a to-be-opened channel, to increase a bandwidth, reduce channel damage caused by filtering costs, and improve service transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a possible implementation, a same level may be set for attenuation values of the first spectrum resources and the second spectrum resource.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a, </i>a network architecture bow is a ring network including five nodes N<b>1</b> to N<b>5</b>. Signal transmission in the ring network may be unidirectional or bidirectional. In this embodiment of the present invention, unidirectional transmission in a counterclockwise direction is used as an example for description (a signal transmission direction is indicated by an arrow in the figure). When no channel is opened, a channel start mode of a WSS in each node is a blocking mode (that is, a channel is in a closed state), to prevent recurrent noise from an optical amplifier (not shown in the figure). For example, if a channel ch<b>2</b> is opened on the node N<b>1</b>, a signal in the channel ch<b>2</b> is transmitted from the node N<b>1</b> to the node N<b>2</b>. Therefore, the channel ch<b>2</b> is separately opened by using a WSS in each of the node N<b>1</b> and the node N<b>2</b>, that is, spectrum (or wavelength or bandwidth) resources are configured for the channel ch<b>2</b>. Generally, each channel (also referred to as a passage, a frequency channel, or a wave channel) has one center wavelength, that is, carries one wavelength signal. Spectrum resources of a channel use a central wavelength as a center, and a spectrum width is a bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram of another network architecture according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a difference between a network architecture <b>100</b><i>b </i>and the network architecture <b>100</b><i>a </i>lies in that all of the nodes N<b>1</b> to N<b>5</b> may be controlled by using a network management system (or a controller). The network management system may be implemented by using an independent server to monitor, manage, and control each node. For example, when the channel ch<b>2</b> is opened on the node N<b>1</b> and the node N<b>2</b>, the network management system analyzes which spectrum resources need to be configured for the channel ch<b>2</b>, and delivers a command. The node N<b>1</b> and the node N<b>2</b> can open the channel according to the command of the network management system, that is, configure spectrum resources.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic diagram of a spectrum resource plan according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, spectrum resources in a band range may be divided into a plurality of spectrum slices according to a spectrum granularity. The spectrum granularity is a spectrum width of each slice. For example, the spectrum granularity may be 3.125 GHz, 6.25 GHz, or the like. Spectrum planning is performed on three channels ch<b>1</b>, ch<b>2</b>, and ch<b>3</b> by using a spectrum slice as a unit. Spectrum resources of each channel may include one or more spectrum slices. Original spectrum resources of the channels ch<b>1</b>, ch<b>2</b>, and ch<b>3</b> are located in a continuous spectrum range. The original spectrum resources of the channels ch<b>1</b> and ch<b>2</b> are adjacent, and the original spectrum resources of the channels ch<b>2</b> and ch<b>3</b> are adjacent. In an example, a segment of spectrum resources whose bandwidth is 50 GHz is divided into 12 spectrum slices according to a spectrum granularity of 3.125 GHz. The original spectrum resources of the channel ch<b>2</b> are slices 5 to 8, the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel ch<b>1</b> are slices 1 to 4, and the original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel ch<b>3</b> are slices 9 to 12. Bandwidths of the three channels each are 12.5 GHz. The three channels may alternatively have different bandwidths. This is not limited in the present invention. An original spectrum resource may be a spectrum resource planned for a channel before the channel is opened. In this embodiment of the present invention, some of original spectrum slices of an adjacent channel may be borrowed and configured for the current to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b>, to provide flexible channel spectrum configuration. This can minimize a bandwidth loss caused by filtering, and reduce transmission costs caused by filtering.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Opening the channel ch<b>2</b> is used as an example to provide an example description on an opening mode of the channel ch<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Conventional mode A: The original spectrum resources of the channel ch<b>2</b> are slices 5 to 8, and actual spectrum resources used when the channel ch<b>2</b> is opened are slices 5 to 8.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Optimization mode B: The original spectrum resources of the channel ch<b>2</b> are slices 5 to 8, and actual spectrum resources used when the channel ch<b>2</b> is opened are slices 4 to 9.

In the optimization modes, a channel can borrow some of original spectrum slices of an adjacent channel in addition to using its own original spectrum. An optimization mode is not limited to the foregoing three types, provided that a quantity of borrowed spectrum slices is less than or equal to a half of a quantity of original spectrum slices of an adjacent channel used for the borrowing. The channel ch<b>2</b> may additionally use a maximum of two spectrum slices of the adjacent channel ch<b>1</b> or ch<b>3</b>.

It can be learned that, compared with the conventional mode A, in each of the optimization modes B, C, and D, some spectrum resources of an adjacent channel are borrowed. This can effectively increase a bandwidth of an opened channel, thereby reducing channel damage caused by filtering costs, and improving service transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a node according to the present invention.

The demultiplexing module <b>301</b> may be implemented by using a coupler, and the multiplexing module <b>302</b> may be implemented by using a WSS. The wave-adding module <b>303</b> may be implemented by using a multiplexer <b>3031</b> and a transmitter <b>3032</b>, and the wave-dropping module <b>304</b> may be implemented by using a demultiplexer <b>3041</b> and a receiver <b>3042</b>. In an example of a signal transmission direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the demultiplexing module <b>301</b> receives input signals &#x3bb;1 to &#x3bb;80 from a line side. Some wavelength signals &#x3bb;41 to &#x3bb;80 of the input signals directly pass through, and are input to the multiplexing module <b>302</b> through a demultiplexing port. Local wave-dropping is performed on some wavelength signals &#x3bb;1 to &#x3bb;40 of the input signals by using the wave-dropping module <b>304</b>. The wave-adding module <b>303</b> may perform wave-adding on local wavelength signals &#x3bb;81 to &#x3bb;120. The multiplexing module <b>302</b> performs multiplexing on the local wavelength signals &#x3bb;81 to &#x3bb;120 obtained after the wave-adding and the pass-through wavelength signals &#x3bb;41 to &#x3bb;80, and outputs signals obtained after the multiplexing to the line side.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a WSS according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the WSS (M&#xd7;N dimensions) may include M demultiplexing ports and N multiplexing ports. For example, M is 4, and N is 1. The demultiplexing ports of the WSS may include ports <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>, <b>403</b>, and <b>404</b>, and the multiplexing port may include port <b>405</b>. A signal channel may be opened between any multiplexing port and any demultiplexing port, and one or more channels may be opened between any multiplexing port and any demultiplexing port. Different channels (including two adjacent channels) may have a same multiplexing port or different multiplexing ports, and different channels (including two adjacent channels) may also have a same demultiplexing port or different demultiplexing ports. For example, the channel ch<b>2</b> is opened between the demultiplexing port <b>402</b> and the multiplexing port <b>405</b>, and channels between the other demultiplexing ports and the multiplexing port <b>405</b> are in a blocked state (that is, in a closed state).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The technical solution in this embodiment of the present invention may be applied to the optical communication field, for example, a network scenario including a component that can implement spectrum resource allocation, such as a WSS. Because spectrum control precision of the WSS is less than a spectrum width of a channel, flexible spectrum allocation can be performed according to a relatively small spectrum granularity. In addition, in a wavelength division multiplexing network, an optical signal usually passes through a plurality of WSS components. If the WSSs are cascaded for wave-adding and wave-dropping, spectrum resources of some channels are unused. Therefore, if the unused spectrum resource is flexibly allocated to a to-be-opened channel, a channel bandwidth can be increased, to reduce channel damage caused by filtering costs, and improve service performance. Certainly, this embodiment of the present invention may be further applied to another type of communication network, for example, a wireless communication network or a telecommunication network, provided that flexible spectrum resource allocation can be implemented in a scenario.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart of a channel opening method according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The network management system may initiate a channel opening command, and specify a to-be-opened channel as the channel ch<b>2</b> in the opening command. After receiving the channel opening command, the node determines the adjacent channel of the current to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b> based on the to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b>. The adjacent channel may include one or two channels (for example, a channel ch<b>1</b> and a channel ch<b>3</b>). Original spectrum resources of the adjacent channel are adjacent to original spectrum resources of the to-be- opened channel ch<b>2</b>. For example, the node determines the original spectrum resources of the to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b>, for example, slices 5 to 8, and determines the adjacent channel of the to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b> based on the original spectrum resources of the to-be-opened channel ch<b>2</b>.
