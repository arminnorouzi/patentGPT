More particularly, embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods for depositing high purity metal films having low oxygen content and low carbon content.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor processing industry continues to strive for larger production yields while increasing the uniformity of layers deposited on substrates having larger surface areas. These same factors in combination with new materials also provide higher integration of circuits per unit area of the substrate. As circuit integration increases, the need for greater uniformity and process control regarding layer thickness rises. As a result, various technologies have been developed to deposit layers on substrates in a cost-effective manner, while maintaining control over the characteristics of the layer.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is one of the most common deposition processes employed for depositing layers on a substrate. CVD is a flux-dependent deposition technique that requires precise control of the substrate temperature and the precursors introduced into the processing chamber in order to produce a desired layer of uniform thickness. These requirements become more critical as substrate size increases, creating a need for more complexity in chamber design and gas flow technique to maintain adequate uniformity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variant of CVD that demonstrates excellent step coverage is cyclical deposition or atomic layer deposition (ALD). Cyclical deposition is based upon atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and employs chemisorption techniques to deliver precursor molecules on a substrate surface in sequential cycles. The cycle exposes the substrate surface to a precursor, a purge gas, a reactant and the purge gas. The precursor and the reactant react to form a product compound as a film on the substrate surface. The cycle is repeated to form the layer to a desired thickness. Some cycles expose the substrate surface to a precursor, a purge gas, a reactant, and the purge gas, and expose the film having the product compound to a reductant to form a deposited film (e.g., a metal film).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The advancing complexity of advanced microelectronic devices is placing stringent demands on currently used deposition techniques. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of viable chemical precursors available that have the requisite properties of robust thermal stability, high reactivity, and vapor pressure suitable for film growth to occur. In addition, precursors that often meet these requirements, e.g., organometallic precursors, lead to deposition reactions that produce metal-carbon bonds that are difficult to reduce. Current processes include oxidizing metal-carbon bonds to form metal-oxygen bonds to deposit a metal film. Metal-oxygen bonds are also difficult to reduce to deposit a metal film. Halogen-containing reactants, for example, convert the metal-carbon bonds to metal-halogen bonds. It is believed that metal-halogen bonds are more easily reduced than metal-carbon bonds and metal-oxygen bonds to deposit the metal film.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is, therefore, a need in the art for reductants to enable selective deposition of high purity metal films.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method of depositing a film comprising exposing a substrate surface to an organometallic precursor and an iodine-containing reactant to form a carbon-less iodine-containing metal film.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods of depositing a film comprising exposing a substrate surface to an organometallic precursor comprising a metal selected from the group consisting of molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), osmium (Os), rhenium (Re), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni) and ruthenium (Ru) and an iodine-containing reactant comprising a species having a formula RI<sub>x</sub>, where R is one or more of a C<sub>0</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group and x is in a range of 1 to 4 to form a carbon-less iodine-containing metal film; and exposing the carbon-less iodine-containing metal film to a reductant to form a metal film.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method of depositing a film comprising exposing a substrate surface to an organometallic precursor comprising molybdenum (Mo) and an iodine-containing reactant comprising diiodomethane (CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>) to form a carbon-less iodine-containing metal film; and exposing the carbon-less iodine-containing metal film to a reductant comprising hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) to form a metal film, wherein the metal film comprises greater than or equal to 90% metal species on an atomic basis, and wherein the metal film has a resistivity less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;&#x3a9;-cm.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The disclosure is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a surface, or portion of a surface, upon which a process acts. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that reference to a substrate can also refer to only a portion of the substrate, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Additionally, reference to depositing on a substrate can mean both a bare substrate and a substrate with one or more films or features deposited or formed thereon.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A &#x201c;substrate&#x201d;, &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d;, or the like, as used herein, refers to any substrate or material surface formed on a substrate upon which processing is performed. For example, a substrate surface on which processing can be performed include, but are not limited to, materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, strained silicon, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, silicon nitride, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, and any other materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, and other conductive materials, depending on the application. Substrates include, without limitation, semiconductor wafers. Substrates may be exposed to a pretreatment process to polish, etch, reduce, oxidize, hydroxylate (or otherwise generate or graft target chemical moieties to impart chemical functionality), anneal and/or bake the substrate surface. In addition to processing directly on the surface of the substrate itself, in the present disclosure, any of the film processing steps disclosed may also be performed on an underlayer formed on the substrate as disclosed in more detail below, and the term &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include such underlayer as the context indicates. Thus for example, where a film/layer or partial film/layer has been deposited onto a substrate surface, the exposed surface of the newly deposited film/layer becomes the substrate surface. What a given substrate surface comprises will depend on what materials are to be deposited, as well as the particular chemistry used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, a &#x201c;substrate surface&#x201d; refers to any substrate surface upon which a layer may be formed. The substrate surface may have one or more features formed therein, one or more layers formed thereon, and combinations thereof. The substrate (or substrate surface) may be pretreated prior to the deposition of the transition metal-containing layer, for example, by polishing, etching, reduction, oxidation, halogenation, hydroxylation, annealing, baking, or the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The substrate may be any substrate capable of having material deposited thereon, such as a silicon substrate, a III-V compound substrate, a silicon germanium (SiGe) substrate, an epi-substrate, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, a display substrate such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), a plasma display, an electro luminescence (EL) lamp display, a solar array, solar panel, a light emitting diode (LED) substrate, a semiconductor wafer, or the like. In some embodiments, one or more additional layers may be disposed on the substrate such that the transition metal-containing layer may be at least partially formed thereon. For example, in some embodiments, a layer comprising a metal, a nitride, an oxide, or the like, or combinations thereof may be disposed on the substrate and may have the transition metal-containing layer formed upon such layer or layers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one or more embodiments, the term &#x201c;on&#x201d;, with respect to a film or a layer of a film, includes the film or layer being directly on a surface, for example, a substrate surface, as well as there being one or more underlayers between the film or layer and the surface, for example the substrate surface. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;on the substrate surface&#x201d; is intended to include one or more underlayers. In other embodiments, the phrase &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; refers to a layer or a film that is in contact with a surface, for example, a substrate surface, with no intervening layers. Thus, the phrase &#x201c;a layer directly on the substrate surface&#x201d; refers to a layer in direct contact with the substrate surface with no layers in between.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one or more embodiments, the method uses an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. In such embodiments, the substrate surface is exposed to the precursors (or reactive gases) sequentially or substantially sequentially. As used herein throughout the specification, &#x201c;substantially sequentially&#x201d; means that a majority of the duration of a precursor exposure does not overlap with the exposure to a co-reagent, although there may be some overlap.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactant&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably to refer to any gaseous species that can react with the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x201c;Atomic layer deposition&#x201d; or &#x201c;cyclical deposition&#x201d; as used herein refers to the sequential exposure of two or more reactive compounds to deposit a layer of material on a substrate surface. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;reactive compound&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive gas&#x201d;, &#x201c;reactive species&#x201d;, &#x201c;precursor&#x201d;, &#x201c;process gas&#x201d; and the like are used interchangeably to mean a substance with a species capable of reacting with the substrate surface or material on the substrate surface in a surface reaction (e.g., chemisorption, oxidation, reduction). The substrate, or portion of the substrate, is exposed separately to the two or more reactive compounds which are introduced into a reaction zone of a processing chamber. In a time-domain ALD process, exposure to each reactive compound is separated by a time delay to allow each compound to adhere and/or react on the substrate surface and then be purged from the processing chamber. These reactive compounds are said to be exposed to the substrate sequentially. In a spatial ALD process, different portions of the substrate surface, or material on the substrate surface, are exposed simultaneously to the two or more reactive compounds so that any given point on the substrate is substantially not exposed to more than one reactive compound simultaneously. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; used in this respect means, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, that there is the possibility that a small portion of the substrate may be exposed to multiple reactive gases simultaneously due to diffusion, and that the simultaneous exposure is unintended.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect of a time-domain ALD process, a first reactive gas (i.e., a first precursor or compound A) is pulsed into the reaction zone followed by a first time delay. Next, a second precursor or compound B is pulsed into the reaction zone followed by a second delay. During each time delay, a purge gas, such as argon, is introduced into the processing chamber to purge the reaction zone or otherwise remove any residual reactive compound or reaction by-products from the reaction zone. Alternatively, the purge gas may flow continuously throughout the deposition process so that only the purge gas flows during the time delay between pulses of reactive compounds. The reactive compounds are alternatively pulsed until a desired film or film thickness is formed on the substrate surface. In either scenario, the ALD process of pulsing compound A, purge gas, compound B and purge gas is a cycle. A cycle can start with either compound A or compound B and continue the respective order of the cycle until achieving a film with the desired thickness. In some embodiments, there may be two reactants, A and B, that are alternatingly pulsed and purged. In other embodiments, there may be three or more reactants, A, B, and C, that are alternatingly pulsed and purged.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment of a spatial ALD process, a first reactive gas and second reactive gas (e.g., metal precursor gas) are delivered simultaneously to the reaction zone but are separated by an inert gas curtain and/or a vacuum curtain. The substrate is moved relative to the gas delivery apparatus so that any given point on the substrate is exposed to the first reactive gas and the second reactive gas.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to a method <b>100</b> of depositing a film. The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is representative of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process in which the substrate or substrate surface is exposed sequentially to the reactive gases in a manner that prevents or minimizes gas phase reactions of the reactive gases. In some embodiments, the method comprises a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process in which the reactive gases are mixed in the processing chamber to allow gas phase reactions of the reactive gases and deposition of the thin film.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the method <b>100</b> optionally includes a pre-treatment operation <b>105</b>.

The methods of various embodiments use atomic layer deposition (ALD) to provide pure or nearly pure metal films.

Some embodiments of the disclosure provide methods of selectively depositing metal films on a dielectric surface over a metal surface. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;selectively depositing a film on one surface over another surface&#x201d;, and the like, means that a first amount of the film is deposited on the first surface and a second amount of film is deposited on the second surface, where the second amount of film is less than the first amount of film, or no film is deposited on the second surface.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term &#x201c;over&#x201d; used in this regard does not imply a physical orientation of one surface on top of another surface, rather a relationship of the thermodynamic or kinetic properties of the chemical reaction with one surface relative to the other surface. For example, selectively depositing a molybdenum film onto a metal surface over a dielectric surface means that the molybdenum film deposits on the metal surface and less or no molybdenum film deposits on the dielectric surface; or that the formation of a molybdenum film on the metal surface is thermodynamically or kinetically favorable relative to the formation of a molybdenum film on the dielectric surface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The selectivity of a deposition process is generally expressed as a multiple of growth rate. For example, if one surface film is grown (or deposited on) 25 times thicker than a different surface, the process would be described as having a selectivity of 25:1.

Some embodiments of this disclosure advantageously provide metal films which conformally fill gaps without a seam.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In spatial ALD embodiments, exposure to each of the process gases occurs simultaneously to different parts of the substrate so that one part of the substrate is exposed to the first reactive gas while a different part of the substrate is exposed to the second reactive gas (if only two reactive gases are used). The substrate is moved relative to the gas delivery system so that each point on the substrate is sequentially exposed to both the first and second reactive gases. In any embodiment of a time-domain ALD or spatial ALD process, the sequence may be repeated until a predetermined layer thickness is formed on the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Some embodiments of the disclosure are directed to processes that use a reaction chamber with multiple gas ports that can be used for introduction of different chemicals or plasma gases. Spatially, these gas ports (also referred to as channels) are separated by inert purging gases and/or vacuum pumping holes to create a gas curtain that minimizes or eliminates mixing of gases from different gas ports to avoid unwanted gas phase reactions. Wafers moving through these different spatially separated ports get sequential and multiple surface exposures to different chemical or plasma environment so that layer by layer film growth in spatial ALD mode or surface etching process occur.

Dose times may also vary based upon the type of layer being formed and the geometry of the device being formed. A dose time should be long enough to provide a volume of compound sufficient to adsorb/chemisorb onto substantially the entire surface of the substrate and form a layer of a process gas component thereon.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">One or more embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods of depositing metal films in high aspect ratio features. A high aspect ratio feature is a trench, via or pillar having a height:width ratio greater than or equal to about 10, 20, or 50, or more.
