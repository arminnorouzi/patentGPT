Upon receipt of the electronic message, the user opens the message and opens the attachment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Messaging application <b>28</b> may be a client based application, such as an email application, an instant messaging application, a social media application, and the like. Generally, messaging application <b>28</b> is used to send and receive electronic messages of one or more types. A network based messaging service <b>40</b> may be used in addition to messaging application <b>28</b> or instead of one or more of the different messaging applications. For example, a web interface may be used to access messaging service <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Messaging service <b>40</b> may be used to process electronic messages between one or more of the computing devices <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. Messaging service <b>40</b> may be configured to process different message types, such as SMS, MMS, email, messages for social networks and the like. Messaging service <b>40</b> may be configured with the functionality of the attachment manager <b>26</b> and one or more message types may be used to communicate the electronic messages including the attachments.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Computing device <b>220</b> includes one or more applications, such as a web browser <b>30</b> that may be configured to access a messaging service, such as a web based email service and to interact with content. For example, a web browser may be used to access an electronic message through an email service and then access content <b>232</b> stored in network share <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Attachment manager <b>26</b> is configured to detect any attachments that are included with an electronic message. The attachments may be any type of content, such as word processing documents, spreadsheets, slides, images, video, website content and the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an electronic message <b>300</b> including an attachment.

The electronic message <b>300</b> may be accessed a number of ways. For example, web browser <b>30</b> may access an electronic mail service, an email application on a computing device may be configured to receive emails from one or more different services, and the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one aspect of a user interface <b>400</b> of a messaging application such as messaging application <b>28</b>. The example term &#x201c;Ferret&#x201d; is entered into a search field <b>410</b> and the search query is performed via the messaging application. Suggested search results <b>420</b> are provided that include other suggested search terms <b>430</b> for the search field <b>410</b> and suggested identification information <b>440</b> for another person, other people or entities that may be related to the search term &#x201c;Ferret.&#x201d; Additional people on entities may also be searched for from the suggested search results <b>420</b>. Thus, in response to a search query, the suggested search results <b>420</b> may include attachments, suggested search terms, and identification of another person or entity. Each suggested search result is selectable. However, messages associated with the information of the suggested search results including attachments are not required to be opened in order to perform the search query or to provide the suggested search results <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the suggested search results <b>420</b> also include attachments <b>450</b>. The attachments <b>450</b> are identified and provided via the attachment manager <b>26</b> to the suggested search results <b>420</b> of the message application <b>28</b>. One or more of the attachments may have been received within a message through the messaging application <b>28</b>. One or more other attachments may instead be from other than the messaging application <b>28</b> such as elsewhere in the computer <b>20</b> or from an external source over a network such as the Internet <b>32</b>. The external source may be the messaging service <b>40</b>. Additional attachments may also be searched for from the suggested search results <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to the search results <b>420</b>, the user interface <b>400</b> may also include message previews <b>460</b> of messages that are managed by the messaging application <b>28</b>. Also, one or more messages such as message <b>470</b> may be opened as a result of being selected to be displayed via the user interface <b>400</b>. Thus, the suggested search results <b>420</b> including attachments may be displayed alongside a preview of the messages that included the attachments when received through the messaging application <b>28</b> or may be displayed alongside the open messages that included the attachments when received through the messaging application <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also illustrates an attachment being selected by a cursor that is a document having an example file name &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs.&#x201d; In at least one aspect, selecting the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs&#x201d; results in opening the attachment in a user interface <b>500</b> such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. For example, the attachment may be opened by a word processing application on the computer <b>20</b> or by an online word processing application. Alternatively, the attachment may be opened in a file viewing application or an editing application such as POWERPOINT, EXCEL or another OFFICE application from MICROSOFT. Upon selecting and opening the attachment, the message that included the attachment when received by the messaging application <b>28</b> may also be displayed alongside or side-by-side the opened attachment in the user interface <b>500</b>. However, in one or more aspects, the messages associated with the attachments selected from the suggested search results are not required to be opened in order to open the attachments.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively, as shown in a user interface <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, selecting the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs&#x201d; results in the attachment being opened in an online word processing application. The attachment may be provided alongside the open message that originally included the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs&#x201d; when received by the messaging application <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates another alternative implementation occurring as a result of selecting an attachment from the suggested search results. In one or more aspects, selecting an attachment from the suggested search results does not necessarily result in opening the attachment. The user interface <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates that the selection of an attachment from the suggested search results in providing a message preview <b>710</b>. The message preview <b>710</b> corresponds with the original message that included the attachment, which in this case, is the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs.&#x201d; The message preview <b>710</b> may include highlighting of the searched term. For example, the term &#x201c;Ferret&#x201d; was searched as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and, therefore, the term &#x201c;Ferret&#x201d; is highlighted in the file name of the attachment in the message preview <b>710</b>. The highlighting of the term &#x201c;Ferret&#x201d; in the message preview <b>710</b> is indicated by the reference number <b>716</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Selecting an attachment from the suggested search results also may result in displaying a conversation <b>720</b> of messages related to the attachment. For example, the conversation <b>720</b> includes a chain of messages. The chain of messages includes the message that included the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs&#x201d; when received by the messaging application <b>28</b> as well as two other messages received in response to the original message with the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs.&#x201d; The two additional messages are associated with the message that included the selected attachment because they were submitted in response to the message with the attachment. One or more of the messages included in the conversation may be opened to display the message body. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the message with the attachment &#x201c;About Ferrets.docs&#x201d; is open. The user interface <b>700</b>, as well as one or more of the other user interfaces disclosed herein, may also include additional search parameters or filters which may be selected for refining the suggested search results.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a user interface <b>800</b> where selection of a suggested attachment from the suggested search results opens the suggested attachment in a word processing application and provides a summary information operation <b>810</b>. The summary information operation <b>810</b> may indicate the sender of the messaging having the selected attachment as well as the number of other related messages that are part of the conversation. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, opening a selected attachment from the suggested search results does not require that the associated message that included the attachment also be opened.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates one aspect of a process <b>900</b> for presenting search suggestions within a messaging application that include attachments without searching messages themselves for the attachments.
