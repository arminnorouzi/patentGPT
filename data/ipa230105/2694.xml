Moreover, a gear oil temperature rises due to heat generated by reduction in gear oil filling amount associated with downsizing of the unit, and oil film breakage due to reduction in viscosity tends to occur, and thus further durability is required for the gear oil.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gear oil that requires such durability has generally employed SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) viscosity number 90 in order to maintain oil film formation on a gear tooth surface.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, on the other hand, fuel saving is also required, and in order to achieve this, it is necessary to reduce stirring resistance and to reduce the viscosity in order to address this. In order to satisfy these requirements for both gear tooth surface protection and low viscosity, if a method of increasing an amount of extreme pressure additive added to low viscosity base oil based on the conventional method is employed, phosphorus/sulfur-based additives used as the extreme pressure additive increase adverse effects of corrosiveness on parts containing copper components, and there is a high risk of shortening equipment life. Therefore, an additive composition for the gear oil that reduces such corrosion of copper and copper alloys has also been proposed (Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also proposed is a technology that uses hydrocarbon-based synthetic oils and ester-based synthetic oils as the base oil to maintain the GL-5 level, while achieving low viscosity and achieving both durability and fuel saving (Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, a technique has also been proposed in which good seizure resistance of differential gear portion can be achieved by combining a Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil with a polyalphaolefin and an ester compound (Patent Literature 3). On the other hand, reduction in wear resistance of bearing due to reduction in viscosity requires counter-measures such as restriction of load conditions and change in structure of the bearing, and it was difficult to completely replace the gear unit that requires the conventional SAE viscosity number 90 with a low viscosity oil. Examples of wear of the bearing here include wear of a tapered roller bearing that supports a pinion gear on an input side of a hypoid gear. It is known that when the bearing is worn, a positional relationship between the pinion gear and a ring gear cannot be properly maintained, and as a result, the durability of the gear is reduced (Patent Literature 4).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, it is known that reduction in viscosity of the lubricating oil affects an oil film forming ability, and causes a problem of scoring on the gear tooth surface or the like, and it is required to achieve good scoring resistance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">[PTL 1]JP 2004-323850 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0010">[PTL 2]JP 2008-179780 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0011">[PTL 3]JP 2017-115038 A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0012">[PTL 4]JP 2007-100792 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide the lubricating oil composition that can be used as GL-5 level automotive gear oil or the like that can achieve good wear resistance and good scoring resistance of the bearing in addition to further fuel saving while maintaining durability and seizure resistance that can be used as the gear oil for a high-output, high-speed gear mechanism of a high-output automobile or the like.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0014">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition containing: a Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil having a kinematic viscosity at 100&#xb0; C. of 2 to 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s; a polyalphaolefin having a kinematic viscosity at 100&#xb0; C. of 400 to 700 mm<sup>2</sup>/s; an ester compound which is an ester of a trivalent or higher polyol having a kinematic viscosity at 100&#xb0; C. of 3 to 6 mm<sup>2</sup>/s; and a partial ester compound of an unsaturated fatty acid and a polyol.

In order to save fuel consumption of a gear mechanism, it is necessary to achieve a high balance between mainly three points (1) to reduce slip between gear tooth surfaces caused by contact between metals, (2) to reduce energy required for a rotating gear to stir lubricating oil, and (3) to reduce sliding friction that occurs between the gear tooth surfaces with a lubricating oil film therebetween under high pressure conditions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">In order to achieve such a balance, it is usually conceivable to take measures (1) for the above (1), to reduce friction coefficient by effectively utilizing an oil-based agent added, (2) for the above (2), to reduce viscosity by using a low viscosity base oil, and (3) for the above (3), to reduce traction coefficient by selecting a base oil having a small shearing force.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">In order to achieve good load bearing capacity, it is necessary, for example, (4) to form a strong metal film on the gear tooth surface by using an extreme pressure additive, and (5) to form an oil film that hinders contact between the metals. Further, retention of the oil film also affects fatigue life of a bearing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">In order to achieve such both fuel saving and load bearing capacity, it is one of important points to first select a main composition material of a lubricating oil composition. That is, a composition material having a low viscosity at a low temperature and a low stirring resistance, and a high viscosity at an extreme pressure state generated at high temperature is preferable. Those that are close to such a preferable composition material have a high viscosity index (VI) with a small change in viscosity with temperature, and a VI value of 160 or more is required, and particularly a high viscosity index of 180 or higher is required to achieve good seizure resistance and good wear resistance at high temperature.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">In order to improve the VI, a Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil can be mixed and used in addition to a polyalphaolefin, particularly a highly viscous polyalphaolefin and an ester base oil.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">In addition to such improvements in fuel saving and load bearing capacity, in order to improve the fatigue life in a differential gear of an automobile and the like, it is an effective means to mix and use the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil in addition to the polyalphaolefin and an ester compound. Further, in order to achieve good wear resistance of the bearing supporting a pinion gear, it is effective to mix and use a partial ester compound of an unsaturated fatty acid and a polyol in addition to the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil, the polyalphaolefin and the ester compound.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">Furthermore, in order to achieve good scoring resistance on the gear tooth surface and the like, it is effective to use a combination of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil having a low kinematic viscosity at high temperature, the polyalphaolefin having a high kinematic viscosity at high temperature, and the ester compound of a trivalent or higher polyol having a low kinematic viscosity at high temperature. Components of the present invention will be described below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">The Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil, which is a component (A-1) of the present invention, is known in the art. The term &#x201c;Fischer-Tropsch derived&#x201d; means that the base oil is a synthetic product of Fischer-Tropsch method or is derived from the synthetic product. The Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil can also be referred to as a Gas-To-Liquids (GTL) base oil. Suitable Fischer-Tropsch derived base oils that can be conveniently used as the base oil in the lubricating oil composition are disclosed, for example, in EP0776959, EP0668342, WO97/21788, WO00/15736, WO00/14188, WO00/14187, WO00/14183, WO00/14179, WO00/08115, WO99/41332, EP1029029, WO01/18156 and WO01/57166.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">The kinematic viscosity of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil is 2 to 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 100&#xb0; C. If the kinematic viscosity of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil at 100&#xb0; C. is less than 2 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, an amount of evaporation at high temperature is large, the viscosity of the composition is increased, and an effect of fuel saving is reduced. If the kinematic viscosity of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil at 100&#xb0; C. exceeds 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, it is not desirable because it is difficult to increase the VI of the composition by mixing with a high viscosity PAO.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">The kinematic viscosity of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil at 100&#xb0; C. is 2 to 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, preferably 2.5 to 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, and more preferably 2.5 to 3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s from a viewpoint of oil film formation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">The content of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil is 30 to 80 mass % based on a total mass (100 mass %) of the lubricating oil composition. If the content of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil is less than 30 mass %, in order for the lubricating oil composition to maintain the viscosity of about 25 to 45 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40&#xb0; C., a large amount of polyalphaolefin (PAO) having a high viscosity (400 to 700 mm<sup>2</sup>/s) is used and a ratio of synthetic oil is increased, which is not economical. If the content of the Fischer-Tropsch derived base oil exceeds 80 mass %, a blending amount of high viscosity polyalphaolefin (PAO) is limited, and it is necessary to increase a blending amount of a viscosity index improver in order to maintain the viscosity index of 160 or more of the composition while keeping the viscosity of the lubricating oil composition not more than 45 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is not economical.
