One example of a fluid pan is the engine oil pan.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fluid pans should be compact, but at the same time have the largest possible volume for receiving fluid.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The problem addressed by the invention is that of providing a fluid pan, whereof the volume for receiving fluid can be enlarged in a straightforward manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This problem is solved in accordance with the invention by a fluid pan, in particular an engine oil pan, for a motor vehicle, which has a main pan and a secondary pan which is separate from the main pan, wherein the main pan has a main space for fluid and a passage is provided on a side wall of the main pan. The secondary pan in this case has a secondary space and an opening, wherein the secondary pan is attached to an outer side of the main pan in such a manner that the opening in the secondary pan connects to the passage in the main pan, and the main space and the secondary space are thereby fluidically connected to one another. The secondary space of the secondary pan therefore represents a separate enlargement of the main space of the main pan. In this way, more fluid can be received in the fluid pan.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The passage in the main pan may be there for production-related reasons and must be tightly closed by a separate cover. This function is assumed by the secondary pan, which thereby simultaneously increases the total volume of the main pan. The secondary pan therefore has a dual function as a cover and as a means of increasing the volume.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Within the framework of this invention, a side wall is understood to mean a wall which delimits the main pan to the side, i.e. in a horizontal direction in the anticipated assembly position. In particular, the floor of the main pan does not represent a side wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, the main space is enlarged substantially laterally or, in other words, the secondary pan is attached to the main pan in such a manner that it projects substantially horizontally from a lateral side wall of the main pan. Accordingly, the main pan is not enlarged downwardly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect, the secondary pan can be attached to the outside of the main pan in a non-destructively detachable manner. Hence, the secondary pan can easily be mounted on the main pan or dismantled from said main pan, which is advantageous when the fluid is being changed, for example.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further aspect envisages that the passage is arranged at least partially, in particular completely, below a predefined maximum filling height of the main pan. Hence, the additional main space created by the secondary space can be efficiently utilized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the maximum filling height is selected in such a manner that no moved components, for example components of the crankshaft, splash about in the fluid received in the main space and secondary space. Air is thereby prevented from being introduced into the fluid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It may be provided that the secondary space is partially arranged in the predefined assembly position, in particular substantially completely above a lowest point of the opening. In this way, the secondary space can be prevented from having a dead volume of fluid, which remains in the secondary pan when the fluid level drops and, consequently, cannot be used for its actual purpose.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">By way of example, the secondary space of the secondary pan has a minimum volume of 0.1 liters, in particular 0.5 liters. Hence, an appreciable increase in volume of the main space can be achieved. The secondary pan is not therefore a &#x201c;flat cover&#x201d;, but contributes to the increase in volume of the main space.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One embodiment envisages that the passage is enclosed circumferentially by a contact face, and that the opening in the secondary pan is enclosed circumferentially by a contact face, wherein the contact faces rest against one another, or a seal, for example a flat seal or a paste-like seal, is provided between the contact faces. Hence, the main pan and the secondary pan can be attached to one another in a simple and, in particular, sealing manner, and the fluidic connection between the main space and the secondary space can thereby be created.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, one contact face is, or both contact faces are, designed in a flange-like manner. As a result, easier fastening can be guaranteed. Furthermore, separate fastening components, such as screws or rivets, for example, are more easily accessible from outside via the flange-like portion during fastening.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It may be provided that the main pan and the secondary pan are only fastened to one another via their contact faces. This allows simpler and easier assembly and dismantling, and additional separate components, such as fastening components, for example, can be dispensed with.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a further embodiment, at least one fastening means is provided, by way of which the secondary pan can be attached to the main pan, at least in the region of the opening in the secondary pan and the passage in the main pan. This makes it easier for the secondary pan to be mounted on, and dismantled from, the main pan, since the fastening means is easily accessible from outside.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The fastening means in this case may be integrally formed on the respective pan, as a result of which the corresponding pan can be produced in one process step.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It may be provided that the contact face of the main pan and/or the contact face of the secondary pan has the at least one fastening means, or that the contact face of the main pan and/or the contact face of the secondary pan is formed at least sectionally by the at least one fastening means. In other words, the fastening means may be at least an integral part of the contact face of the main pan and/or of the contact face of the secondary pan.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The secondary pan may be composed of at least two pan parts, each of which forms a part of the secondary space, in particular wherein the pan parts are two pan halves of the secondary pan. For more complex pan shapes of the secondary pan, production can be substantially simplified if multiple pan parts are produced individually and subsequently assembled into a secondary pan.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to ensure a tight and reliable connection between the individual pan parts, said pan parts may be connected to one another in a substance-bonded manner, for example by welding or adhering.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, the secondary pan may have an integral design, as a result of which fewer production steps are necessary and no additional tight connection has to be produced between the individual pan parts.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the main pan is made of metal or a metal alloy and a casting, in particular a pressure die-casting. In this way, a stable and resistant main pan can be produced cost-effectively.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It may be provided that a cross-sectional face of the passage in the main pan is substantially parallel to a main demolding direction of the main pan. In this context, &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; means a maximum deviation of the cross-sectional face of the passage from the parallel to the main demolding direction of at most 30&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The secondary pan is produced from a plastic and/or by injection-molding, for example. Hence, the secondary pan can be produced easily and cost-effectively and has a low empty weight.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One embodiment envisages that a cross-sectional face of the opening of the secondary pan is at most 10%, in particular at most 50%, of a side face of the secondary pan facing the main pan, or at least 90%, in particular at least 80%, of a side face of the secondary pan facing the main pan. In this way, the opening in the secondary pan can be adapted to the passage in the main pan, to which the secondary pan is attached.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the problem is solved by a motor vehicle which comprises an engine and a fluid pan of the aforementioned kind, in particular wherein the fluid pan is an engine oil pan of the engine. Fluid which is essential to the running of the motor vehicle can be collected in the fluid pan. Reliable running of the motor vehicle is thereby guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the fluid pan is an engine oil pan of the engine, in which the engine oil which is essential to lubricating and cooling the engine is received.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The motor vehicle may have at least one further vehicle component in the vicinity of the fluid pan, wherein the shape of the secondary pan is adapted to the at least one adjacent vehicle component, in such a manner that the secondary pan fills, at least partially, in particular predominantly, the space between the main pan and the at least one vehicle component. In this way, the installation space within the vehicle can be optimally utilized.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">So that even more installation space can be used by the secondary pan to increase the volume of the main pan, the secondary pan may be formed in the region of the at least one vehicle part, at least partially matching the vehicle component.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In particular, the secondary pan has an at least sectionally curved design and at least partially encloses at least one adjacent vehicle component. The available installation space can therefore be utilized efficiently and optimally.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The advantages and features of the fluid pan according to the invention which are described apply in the same way to the motor vehicle according to the invention, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further advantages and features of the invention result from the following description and also from the attached drawings, to which reference is made.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic sectional view of a front region of a motor vehicle according to the invention with a fluid pan according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the fluid pan according to the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a main pan and a first embodiment of a secondary pan according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a second embodiment of the secondary pan according to the invention of the fluid pan according to the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exploded view of a third embodiment of a fluid pan according to the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a main pan and two secondary pans according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A front region of a motor vehicle <b>10</b>, in which an engine <b>12</b>, a fluid pan <b>14</b> associated with the engine <b>12</b>, into which fluid can be filled up to a maximum filling height M, and a further vehicle component <b>16</b> are arranged is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the fluid pan <b>14</b> is an engine oil pan of the engine <b>12</b> and the further vehicle component <b>16</b> is part of a wheel suspension of the motor vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fluid pan <b>14</b> comprises a main pan <b>18</b>, which has a main space <b>20</b>, and a secondary pan <b>22</b> separate from the main pan <b>18</b>, which has a secondary space <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The directional information used in the following relates to the correct assembly position of the fluid pan <b>14</b> in the motor vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A passage <b>28</b>, to which the secondary pan <b>22</b> is fastened in a non-destructively detachable manner, such that said passage <b>28</b> and the opening <b>30</b> are aligned with one another and the main space <b>20</b> and the secondary space <b>24</b> are thereby fluidically connected to one another, is formed on one side wall <b>26</b>, i.e. a lateral outer side, of the main pan <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, the secondary pan <b>22</b> is not fastened to an underside of the main pan <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the fluid pan <b>14</b> with the main pan <b>18</b>, the secondary pan <b>22</b>, and fastening components <b>40</b>.
