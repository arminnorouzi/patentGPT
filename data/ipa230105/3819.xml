Further, the disclosure relates to an MR control sequence determination device and an MR imaging system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the help of modern imaging methods, two- or three-dimensional image data are often generated that can be used to visualize a patient to be imaged, for example a person or an animal, and also for other applications. A special type of medical imaging is implemented using Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetic resonance imaging is a medical imaging technique that provides diagnostically relevant information of biological tissue. Its diagnostic relevance originates from the informative power and versatility of this imaging modality, which offers differentiated and precise structure information in a non-invasive fashion. Magnetic resonance imaging is based on the controlled manipulation of nuclear spins inside a patient's body and subsequent detection of the nuclear spin response. The space-dependent encoding of the spin response allows for a reconstruction of the patient's structural composition and functional constitution for the radiologist to perform diagnostic reading.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a magnetic resonance system, the body to be examined is usually exposed to a relatively high basic magnetic field, for example of 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla or 7 Tesla, with the aid of a basic field magnet system. After applying the basic magnetic field, nuclei in the examination object align themselves with a non-vanishing nuclear magnetic dipole moment, often also called spin, along the basic field. This collective behavior of the spin system is described by the macroscopic &#x201c;magnetization&#x201d;. The macroscopic magnetization is the vector sum of all microscopic magnetic moments in the object at a certain location. In addition to the basic field, a gradient system is used to apply a magnetic field gradient by means of which the magnetic resonance frequency (Larmor frequency) is determined at the respective location.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Radio-frequency excitation signals (referred to interchangeably herein as RF or high-frequency (HF) pulses) are then transmitted via a high frequency transmission system using suitable antenna devices, which should lead to that the nuclear spins of certain nuclei excited by this high-frequency field (i.e. at the Larmor frequency present at the respective location) around a defined area Flip angles are tilted relative to the magnetic field lines of the basic magnetic field. If such an RF pulse acts on spins that are already excited, they can be turned over into a different angular position or even folded back into an initial state parallel to the basic magnetic field. During the relaxation of the excited nuclear spins, high-frequency signals, so-called magnetic resonance signals, are emitted resonantly, which are received by means of suitable receiving antennas (also called magnetic resonance coils or receiving coils), then demodulated and digitized and then processed further as so-called &#x201c;raw data&#x201d;. The acquisition of the magnetic resonance signals takes place in the spatial frequency space, the so-called &#x201c;k-space&#x201d;, wherein during a measurement, for example of a slice, the k-space is traversed over time along a &#x201c;gradient trajectory&#x201d; (also called &#x201c;k-space trajectory&#x201d;) defined by the switching of the gradient pulses. In addition, the RF pulses must be sent out at a suitable time. From the raw data acquired in this way, after further processing steps, which as a rule also depend on the acquisition method, the desired image data can finally be reconstructed by means of a two-dimensional Fourier transformation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternatively, three-dimensional volumes can now also be excited and read out in a defined manner, the raw data in turn being sorted into a three-dimensional k-space after further processing steps. A three-dimensional image data volume can then be reconstructed using a three-dimensional Fourier transformation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Usually, certain predetermined pulse sequences are used to control a magnetic resonance tomography system during the measurement, i.e. sequences of defined RF pulses and gradient pulses in different directions and readout windows, during which the receiving antennas are switched to receive and the magnetic resonance signals are received and processed. With the help of a so-called measurement protocol, these sequences are parameterized in advance for a desired examination, for example a specific contrast of the calculated images. The measurement protocol can also contain further control data for the measurement. There are a number of magnetic resonance sequence techniques according to which pulse sequences can be constructed. One of the great challenges facing future developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MR imaging) is an acceleration of magnetic resonance sequence techniques without extensive compromises in terms of resolution, contrast and susceptibility to artifacts.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current clinical MR imaging is based almost exclusively on so-called Cartesian or right-angled (rectilinear) imaging, in which the scanned k-space points (i.e. the scanning points in k-space, where raw data are recorded) lie on the grid points of a rectangular grid or pattern.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In doing so, so-called parallel imaging methods have succeeded in significantly accelerating clinical MR imaging. In the case of a special variant of parallel MR imaging, called compressed sensing, the data acquisition is shortened in that some of the lines of the grid that are actually necessary for reconstructing an image free of convolution are not acquired in k-space. These missing lines are later substituted during the image reconstruction in k-space or the convolution artifacts resulting from the undersampling are removed in the image space. A prerequisite for being able to use the parallel imaging methods is the reception of the high-frequency signals with several receiving coils (antennas), whereby the spatial sensitivity of the individual receiving coils must be known. The spatial sensitivity of the receiving coils is calculated with the help of so-called coil calibration data. The coil calibration data must usually be sufficiently sampled. Since the sensitivities generally vary slowly in space, it is usually sufficient, if the coil calibration data have a low spatial resolution. Typically, the coil calibration data must be remeasured for each patient.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One of the most important parallel imaging methods is the so-called GRAPPA method, as it is described e.g. in the article &#x201c;Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA)&#x201d; by Marc Griswold et al. in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 47, 2002, pp. 1202-1210.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For parallel imaging in general, or Compressed Sensing in particular, a variable density undersampling scheme is beneficial to image quality in accelerated MRI. With this approach, the central part of k-space is sampled more densely, whereas more lines or points in the periphery are left out. There are potential benefits to combining Compressed Sensing with rapid acquisition techniques based on Echo-Planar-Imaging, abbreviated as EPI. However, standard EPI is not compatible with variable-density undersampling because it disrupts the phase evolution of an off-resonant signal, leading to image artifacts.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Spatial encoding with EPI is achieved by sampling signals during rapid gradient switching, which generates a zig-zag trajectory in k-space. This trajectory has a discrepancy between the readout direction (kx), abbreviated as RO-direction and the phase-encoding direction (ky), abbreviated as PE-direction. Along the RO-direction, k-space is sampled quickly using high gradient strengths, whereas along the PE-direction, small gradient blips are applied at regular intervals corresponding to a low sampling rate in k-space. At tissue interfaces, for example at the boundary between water and air in the frontal cortex in the human brain, strong differences in susceptibility can arise. This has the effect of contributing background magnetic-field gradients, which can be comparable in magnitude to the blipped PE gradients. This perturbs the k-space trajectory for signals emanating from this region of tissue, which leads to spatial distortion in the final image.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To reduce these distortions, parallel imaging can be applied, which uses regular undersampling to shorten the echo train and thereby the time taken to traverse k-space in the PE direction. This effectively increases the amplitude of the blipped PE gradients relative to the background gradients and reduces their effect. Similarly, multi-shot, segmented-k-space techniques can also be used to reduce the length of the echo train, albeit at the cost of an overall increase in scan time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">There is a problem that the EPI methods described above rely on a regular sampling in k-space to preserve image quality, and this is incompatible with the compressed sensing (CS) requirement for variable-density undersampling. This is because the variable sampling would result in uneven steps in k-space that do not match the constant phase evolution of off-resonant signals, a particular issue in regions with background magnetic-field gradients. In effect, this produces spatial distortion that is a function of spatial frequency, causing a smearing and loss of detail in the final image.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One possible way is to always have the minimum amplitude of the blipped PE gradient above a certain threshold so that no distortions appear at all during the acquisition. Above that threshold, then a variable density undersampling pattern can be implemented. However, due to the need for a lower threshold, the length of the echo train cannot be longer than about <b>11</b> echoes. That reduces the overall acquisition speed and does thereby not make this method applicable to applications where imaging speed is crucial, like functional MRI (fMRI) or diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There is therefore the problem of developing a fast MR imaging method with sufficient image quality.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This object is achieved by an EPI magnetic resonance imaging method combined with a variable-density undersampling scheme according to the embodiments as described herein, including the claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The EPI magnetic resonance imaging method combined with a variable-density undersampling scheme according to the disclosure comprises the steps of generating an RF-pulse, applying a switched frequency-encoding read out gradient in a variable time interval, and applying simultaneously an intermittently blipped low-magnitude phase-encoding gradient with a variable value of an integral of the phase-encoding gradient. A variable time interval means that the time interval of at least two of the read out gradients played out, comprises a different value. A variable value of an integral of a phase-encoding gradient means that the values of the integrals of at least two of the phase-encoding gradients played out are different than each other. The aforementioned steps are carried out such that the k-space is at least partially undersampled and the time interval of one read out gradient is varied depending on a value of an integral of the phase encoding gradient such that a ratio between the variable time interval of the read out gradient and the value of the integral of the corresponding phase encoding gradient is kept above or at a predetermined constant value, which is related to a predetermined criteria of image quality. The time interval of one read out gradient is also named echo spacing. The value of the integral of the phase encoding gradient is directly proportional to the local undersampling factor in k-space. The ratio between the variable time interval of the read out gradient and the value of an integral of the corresponding phase encoding gradient is named effective echo spacing. The effective echo spacing can also be defined as the ratio between the echo spacing of a read out gradient and an undersampling factor. The variation of echo spacing corresponding to the undersampling factor is also named as echo-spacing shuffling.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Advantageously, the method according to the disclosure allows a combination of an undersampling scheme with an EPI acquisition scheme, which acquires large segments of k-space at each excitation using a long echo train. Such a combination provides a further reduction in scan time. Since the effective echo-spacing is maintained over a predetermined value, image quality is maintained at a predetermined level, although the undersampling scheme changes throughout the k-space. Hence, it is possible to use an arbitrary variable-density undersampling scheme combined with an EPI pulse sequence without the introduction of image artifacts of a higher amount than is predetermined in advance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The MR control sequence determination device according to the disclosure comprises an RF-pulse generating unit for playing out (i.e. transmitting) an RF-pulse, a gradient generating unit for generating a switched frequency-encoding read out gradient in a variable time interval and simultaneously generating an intermittently blipped low-magnitude phase-encoding gradient with a variable amplitude or variable value of an integral of the phase-encoding gradient. The gradient generating unit is designed to play out (i.e. transmit) the gradients such that the k-space is at least partially undersampled and the time interval of one read out gradient is varied depending on the value of the integral of the phase encoding gradient such that a ratio between the variable time interval of the read out gradient and the value of the integral of the corresponding phase encoding gradient is kept above or at a predetermined constant value, which is related to a predetermined criteria of image quality. The gradient generating unit shares the advantages of the EPI magnetic resonance imaging method according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The MR imaging system comprises a scan unit and an MR control sequence determination device according to the disclosure. The MR imaging system shares the advantages of the MR control sequence determination device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some of the components of the MR control sequence determination device according to the disclosure can be designed for the most part in the form of software components. This applies in particular to parts of the gradient generating unit and the RF-pulse generating unit. In principle, however, some of these components can also be implemented in the form of software-supported hardware, for example FPGAs or the like, e.g. when it comes to particularly fast calculations. Likewise, the required interfaces, for example if it is only a matter of transferring data from other software components, can be designed as software interfaces. However, they can also be designed as hardware-based interfaces that are controlled by suitable software.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A largely software-based implementation has the advantage that computer units or control units of MR imaging systems that have already been used can easily be retrofitted by a software update to work in the manner according to the disclosure. In this respect, the object is also achieved by a corresponding computer program product with a computer program, which can be loaded directly into a memory device of a computer unit or a control unit of an MR imaging system and which includes program sections to carry out all steps to execute the method according to the disclosure when the computer program is executed in the computer unit or control unit of the MR imaging system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition to the computer program, such a computer program product can optionally include additional components such as documentation and/or additional components, including hardware components such as hardware keys (dongles, etc.) for using the software.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A computer-readable medium, for example a memory stick, a hard disk, or any other suitable transportable or permanently installed data carrier, on which program sections of the computer program that can be read in and executed are stored, can be used for transport to the storage device of a computer unit of an MR imaging system and/or for storage on the computer unit of the MR imaging system. The computer unit can, for example, have one or more cooperating microprocessors or similar for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantageous configurations and developments of the disclosure result from the dependent claims as well as the following description and the figures, in which the independent claims of one claim category can also be developed analogously to the dependent claims of another claim category and their description parts.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment of the EPI magnetic resonance imaging method according to the disclosure, the amplitude of the phase-encoding gradient is variable and the time interval of one read out gradient is varied depending on the amplitude of a corresponding phase encoding gradient, such that a ratio between the variable time interval of the read out gradient and the amplitude of the corresponding phase encoding gradient is kept above or at a predetermined constant value, which is related to a predetermined criteria of image quality. In the aforementioned variant, the phase-encoding gradient comprises a shape, wherein the amplitude is proportional to the value of an integral of the phase encoding gradient. That is, for example, the case for a rectangular or triangular shaped phase encoding gradient.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment of the EPI magnetic resonance imaging method according to the disclosure, the ratio between the variable time interval of the read out gradient and the value of the integral and/or the amplitude of the corresponding phase encoding gradient is kept throughout the whole sampling of k-space above or at the predetermined constant value.

In the upper line, a RF-pulse RF depending on the time is shown, which is transmitted in combination with a readout pulse GR, which is shown in the third line. A first echo is generated by transmitting a blipped phase encoding gradient GP with a first low amplitude A, which is shown in the second line, and after that a read out gradient GR with a short echo spacing time, which is proportional to the low amplitude of the phase encoding gradient GP is generated. Next, a blipped phase encoding gradient GP with an amplitude, which is two times as high as the first amplitude of a blipped phase encoding gradient GP, is transmitted. Then, a read out gradient GR is transmitted with a longer echo spacing time, which is proportional to the amplitude or to the value of the integral of the assigned phase encoding gradient GP.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, a blipped phase encoding gradient GP is transmitted with a low amplitude, and after that a read out gradient GR is transmitted with a short echo spacing time EST. Next, a blipped phase encoding gradient GP is transmitted with a high amplitude, which is three times as high as the low amplitude of the preceding blipped phase encoding gradient GP and after that, a corresponding readout gradient GR is transmitted with a long echo spacing time EST, which is three times as long as the echo spacing time EST of the preceding read out gradient GR. At last, a blipped phase encoding gradient GP is transmitted, which is two times as high as a low amplitude phase encoding gradient GP and a corresponding readout gradient GR is transmitted, which is two times as long as a short read out gradient GR. Hence, the effective echo spacing, which is the ratio between the amplitude or the value of the integral of a phase encoding gradient GP and the echo spacing time EST of the following read out gradient GR, is constant. A constant effective echo spacing results in a predetermined image quality.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a k-space trajectory corresponding to the pulse sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is illustrated. As can be taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an undersampling is realized by leaving out (i.e. not sampling) the dashed lines of k-space. Further, the length of a portion of the k-space trajectory in ky direction, i.e. in phase encoding direction is proportional to the length of the following portion of the k-space trajectory in kx-direction. Since the undersampling varies, also the length of the trajectory in kx-direction varies such that the ratio between the length of a portion of the trajectory in kx-direction and the preceding portion of the trajectory in ky-direction is constant. This results in a constant effective echo spacing. It is noted that the effective echo spacing may also be higher than a predetermined constant, such that a quality of an image is higher than a minimum requirement. Indeed, a higher effective echo spacing leads to a longer echo spacing time or a reduced undersampling factor, which means that an imaging process needs more time and/or an acquisition a higher amount of raw data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Finally, it is pointed out once again that the methods and devices described in detail above are only exemplary embodiments, which can be modified in various ways by the person skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
