As such, AVs will need to perform many of the functions that are conventionally performed by human drivers, such as performing navigation and routing tasks necessary to provide safe and efficient transportation.

The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a more thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced without these details. In some instances, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described herein, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of data available from various sources to improve quality and experience. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information. The present disclosure contemplates that the entities involved with such personal information respect and value privacy policies and practices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One way to improve various aspects of autonomous vehicle (AV) performance, such as navigation and routing functions, is to simulate AV operations for various driving scenarios. The simulation of such scenarios can be performed in a virtual environment, such as a three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment that can be used to generate synthetic AV sensor data. Because the goal of improving AV operations is to improve AV safety and performance in real-word environments, it is beneficial to accurately replicate the characteristics of real-world locations when generating virtual environments used for simulation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Aspects of the disclosed technology address the foregoing need by providing solutions for accurately replicating real-world lighting characteristics in virtual environments. In some approaches, the disclosed technology provides a novel process for capturing image data for a particular location, such as a city (e.g., San Francisco or Los Angeles), and for using real-world lighting characteristics (e.g., image parameters) extracted from the image data to generate highly-accurate virtual environments. As discussed in further detail below, AV performance for specific locations can be greatly enhanced by improving the correspondence between the virtual environments in which AV simulations are executed, and their real-world counterpart locals.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> conceptually illustrates an example system <b>100</b> for rendering a virtual environment using real-world lighting parameters. System <b>100</b> includes an image acquisition process <b>102</b>, that includes the capture of one or more images for a particular geographic location (e.g., Los Angeles). In some aspects, image acquisition <b>102</b> can include the association of geolocation metadata (e.g., geolocation coordinates) with the captured images. Associations with other types of metadata can also be performed, such as metadata indicating a time of day, time of year (date), and/or weather data. By way of example, weather data may indicate an amount of cloud cover, an air quality index, humidity information, an ambient barometric pressure, and/or other indicators of visibility.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some aspects, image acquisition <b>102</b> can include captures of a sky or other portions of an outdoor space using an image capture device (e.g., a camera) that has been directionally calibrated. By way of example, the camera may be directionally calibrated such that the camera center is aligned in a specific cardinal direction, e.g., north (N), east (E), south (S), or west (W), or any gradation therein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some aspects, camera calibration can also include color calibration. By way of example, color calibration can be facilitated by placing one or more color charts (e.g., a ColorChecker), such as a Macbeth chart in the view of one or more image frames. In some aspects, at least one color chart may be placed within a usable view of the camera in direct light, whereas one or more other color charts may be placed in locations away from direct light, such as in the shade.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some approaches, image acquisition <b>102</b> can include the capture of a panoramic image, such as a panoramic image of the sky and/or surrounding environs. The process of image capture <b>102</b> can also be augmented by one or more survey measurements of the corresponding geolocation, such as one or more measures of sunlight intensity lux values, color temperatures, e.g., in degrees Kelvin (K), and/or azimuth and elevation angles. Survey measurements can be stored as image-associated metadata.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The acquired images can then be pre-processed (<b>104</b>), e.g., to combine and linearize the acquired images into a continuous (panoramic) image. Preprocessing <b>104</b> can further include steps to adjust/scale color values, as discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some aspects, various image parameters, such as dynamic range and/or color value information, geolocation coordinates, timestamps, and/or dates, etc., can be identified and/or extracted from the acquired images (block <b>106</b>). In some aspects, the image parameters can be provided as input to a rendering engine, such as a 3D graphics application that is configured to render images that can be used to produce a virtual environment or scene.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a conceptual diagram <b>200</b> of steps for pre-processing and importing one or more acquired images into a graphics application, e.g., for use in rendering a virtual 3D scene. At block <b>202</b>, multiple captured images are combined and linearized, e.g., to produce a contiguous panoramic image comprised of the acquired images. In some approaches, the resulting high-definition image can then be adjusted or repositioned to align with a particular direction marker, such as a direction marker indicating a cardinal direction, e.g., North (block <b>204</b>). Subsequently, a color value reference image is selected, either from an image containing a color chart or from an absolute chart of color values. In some aspects, the reference image can be automatically selected from a set of acquired images, for example, using a machine-learning model that is configured to identify an optimal color reference image from among multiple images in an image set. Using the color value reference image, a color difference between the reference image and the panoramic image can be calculated, and used to transform/calibrate the entirety of the image data (block <b>208</b>). Once color calibration has been performed, the dynamic range of the calibrated image data is scaled (block <b>210</b>), and imported into a graphics application, such as a graphics application that includes a 3D graphics engine (block <b>212</b>). In some aspects, the imported images can be associated with various image parameters, for example, that indicate a location (e.g., lat/long coordinates), and a time of day and/or year. When rendering the virtual scene based on the imported image data (block <b>214</b>), the image parameter information can be used to adjust visual characteristics of the resulting virtual environment. For example, geolocation information, times of day, and/or times of year (date information) can be used to determine where luminance sources (e.g., representations of the sun or other features) should be placed within the sky of the virtual environment. Similarly, image parameters, such as dynamic range and/or color temperature values, can be used to adjust similar image characteristics in the virtual environment, for a corresponding location. As such, virtual representations of Los Angeles can accurately map to color characteristics and light intensity values for Los Angeles, Calif., while also accounting for a time day/year, etc.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example process <b>300</b> for using real-world lighting parameters to generate a virtual environment. Process <b>300</b> begins with step <b>302</b> in which a first plurality of images is aggregated, and wherein each of the images is associated with a first set of geolocation coordinates.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At step <b>304</b>, the process <b>300</b> includes extracting (or identifying) a first set of image parameters from the images. As discussed above, the image parameters can include metadata describing image characteristics, including but not limited to dynamic range and/or color temperature values that are representative of the aggregated images. In some aspects, image parameters can also include geolocation information that corresponds with a location where image capture was performed (e.g., lat/long information of the camera).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">At step <b>306</b>, the process <b>300</b> includes providing the image data for the aggregated first plurality of images and/or the first set of image parameters to a modeling platform. By way of example, the modeling platform can include a graphics application that is configured to render images to generate a virtual 3D environment (step <b>308</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of an AV management system <b>500</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, for the AV management system <b>400</b> and any system discussed in the present disclosure, there can be additional or fewer components in similar or alternative configurations. The illustrations and examples provided in the present disclosure are for conciseness and clarity. Other embodiments may include different numbers and/or types of elements, but one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such variations do not depart from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this example, the AV management system <b>400</b> includes an AV <b>402</b>, a data center <b>450</b>, and a client computing device <b>470</b>. The AV <b>402</b>, the data center <b>450</b>, and the client computing device <b>470</b> can communicate with one another over one or more networks (not shown), such as a public network (e.g., the Internet, an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) network, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) network, a Software as a Service (SaaS) network, other Cloud Service Provider (CSP) network, etc.), a private network (e.g., a Local Area Network (LAN), a private cloud, a Virtual Private Network (VPN), etc.), and/or a hybrid network (e.g., a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud network, etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">AV <b>402</b> can navigate about roadways without a human driver based on sensor signals generated by multiple sensor systems <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, and <b>408</b>. The sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> can include different types of sensors and can be arranged about the AV <b>402</b>. For instance, the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> can comprise Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras (e.g., still image cameras, video cameras, etc.), light sensors (e.g., LIDAR systems, ambient light sensors, infrared sensors, etc.), RADAR systems, GPS receivers, audio sensors (e.g., microphones, Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) systems, ultrasonic sensors, etc.), engine sensors, speedometers, tachometers, odometers, altimeters, tilt sensors, impact sensors, airbag sensors, seat occupancy sensors, open/closed door sensors, tire pressure sensors, rain sensors, and so forth. For example, the sensor system <b>404</b> can be a camera system, the sensor system <b>406</b> can be a LIDAR system, and the sensor system <b>408</b> can be a RADAR system. Other embodiments may include any other number and type of sensors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">AV <b>402</b> can also include several mechanical systems that can be used to maneuver or operate AV <b>402</b>. For instance, the mechanical systems can include vehicle propulsion system <b>430</b>, braking system <b>432</b>, steering system <b>434</b>, safety system <b>436</b>, and cabin system <b>438</b>, among other systems. Vehicle propulsion system <b>430</b> can include an electric motor, an internal combustion engine, or both. The braking system <b>432</b> can include an engine brake, brake pads, actuators, and/or any other suitable componentry configured to assist in decelerating AV <b>402</b>. The steering system <b>434</b> can include suitable componentry configured to control the direction of movement of the AV <b>402</b> during navigation. Safety system <b>436</b> can include lights and signal indicators, a parking brake, airbags, and so forth. The cabin system <b>438</b> can include cabin temperature control systems, in-cabin entertainment systems, and so forth. In some embodiments, the AV <b>402</b> may not include human driver actuators (e.g., steering wheel, handbrake, foot brake pedal, foot accelerator pedal, turn signal lever, window wipers, etc.) for controlling the AV <b>402</b>. Instead, the cabin system <b>438</b> can include one or more client interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), etc.) for controlling certain aspects of the mechanical systems <b>430</b>-<b>438</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">AV <b>402</b> can additionally include a local computing device <b>410</b> that is in communication with the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, the mechanical systems <b>430</b>-<b>438</b>, the data center <b>450</b>, and the client computing device <b>470</b>, among other systems. The local computing device <b>410</b> can include one or more processors and memory, including instructions that can be executed by the one or more processors. The instructions can make up one or more software stacks or components responsible for controlling the AV <b>402</b>; communicating with the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, and other systems; receiving inputs from riders, passengers, and other entities within the AV's environment; logging metrics collected by the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>; and so forth. In this example, the local computing device <b>410</b> includes a perception stack <b>412</b>, a mapping and localization stack <b>414</b>, a planning stack <b>416</b>, a control stack <b>418</b>, a communications stack <b>420</b>, an HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, and an AV operational database <b>424</b>, among other stacks and systems.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Perception stack <b>412</b> can enable the AV <b>402</b> to &#x201c;see&#x201d; (e.g., via cameras, LIDAR sensors, infrared sensors, etc.), &#x201c;hear&#x201d; (e.g., via microphones, ultrasonic sensors, RADAR, etc.), and &#x201c;feel&#x201d; (e.g., pressure sensors, force sensors, impact sensors, etc.) its environment using information from the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, the mapping and localization stack <b>414</b>, the HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, other components of the AV, and other data sources (e.g., the data center <b>450</b>, the client computing device <b>470</b>, third-party data sources, etc.). The perception stack <b>412</b> can detect and classify objects and determine their current and predicted locations, speeds, directions, and the like. In addition, the perception stack <b>412</b> can determine the free space around the AV <b>402</b> (e.g., to maintain a safe distance from other objects, change lanes, park the AV, etc.). The perception stack <b>412</b> can also identify environmental uncertainties, such as where to look for moving objects, flag areas that may be obscured or blocked from view, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mapping and localization stack <b>414</b> can determine the AV's position and orientation (pose) using different methods from multiple systems (e.g., GPS, IMUs, cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic sensors, the HD geospatial database <b>422</b>, etc.). For example, in some embodiments, the AV <b>402</b> can compare sensor data captured in real-time by the sensor systems <b>404</b>-<b>408</b> to data in the HD geospatial database <b>422</b> to determine its precise (e.g., accurate to the order of a few centimeters or less) position and orientation. The AV <b>402</b> can focus its search based on sensor data from one or more first sensor systems (e.g., GPS) by matching sensor data from one or more second sensor systems (e.g., LIDAR). If the mapping and localization information from one system is unavailable, the AV <b>402</b> can use mapping and localization information from a redundant system and/or from remote data sources.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The planning stack <b>416</b> can determine how to maneuver or operate the AV <b>402</b> safely and efficiently in its environment. For example, the planning stack <b>416</b> can include an AV routing system that is configured to identify and select navigation routes. By way of example, the planning stack <b>416</b> can receive the location, speed, and direction of the AV <b>402</b>, geospatial data, data regarding objects sharing the road with the AV <b>402</b> (e.g., pedestrians, bicycles, vehicles, ambulances, buses, cable cars, trains, traffic lights, lanes, road markings, etc.) or certain events occurring during a trip (e.g., emergency vehicle blaring a siren, intersections, occluded areas, street closures for construction or street repairs, double-parked cars, etc.), traffic rules and other safety standards or practices for the road, user input, and other relevant data for directing the AV <b>402</b> from one point to another. The planning stack <b>416</b> can determine multiple sets of one or more mechanical operations that the AV <b>402</b> can perform (e.g., go straight at a specified rate of acceleration, including maintaining the same speed or decelerating; turn on the left blinker, decelerate if the AV is above a threshold range for turning, and turn left; turn on the right blinker, accelerate if the AV is stopped or below the threshold range for turning, and turn right; decelerate until completely stopped and reverse; etc.), and select the best one to meet changing road conditions and events. If something unexpected happens, the planning stack <b>416</b> can select from multiple backup plans to carry out. For example, while preparing to change lanes to turn right at an intersection, another vehicle may aggressively cut into the destination lane, making the lane change unsafe. The planning stack <b>416</b> could have already determined an alternative plan for such an event, and upon its occurrence, help to direct the AV <b>402</b> to go around the block instead of blocking a current lane while waiting for an opening to change lanes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control stack <b>418</b> can manage the operation of the vehicle propulsion system <b>430</b>, the braking system <b>432</b>, the steering system <b>434</b>, the safety system <b>436</b>, and the cabin system <b>438</b>.

The lanes and boundaries layer can also include 3D attributes related to lanes (e.g., slope, elevation, curvature, etc.). The intersections layer can include geospatial information of intersections (e.g., crosswalks, stop lines, turning lane centerlines and/or boundaries, etc.) and related attributes (e.g., permissive, protected/permissive, or protected only left turn lanes; legal or illegal U-turn lanes; permissive or protected only right turn lanes; etc.).
