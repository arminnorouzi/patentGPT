Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a vehicle control device that controls an air conditioning device and a battery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, as a vehicle control device, there is one described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2021-40378 (JP 2021-40378 A). This vehicle control device increases the upper limit of the battery output when the air conditioning device is in the high load state. As a result, even when the accelerator pedal is greatly depressed in the high load state of air conditioning, a large amount of electric power can be supplied from the battery to the drive motor.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the control of the vehicle control device, there is a possibility that the battery temperature increases when the air conditioning is in a high load state, and the battery deteriorates. However, the battery deterioration due to such an increase in the battery temperature can also occur in vehicles that cool that battery by air conditioning.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Specifically, in a vehicle that cools the battery by air conditioning, when the control is performed to prohibit battery cooling for a certain period of time when the air conditioning is in a high load state, the cooling performance of the air conditioning device is preferentially used for cooling the passenger compartment. As a result, the cooling performance of the vehicle cabin is less likely to deteriorate, and it is easy to ensure the comfort of the occupant. However, when such a control is performed in an area where the outside air temperature is high, for example, the Middle East, the battery temperature may become excessively high and the battery may deteriorate. Thus, there is a case in which battery cooling cannot be prohibited. Thus, there is case in which the cooling performance of the vehicle cabin may be lowered by the amount in which battery cooling is performed, and the comfort of the occupant is lowered.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a vehicle control device in which deterioration of the cooling performance can be suppressed and battery deterioration due to an increase in a battery temperature can be suppressed when air conditioning is in a high load state in a vehicle in which battery cooling is performance by air conditioning.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above problems, a vehicle control device according to the present disclosure is a vehicle control device that controls an air conditioning device and a battery in a vehicle that uses a coolant of the air conditioning device that cools a vehicle cabin for cooling the battery, the vehicle control device including: an air conditioning load determination unit that determines whether the air conditioning device is driven by a predetermined load or more; and a battery input-output control unit that controls at least one of an input power or an output power of the battery, in which when the air conditioning device is driven by the predetermined load or more, at least one of the input power or the output power is restricted without cooling the battery.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present disclosure, the battery is not cooled when the air conditioning device is driven by a predetermined load or more. Thus, when the air conditioning device is driven by a predetermined load or more, the cooling performance of the air conditioning device used for cooling the battery can be used for cooling the vehicle cabin, and the comfort of the occupants can be easily ensured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, when the air conditioning device is driven by a predetermined load or more, since at least one of the input power and the output power in the battery is restricted, the heat generation of the battery can be suppressed and the deterioration of the battery due to the rise in the battery temperature can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the vehicle control device according to the present disclosure, the vehicle control device may further include: an outside air temperature detection unit that detects an outside air temperature of the vehicle; and an outside air temperature determination unit that determines whether the outside air temperature is lower than a predetermined temperature, in which when the outside air temperature is lower than the predetermined temperature, the input power and the output power may not restricted.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present configuration, the input power and the output power to the battery is not restricted in the situation where the outside air temperature at which the battery temperature does not easily rise is less than a predetermined temperature. Thus, it is possible to suppress excessive restriction of the input power and the output power in the battery, and it is possible to suppress deterioration of the running performance due to the restriction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the vehicle control device according to the present disclosure, the vehicle control device may further include: a battery temperature detection unit that detects a temperature of the battery; and a battery temperature determination unit that determines whether the temperature of the battery is lower than a predetermined temperature, in which when the temperature of the battery is lower than the predetermined temperature and the air conditioning device is driven by the predetermined load or more, the input power and the output power may not be restricted.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present configuration, since the input power and the output power in the battery can be restricted in consideration of the temperature of the battery, it is possible to suppress the excessive restriction of the input power and the output power.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the vehicle control device according to the present disclosure, when the air conditioning device is driven by the predetermined load or more, only a supply of power to the battery may be restricted and an output of power from the battery may not be restricted.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present configuration, by restricting only the input of power to the battery, it is possible to suppress the rise in battery temperature while reducing the deterioration of running performance due to the restriction of the output of the battery.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the vehicle control device according to the present disclosure, deterioration of the cooling performance can be suppressed and battery deterioration due to an increase in a battery temperature can be suppressed when air conditioning is in a high load state in a vehicle in which battery cooling is performance by air conditioning.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like signs denote like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic configuration diagram of a vehicle according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of an air conditioning device;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a control block diagram of a vehicle control device; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of control of a vehicle control device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, embodiments according to the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The input restriction to the battery <b>11</b> when the air conditioning device <b>20</b> is driven by the predetermined load or more may be an input restriction to the battery <b>11</b>, in comparison with the above-mentioned normal control. For example, when the threshold value (maximum value) of the DC power that can be input to the battery <b>11</b> is set in the above normal control, the restriction of the power supply to the battery <b>11</b> when the air conditioning device <b>20</b> is driven by the predetermined load or more may be realized by lowering the threshold value more than the threshold value in the normal control.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, when the output of the electric power from the battery <b>11</b> is restricted, the restriction may be realized by setting the DC power output by the battery <b>11</b> to the predetermined DC power or less. Alternatively, the output limit from the battery <b>11</b> may be varied based on the battery temperature, for example, the maximum value of the DC power output by the battery <b>11</b> may be decreased continuously or stepwise as the battery temperature increases. The output restriction from the battery <b>11</b> when the air conditioning device <b>20</b> is driven by the predetermined load or more may be restricted to the output from the battery <b>11</b>, in comparison with the above-mentioned normal control.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">When Air Conditioning Device is Driven by Predetermined Load or More and at Least Either Condition that Outside Air Temperature is Below Predetermined Temperature or Condition that Battery Temperature is Below Predetermined Temperature is Satisfied</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of the air conditioning control and the battery control performed by the vehicle control device <b>50</b>.
