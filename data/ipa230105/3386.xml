In order to achieve efficient combustion, it is desired to atomize or vaporize the fuel to cause the fuel and the air to be mixed in favorable manner.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventionally known fuel nozzle device includes a nozzle body formed in a substantially tubular shape extending in an axial direction and a swirler positioned around the outer periphery of the nozzle body to define an air passage inclined in the circumferential direction with respect to the axial direction. In such a fuel nozzle device, the fuel ejected into the combustion chamber via the nozzle body and the air introduced into the combustion chamber through the air passage are mixed, and the obtained air-fuel mixture is combusted in the combustion chamber to generate combustion gas. At this time, since the air passage is inclined in the circumferential direction with respect to the axial direction, the air passing through the air passage is formed into a swirl flow centered around the axis so that the fuel and the air can be mixed well. Normally, the steeper the inclination angle of the air passage is with respect to the axial line, the stronger the air passing through the air passage is swirled, and the better the mixing efficiency of the fuel and the air becomes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, since such a swirl passage is formed by a plurality of swirl vanes that extend in a spiral shape around the axis, a high cost is required to integrally form such swirl vanes. Further, even if the swirl vanes are each divided into a plurality of segments that are bonded, welded or otherwise joined to one another, the joining of the individual segments require a high cost and special equipment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a technology for overcoming this problem, JP2011-528074A discloses a fuel nozzle device fitted with a swirler consisting of a plurality of swirl vanes formed in an airfoil shape by using an additive manufacturing process such as a laser sintering process. According to this prior art, a swirler having a complicated shape can be integrally formed with a relatively low manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the additive manufacturing technology runs into a difficulty when the inclination angle of the spiral swirl vanes with respect to a cross sectional plane is smaller than a prescribed angle, or the stacking angle (relative to the plane orthogonal to the axial direction) is smaller than a prescribed angle (the limit stacking angle &#x3b2;<sub>min</sub>). For instance, surface roughness becomes unacceptably great as the stacking angle is reduced. More importantly, when the stacking angle is too small, there is a risk of the vane collapsing during the additive manufacturing process, and a shoring arrangement will become necessary to successfully complete the additive manufacturing process. This further necessitates the removal of the shoring arrangement upon completion of the additive manufacturing process so that the manufacturing cost tends to be undesirably high.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, according to the prior art, there is a limit to the inclination angle of the swirl vanes of the swirler, and the fuel cannot be atomized as finely as desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of such a problem of the prior art, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a fuel nozzle device for a gas turbine engine that can be manufactured at low cost by using an additive manufacturing process and can satisfactorily mix fuel and air.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to overcome this problem, one aspect of the present invention provides a fuel nozzle device (<b>100</b>) for injecting fuel into a combustion chamber (<b>52</b>) of a gas turbine engine, comprising; a nozzle body (<b>102</b>) extending in an axial direction and projecting into the combustion chamber; and a swirler (<b>103</b>) including a tubular portion (<b>119</b>) concentrically surrounding the nozzle body, a deflector (<b>104</b>) formed as a hollow shell concentrically surrounding the tubular portion, and a plurality of swirl vanes (<b>123</b>) extending between the tubular portion and the deflector, each swirl vane extending along a logarithmic spiral around an axial center of the nozzle body between the tubular portion and the deflector with a certain meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; and a certain twist angle &#x3a6; as measured from a leading edge to a trailing edge of the swirl vane such that an outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; as represented by &#x3b8;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6;)) is smaller than a stacking angle of the swirl vane as represented by &#x3b2;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6; cos &#x3b1;)), where L is the chord length L of the swirl vane as measured in the axial direction, and r is the outer diameter of the tubular portion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the swirl vanes are fabricated by an additive fabrication process in a front end up orientation, the stacking angle &#x3b2; of the swirl vanes can be thus made greater than the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; of the swirl vanes. Preferably, the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; is smaller than 45 degrees. Thereby, it is possible to reduce the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; while maintaining the stacking angle &#x3b2; of the swirl vanes to be equal to or greater than the limit stacking angle &#x3b2; by appropriately selecting the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; and the twist angle &#x3a6;. By reducing the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8;, the air passing through air passages defined between the swirl vanes can be strongly swirled so that the mixing efficiency of the fuel and the air is improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, an annular space is defined between an outer periphery of the nozzle body and the tubular portion, and a plurality of additional swirl vanes (<b>122</b>) extend between the nozzle body and the tubular portion, each additional swirl vane extending along a logarithmic spiral around an axial center of the nozzle body between the nozzle body and the tubular portion with a certain meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; and a certain twist angle &#x3a6; as measured from a leading edge to a trailing edge of the swirl vane such that an outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; as represented by &#x3b8;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6;)) is smaller than a stacking angle of the swirl vane as represented by &#x3b2;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6; cos &#x3b1;)), where L is the chord length L of the swirl vane as measured in the axial direction, and r is the inner diameter of the central cylinder.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">By thus providing two sets of swirl vanes in a concentric relationship, a swirl air flow can be generated in an even more favorable manner.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the logarithmic spiral of the additional swirl vanes extends circumferentially in an opposite direction to that of the swirl vanes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thereby, a swirl air flow can be generated in an even more favorable manner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of the present invention provides a fuel nozzle device (<b>100</b>) for injecting fuel into a combustion chamber (<b>52</b>) of a gas turbine engine, comprising; a nozzle body (<b>102</b>) extending in an axial direction and projecting into the combustion chamber, the nozzle body having an annular configuration so as to include a central cylinder (<b>106</b>) internally defining a central air flow passage; and a swirler (<b>99</b>) including a plurality of swirl vanes (<b>111</b>) extending radially inward from the central cylinder, each swirl vane extending along a logarithmic spiral around an axial center of the nozzle body with a certain meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; and a certain twist angle &#x3a6; as measured from a leading edge to a trailing edge of the swirl vane such that an outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; as represented by &#x3b8;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6;)) is smaller than a stacking angle of the swirl vane as represented by &#x3b2;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6; cos &#x3b1;)), where L is the chord length L of the swirl vane as measured in the axial direction, and r is the inner diameter of the central cylinder.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the swirl vanes are fabricated by an additive fabrication process in a front end up orientation, the stacking angle &#x3b2; of the swirl vanes can be thus made greater than the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; of the swirl vanes.

The thickness of the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> of this embodiment is substantially constant over the entire axial length.

The outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; in the first embodiment is less than 45 degrees. As the outer peripheral inclination angle &#x3b8; approaches 0 degrees, the inclination angle of the air passage defined between the outer swirl vanes <b>123</b> approaches 90 degrees so that the twisting force of the compressed air passing through the air passage increases.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the shapes of the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> and the second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b> are defined by a meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; [deg] which is defined by a line extending from the central axis A to an arbitrary point on the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> (second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b>) on the cross sectional plane S<b>1</b> and a tangent line of the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> (second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b>) at this point. Therefore, the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; is equal to the complementary angle of the pitch angle of the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> (the second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b>). As the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; comes closer to zero, the distance of the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> and the second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b> to the central axis A approaches at a faster rate. Conversely, as the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; comes closer to 90 degrees, the distance of the first logarithmic spiral <b>129</b> and the second logarithmic spiral <b>130</b> to the central axis A approaches at a slower rate.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> is inclined with respect to the cross sectional plane S<b>2</b> by a stacking angle &#x3b2; [deg] which is related to the chord length L of the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> in the axial direction, the outer peripheral radius r of the tubular portion <b>119</b>, the twist angle &#x3a6;, and the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; as represented by &#x3b2;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6; cos &#x3b1;)). The stacking angle &#x3b2; is an angle by which the swirler <b>103</b> is laminated or stacked up from the rear end to the front end by using an additive manufacturing process. The closer the stacking angle &#x3b2; is to 0 degrees, the more difficult it becomes to manufacture the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> by using the additive manufacturing process. In particular, when the stacking angle &#x3b2; is less than a certain limit stacking angle &#x3b2;<sub>min</sub>, a support portion for shoring or supporting the laminated part is required in order to manufacture the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> having a high molding accuracy by using the additive manufacturing process. The stacking angle &#x3b2; in the first embodiment may be 45 degrees or more (the limit stacking angle &#x3b2;<sub>min</sub>=45 degrees).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, by setting the stacking angle &#x3b2; of the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> to the limit stacking angle &#x3b2;<sub>min </sub>or greater, additive manufacturing can be performed to manufacture the outer swirl vane <b>123</b> without requiring a support portion for supporting the outer swirl vane <b>123</b>. The same is true with the inner swirl vanes <b>122</b> (and the swirl vanes <b>111</b> of the inner swirler <b>99</b>). In the case of the inner swirl vanes <b>122</b> (and the swirl vanes <b>111</b> of the inner swirler <b>99</b>), r in the equation &#x3b2;=arctan (L/(r&#x3a6; cos &#x3b1;)) is the inner diameter of the tubular portion <b>119</b>. By this providing both the twist angle &#x3a6;, and the meridian crossing angle &#x3b1; to the swirl vanes, the effective swirl angle of the swirl vanes can be increased to be substantially greater than the stacking angle. As a result, the cost required for preparing and removing the support portion and the like can be eliminated so that the manufacturing cost of the fuel nozzle device <b>100</b> can be minimized.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The mode of operation of the fuel nozzle device <b>100</b> will be described in the following with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The fuel then passes through the second fuel passage <b>115</b> and the third fuel passage <b>116</b>, and is introduced into the fourth fuel passage <b>117</b>. In this conjunction, since the third fuel passage <b>116</b> is inclined in the circumferential direction with respect to the central axis A, the fuel introduced into the fourth fuel passage <b>117</b> turns into a swirling flow centered around the central axis A.

At this time, since the swirl vanes <b>111</b> are inclined in the circumferential direction with respect to the axial direction, the compressed air introduced into the central air flow passage <b>112</b> turns into a swirling flow centered around the central axis A.

Since the inner swirl vanes <b>122</b> and the outer swirl vanes <b>123</b> are inclined in the circumferential direction with respect to the axial direction (in mutually opposite directions in this embodiment), the compressed air passing through the inner swirl vanes <b>122</b> and the outer swirl vanes <b>123</b> is swirled around the central axis A. These swirling flows cause the air-fuel mixture ejected from the opening on the front end of the second intermediate cylinder <b>108</b> to be in a favorably mixed state.
