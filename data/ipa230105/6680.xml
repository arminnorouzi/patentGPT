For example, the output clock may desirably be phase-locked to the reference clock. An undesirably large phase difference may occur, however, due to, for example, noise that infects the PLL. The reference clock may be susceptible to noise. Further, noise may infect the PLL through the PLL's power supply. Regardless of the source of noise or the reason for a large phase deviation between the input and output clocks to occur, any downstream circuitry that relies on the PLL's output clock being phase-locked to the input reference clock may be detrimentally impacted by the use of an output clock from the PLL that has &#x201c;slipped.&#x201d; The output clock from the PLL is characterized as being in a &#x201c;lock&#x201d; state or a &#x201c;slip&#x201d; state. The lock state means that the phase difference between the output and reference clocks is less than a prescribed threshold. The slip state means that the phase difference is larger than the prescribed threshold and the PLL is also referred to in this state as having &#x201c;lost lock.&#x201d; The disclosed examples are directed to a slip detect circuit for a PLL. The slip detect circuit determines whether the PLL has achieved lock or whether the PLL has slipped. A LOCK signal generated by the slip detect circuit indicates whether the PLL is in lock (e.g., LOCK asserted high) or whether the PLL has slipped (e.g., LOCK asserted low).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a PLL <b>100</b> including a phase-frequency detector (PFD) <b>102</b>, a loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b>, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) <b>106</b>, a frequency divider <b>108</b>, and a lock-slip detect circuit <b>120</b>. In this example, the lock-slip detect circuit <b>120</b> includes a low pass filter (LPF) <b>122</b>, a data (D) flip-flop <b>130</b>, an inverter <b>132</b>, and a lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b>. A reference clock (REF_CLK) <b>101</b> is provided to an input of the PFD <b>102</b>. The frequency of an output clock (CLK_OUT) <b>107</b> is divided down by a frequency divider <b>108</b> to generate a feedback clock (FB_CLK) <b>109</b>, which is also provided to another input of the PFD <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The PFD <b>102</b> is coupled to the loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b> and generates output signals UP <b>105</b> and DN <b>103</b> to the loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b>. In one example, UP <b>105</b> is asserted high by the PFD <b>102</b> when FB_CLK <b>109</b> lags REF_CLK <b>101</b>, and DN <b>103</b> is asserted high by the PFD <b>102</b> when FB_CLK <b>109</b> leads REF_CLK <b>101</b>. An asserted high UP <b>105</b> causes the loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b> to produce a voltage to the VCO <b>106</b> so as to increase its output frequency to thereby reduce the phase difference between FB_CLK <b>109</b> and REF_CLK <b>101</b>. An asserted high DN <b>103</b> causes the loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b> to produce a voltage to the VCO <b>106</b> so as to decrease its output frequency. The frequency divider <b>108</b> is included in the example in which the CLK_OUT from the VCO <b>106</b> has a frequency that is greater than REF_CLK <b>101</b>. In examples in which CLK_OUT <b>107</b> has the same frequency as REF_CLK <b>101</b>, a frequency divider is not used and the CLK_OUT is provided directly to the input of the PFD <b>102</b>. The output signal from the loop filter and charge pump <b>104</b> is provided to the VCO <b>106</b> and causes the VCO to increase or decrease the frequency of CLK OUT <b>107</b>. The feedback loop of the PLL <b>100</b> continually monitors the phase and frequency difference between FB_CLK <b>109</b> and REF_CLK <b>101</b> and responds to any difference by adjusting the operation of the VCO <b>106</b> to maintain phase lock.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As explained above, despite the attempts of the PLL <b>100</b> to maintain phase lock, the PLL may lose lock (slip). The lock-slip detect circuit <b>120</b> determines whether the PLL is in lock or has slipped and generates a LOCK signal <b>150</b> accordingly. In one implementation, LOCK is asserted high to indicate a lock condition and asserted low to indicate a slip condition. In another example, LOCK indicates whether the PLL is in lock, and a separate signal is generated by the lock-skip control circuit <b>140</b> to indicate slip. The QUASI SLIP signal <b>152</b> will be explained below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The PLL <b>100</b> of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also includes an OR gate <b>111</b> (or other type of logic gate(s)). OR gate <b>111</b> has inputs that are coupled to the PFD's outputs on which UP <b>105</b> and DN <b>103</b> are generated. Thus, OR gate <b>111</b> logically OR's UP <b>105</b> and DN <b>103</b> together to produce an output signal shown as A <b>115</b>. Whereas UP <b>105</b> and DN <b>103</b> indicate whether FB_CLK <b>109</b> lags or leads REF_CLK <b>101</b>, A <b>115</b> is indicative of the existence of a phase difference between the REF_CLK <b>101</b> and the FB_CLK <b>109</b> (without regard to differentiating between a phase lead or a phase lag). OR gate <b>111</b> may be separate from PFD <b>102</b>, or included as part of the PFD <b>102</b>. The A signal <b>115</b> generated by the PFD <b>102</b> is provided to the LPF <b>122</b>. An example of A <b>115</b> is shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and further explained below. The LPF <b>122</b> low pass filters A <b>115</b> to generate B <b>125</b>. An example of B <b>125</b> is shown in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and further explained below. The output of the LPF <b>122</b> is coupled to a clock input of the D flip-flop <b>130</b>. As such, B <b>125</b> is used to clock the D flip-flop <b>130</b>. The Q output of the D flip-flop <b>130</b> is coupled to an input of inverter <b>132</b>, and the output of the inverter <b>132</b> is coupled to the D input of the D flip-flop <b>130</b>. As such, each time the D flip-flop <b>130</b> is clocked by B <b>125</b> (e.g., a rising edge of B), the Q output of the D flip-flop <b>130</b> changes logic state. The signal produced by the Q output of the D flip-flop <b>130</b> is labeled UPDN <b>135</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. UPDN <b>135</b> is provided to an input of the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b>. The lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> comprises a hardware state machine comprising logic gates, counters (e.g., one or more counters <b>141</b>), flip-flops, etc. and generates LOCK <b>150</b> and QUASI SLIP <b>152</b> as will be explained above.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example timing diagram illustrating the operation of PLL <b>100</b>. The signals illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> include REF_CLK <b>101</b>, FB_CLK <b>109</b>, A <b>115</b>, B <b>125</b>, and UPDN <b>135</b>. Varying amounts of phase difference between REF_CLK <b>101</b> and FB_CLK <b>109</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Because A <b>115</b> is the logical OR of UP and DN, when REF_CLK <b>101</b> leads FB_CLK <b>109</b>, A <b>115</b> is asserted high upon the occurrence of a rising edge of REF_CLK <b>101</b> and deasserted upon the occurrence of a corresponding rising edge of FB_CLK <b>109</b>. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows pulses on A <b>115</b> at <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>214</b>. The widths of the pulses on A <b>115</b> are a function of the phase delay between REF_CLK <b>101</b> and FB_CLK <b>109</b>. For example, the width of pulse <b>202</b> is smaller than the width of pulse <b>204</b> because rising edges <b>220</b> and <b>221</b> of REF_CLK <b>101</b> and FB_CLK <b>109</b>, respectively, are closer together than rising edges <b>222</b> and <b>223</b>. The widths of pulses <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> are relatively large because of the relatively large phase difference between rising edges <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> of REF_CLK <b>101</b> and corresponding edges <b>225</b> and <b>227</b> of FB_CLK <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">LPF <b>122</b> generates B <b>125</b> based on A <b>115</b> (B <b>125</b> is a low-pass filtered version of A <b>115</b>). The frequency response of LPF <b>122</b> is configured to eliminate A's relatively narrow pulses <b>202</b> and <b>214</b> from being present in B <b>125</b>. Further, the relatively short duration negative pulse <b>207</b> also is filtered out of A <b>115</b> and thus not present in B <b>125</b>. The narrow duration pulses <b>202</b> and <b>214</b> represent corresponding clock cycles of REF_CLK <b>101</b> and FB_CLK <b>109</b> that are less than a threshold amount of phase difference and thus considered to be &#x201c;in phase&#x201d; (lock). The pulses <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, and <b>246</b> that are present in B <b>125</b> correspond to clock cycles of FB_CLK <b>109</b> that have a large enough phase difference in relation to REF_CLK <b>101</b> so as to be considered &#x201c;out of phase.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example implementation of the LPF <b>122</b>. In this example, the frequency response of the LPF <b>122</b> (e.g., its corner frequency) is configurable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the LPF <b>122</b> includes a buffer <b>301</b>, capacitors C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b>, and switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> (e.g., transistor switches). The input of buffer <b>301</b> is coupled to the PFD <b>102</b> to receive A <b>115</b>. The output of the buffer is coupled to capacitor C<b>0</b> and to switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Switch S<b>1</b> connects to capacitor C<b>1</b> and switch S<b>2</b> connects to capacitor C<b>2</b>. Capacitor C<b>0</b> is &#x201c;always on&#x201d; and capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> can be selectively enabled and disabled by controlling their respective switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. The LPF <b>122</b> implements an &#x201c;RC&#x201d; filter in which the on-resistance of buffer <b>301</b> provides the resistance for the filter and the effective capacitance enabled by control of switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> provides the capacitance for the filter. C<b>0</b> is always on and represents the minimum amount of capacitance for the filter. The filter capacitance can be increased by closing either or both of switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Additional switch and capacitor pairs can be included in other examples. In one example, the capacitance of C<b>1</b> equals that of C<b>0</b>, and the capacitance of C<b>2</b> is twice that of C<b>0</b>. The capacitor array of C<b>0</b>-C<b>2</b> (and other capacitors as desired) may comprise a binary-weighted capacitor array. The switches may be controlled by a digital value stored in a configuration register on the same semiconductor die as PLL <b>100</b>. In one example, with the switches open (off), the capacitance of C<b>0</b> may be such that the LPF <b>122</b> is configured to filter out pulses on A that have a width equal to or smaller than 500 picoseconds (ps). The pulse width that is filtered out by LPF <b>122</b> may be increased through closure of one or more of the switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows UPDN <b>135</b> produced by the D flip-flop <b>130</b>. Because the D flip-flop <b>130</b> in this example changes the state of its Q output (UPDN <b>135</b>) upon a rising edge of its clock input (B <b>125</b>), the D flip-flop <b>130</b> changes the logic state of UPDN <b>135</b> upon each occurrence of a rising edge of B <b>125</b>. As shown, rising edges <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> of B <b>125</b> cause UPDN <b>135</b> to change state as shown at <b>261</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>263</b>, and <b>264</b>. The counters <b>141</b> within the example lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> count edges (both rising and falling) of UPDN <b>135</b> to determine the occurrence of X UPDN edges in Y cycles of REF_CLK <b>101</b>. The values of X and Y are configured into the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> so that a slip is detected upon the occurrence of X or more edges of UPDN <b>135</b> in Y cycles of REF_CLK <b>101</b>. When that condition is met, LOCK <b>150</b> is asserted to a state (e.g., low) indicative of the slip state for PLL <b>100</b>. The REF_CLK <b>101</b> also is provided to the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b>. The minimum width of a pulse on UPDN <b>135</b> is the time duration of at least one cycle of REF_CLK <b>101</b>. As such, REF_CLK <b>101</b> can be used by a counter <b>141</b> to count edges of UPDN <b>135</b>, and a separate (higher frequency) clock is not needed for this purpose. The logic implemented by the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> to detect a lock condition and to detect a slip condition is described below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a sample of a state diagram <b>300</b> governing the operation of the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b>. The states shown in the sample state diagram <b>300</b> include IDLE <b>310</b>, SILENT COUNT <b>320</b>, LOCK COUNT <b>330</b>, LOCK WAIT <b>340</b>, and SLIP COUNT <b>350</b>. At power-on, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> starts in the IDLE state <b>310</b>, and then transitions to the SILENT COUNT state <b>320</b>. During the SILENT COUNT state <b>320</b>, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> counts pulses of the REF_CLK <b>101</b> corresponding to a BLANKING COUNT period of time. At power-on, it is possible for A <b>115</b> not to toggle between high and low due to a large initial phase difference between REF_CLK <b>101</b> and FB_CLK <b>109</b>, and if no pulses on A <b>115</b> are present, then the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> might determine that the PLL <b>100</b> is in lock when it has not yet locked CLK_OUT <b>107</b> to REF_CLK <b>101</b>. During the BLANKING COUNT period of time, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> does not count edges of UPDN <b>135</b> and thus does not determine if a slip condition has occurred, nor whether a lock condition has occurred.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Upon the BLANKING COUNT period of time ending, the IDLE state <b>310</b> is re-entered, and the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> remains in this state as long as no UPDN edges are detected. Upon the occurrence of the first UPDN edge following the end of the BLANKING COUNT period of time, the state transitions from the IDLE state <b>310</b> to the LOCK COUNT state <b>330</b>. While in the LOCK COUNT state <b>330</b>, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> counts for a REF COUNT period of time. In one example, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> counts pulses of REF_CLK corresponding to the REF COUNT period of time. REF COUNT represents a period of time during which the absence of any UPDN edges indicates that the PLL <b>100</b> has achieved lock. While in the LOCK COUNT state <b>330</b>, LOCK <b>150</b> is deasserted (to indicate that phase lock has not been yet been achieved). Upon detection of an UPDN edge, the counter which counts REF COUNT is reset.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the REF COUNT counter expires, which means no UPDN edge was detected, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> transitions to the LOCK WAIT state <b>340</b>. While in the LOCK WAIT state, LOCK <b>150</b> is asserted to indicate that PLL <b>100</b> has achieved lock. As long as no UPDN edges are detected, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> remains in the LOCK WAIT state <b>340</b>. Upon detection of an UPDN edge, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> transitions to the SLIP COUNT state <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While in the SLIP COUNT state <b>350</b>, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> counts cycles of REF_CLK <b>101</b> for a period of time Y. Over the course of Y time, if fewer than X UPDN edges are detected, then an insufficient number of UPDN edges are detected to affirmatively determine that the PLL <b>100</b> has slipped, and the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> transitions its state back to the LOCK WAIT state <b>340</b>. LOCK <b>150</b> continues to be asserted to indicate that the PLL <b>100</b> remains in phase lock. However, if X or more UPDN edges are detected in the Y period of time, then the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> affirmatively determines that the PLL has slipped and the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> transitions its state to the IDLE state <b>310</b> in which LOCK <b>150</b> is deasserted indicating loss of lock (i.e., the PLL has slipped). The values of X and Y may be designed into the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> or may be user-configurable. In one example, X is 16 and Y is 32, meaning that slip is determined if the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> detects 16 or more UPDN edges in 32 cycles of REF CLK <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> also generates QUASI SLIP <b>152</b>. The quasi slip feature of the PLL <b>100</b> may be enabled or disabled by a user (e.g., programming a control register within the PLL <b>100</b>). If enabled, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> asserts QUASI SLIP <b>152</b> responsive to the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> being in the SLIP COUNT state <b>350</b>. That is, while LOCK <b>150</b> is asserted, if even one edge of UPDN <b>135</b> is detected, then QUASI SLIP <b>152</b> is asserted, even though the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> has not yet affirmatively determined that the PLL has slipped. An asserted QUASI SLIP <b>152</b> (with a deasserted LOCK <b>150</b>) indicates that the PLL is still determined to be in phase lock, but that at least one cycle of FB_CLK <b>109</b> is out of phase with respect to REF_CLK <b>101</b> by more than a threshold value that would cause LOCK to be deasserted if X or more UPDN edges out of Y REF_CLK cycles were detected (e.g., the maximum width of the A <b>115</b> pulses that is filtered out by LPF <b>122</b> from being present in B <b>125</b>). Any circuitry that uses CLK_OUT <b>107</b> from the PLL <b>100</b> and that is particularly sensitive to any cycles of CLK_OUT that are substantially out of phase with respect to REF_CLK <b>101</b> can respond to the assertion of QUASI SLIP <b>152</b> in a suitable, application-specific manner.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to detecting slip based on the occurrence of X or more UPDN edges out of Y REF_CLK <b>101</b> cycles, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> can also detect slip based on the occurrence of n*X UPDN edges out of m*Y REF_CLK cycles, where m may be greater than n. The values of m and m may be configurable (e.g., in an externally-accessible configuration register) to tune the sensitivity as per application requirements. In one example, n is 3 and m is 4. As such, the lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> determines slip to have occurred if 3X UPDN edges occurs in 4Y REF_CLK cycles. In the example above, X is 16 and Y is 32, and thus slip is detected if 48 UPDN edges are detected in <b>128</b> REF_CLK cycles. The lock-slip control circuit <b>140</b> determines slip to have occurred if either or both of the following conditions are true: (a) X or more UPDN edges occur out of Y REF_CLK cycles, or (b) n*X (or more) UPDN edges occur out of m*Y REF_CLK cycles.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term &#x201c;couple&#x201d; is used throughout the specification.
