Myelin not only enhances axonal conduction velocity, but also provides protection and trophic support (Wilkins et al., <i>J Neurosci, </i>23(12):4967-4974, 2003). Normal myelination requires a series of well-orchestrated events, including the generation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), migration of the OPCs to specific regions of the brain or spinal cord, and differentiation of the OPCs into oligodendrocytes that elaborate multilamellar sheaths of plasma membrane to myelinate axons in precise relation to their diameter. Aberrations in this process during the perinatal period can result in white matter injury and profound sensorimotor and cognitive disabilities. Multiple factors can disrupt the key developmental mileposts, including hemorrhagic-ischemic injuries (Mifsud et al., <i>CNS Neurosci Ther </i>20:603-612, 2014; Crawford et al., <i>J Comp Pathol </i>149:242-254, 2013; and Volpe et al., <i>Int J Devel Neurosci </i>29:423-440, 2011).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This document is based, at least in part, on elucidation of the role of PAR2 in regulating myelination and demyelination, and the development of methods for targeting PAR2 to increase myelination and locomotor activity in vivo. As demonstrated by the data presented herein, PAR2 is a therapeutic target for increasing myelination in the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS). For example, the methods disclosed herein can be used to prevent perinatal white matter injuries, and provide opportunities to improve both short and long term neurological functional outcomes. Collectively, the data described herein identify PAR2 as an innate suppressor of developmental spinal cord myelination, and of neural stem cell expansion and myelin regeneration in the adult CNS. Thus, PAR2 is identified as a target for therapies aimed at promoting myelinogenesis, myelin preservation, and myelin regeneration in neurological conditions that can affect the developing and/or developed (e.g., adult) CNS in which white matter injury and repair is a central concern.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, this document features a method for increasing myelination or remyelination in a mammal.

Demyelinating disease in the CNS causes deterioration of the myelin sheaths that cover nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, preventing the nerves from properly transmitting impulses. Demyelination also can occur in the peripheral nerves.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">CNS demyelinating diseases include, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common demyelinating disease of the CNS. A number of demyelinating diseases, such as optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, affect the optic nerve. Other CNS demyelinating diseases include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Tay-Sachs disease, adrenoleuko-dystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, and transverse myelitis. Demyelination also can be caused by autoimmune disease, infection, nutritional deficiencies, and low oxygen levels.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The symptoms of CNS demyelinating diseases can affect any part of the CNS, and may include seizures, headaches, delirium, confusion, and/or slurred speech. In some cases, muscle weakness, paralysis, trouble with balance, difficulty walking, tremors, pain, numbness, tingling affect some with the disease, vision and hearing problems, and/or bladder problems can occur. Demyelination disorders tend to progress over time, and some forms of CNS demyelination can lead to early death or disability. For example, while people with MS often have a normal or near-normal life expectancy, hereditary demyelination disorders such Tay-Sachs disease can end in early death.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">PAR2 [also referred to as coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor-like 1 (F2RL1) or G-protein coupled receptor 11 (GPR11)] is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the F2RL1 gene. PAR2 modulates inflammatory responses and acts as a sensor for proteolytic enzymes generated during infection (Lee et al., <i>Yonsei Med J </i>51(6):808-822, 2010). PAR2 is a member of the protease-activated receptor family, and also is a member of a large family of 7-transmembrane receptors that couple to guanosine-nucleotide-binding proteins. PAR2 is activated by trypsin (but, unlike PAR1, not by thrombin), by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular N-terminal domain. The new amino terminus resulting from cleavage functions as a tethered ligand, and activates the receptor. PAR2 also can be activated non-proteolytically by exogenous peptide sequences that mimic the final amino acids of the tethered ligand. PAR2 is positioned to serve as a key translator of the proteolytic microenvironment in the developing, adult and injured central nervous system into cellular responses that regulate myelin homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Oligodendrocytes are essential regulators of energy homeostasis, and produce the myelin that insulates neural axons, thereby facilitating electrical conduction in the developing and adult central nervous system. Oligodendrocytes therefore are a target for the design of therapies to promote recovery of function in cases of injury and disease.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described in the Examples herein, a murine genetic model was used to functionally evaluate the role of PAR2 in the process of murine spinal cord myelination at cellular, molecular, and ultrastructural levels. The experimental results demonstrated that PAR2 is a suppressor of developmental myelination, and that its absence results in increased expression of PLP and Olig2, increased ERK1/2 signaling, and increased oligodendrocyte numbers in the perinatal spinal cord, enhanced expression of myelin proteins in differentiated oligodendroglia in vitro, and higher levels of MBP, thicker myelin sheaths, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes and neural stem cells, and enhanced motor activity in adulthood. The experiments described herein also showed that loss of PAR2 can improve myelin integrity after spinal cord injury, and can facilitate myelin regeneration in the adult spinal cord.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This document therefore provides materials and methods for modulating myelination and enhancing oligodendrocyte and neural stem cell numbers in a subject, by delivering to the subject an agent that reduces the activity of PAR2. The subject can be, for example, a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, monkey, or human, including preterm infants as well as juveniles or adults who are in need of increased myelination. Since PAR2 acts to suppress myelination, reducing PAR2 activity can increase myelination. In some embodiments, therefore, a subject identified as having or as being at risk for having a CNS demyelinating disorder can be given an agent that reduces the level of PAR2 activity. In some cases, an agent can inhibit the action of the PAR2 protein, while in other cases an agent can inhibit expression of the PAR2 gene.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Suitable agents include, for example, small molecules, antibodies or antibody fragments, such as Fab&#x2032; fragments, F(ab&#x2032;) 2 fragments, or scFv fragments that bind PAR2, antisense oligonucleotides, interfering RNA (RNAi, including short interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Useful small molecule inhibitors of PAR2 may include, for example, Pepducins such as P2pal-18S (Sevigney et al., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>108:8491-8496, 2011; and Yoon et al., <i>J Neurochem </i>127:283-298, 2013); small molecule inhibitors such as GB88 (Lohman et al., <i>FASEB J</i>26(7):2877-2887, 2012; Lohman et al., <i>Pharmacol Exp Ther </i>340:256-265, 2012; and Suen et al., <i>Brit J Pharmacol </i>171:4112-4124, 2012); neutralizing antibodies (Mandal et al., <i>Blood </i>110:161-170, 2007), and siRNA approaches.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Methods for producing antibodies and antibody fragments are known in the art. Chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies made from non-human (e.g., mouse, rat, gerbil, or hamster) antibodies also can be useful. Chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example, using methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,567; 5,482,856; 5,565,332; 6,054,297; and 6,808,901.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Antisense oligonucleotides as provided herein are at least 8 nucleotides in length and hybridize to a PAR2 transcript. For example, a nucleic acid can be about 8, 9, 10 to 20 (e.g., 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 nucleotides in length), 15 to 20, 18 to 25, or 20 to 50 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, antisense molecules greater than 50 nucleotides in length can be used, including the full-length sequence of a PAR2 mRNA. As used herein, the term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or analogs thereof. Nucleic acid analogs can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone to improve, for example, stability, hybridization, or solubility of a nucleic acid. Modifications at the base moiety include substitution of deoxyuridine for deoxythymidine, and 5-methyl-2&#x2032;-deoxycytidine and 5-bromo-2&#x2032;-deoxycytidine for deoxycytidine. Other examples of nucleobases that can be substituted for a natural base include 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine. Other useful nucleobases include those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Modifications of the sugar moiety can include modification of the 2&#x2032; hydroxyl of the ribose sugar to form 2&#x2032;-O-methyl or 2&#x2032;-O-allyl sugars. The deoxyribose phosphate backbone can be modified to produce morpholino nucleic acids, in which each base moiety is linked to a six-membered, morpholino ring, or peptide nucleic acids, in which the deoxyphosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone (e.g., an aminoethylglycine backbone) and the four bases are retained. See, for example, Summerton and Weller, <i>Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. </i>7:187-195, 1997; and Hyrup et al., <i>Bioorgan. Med. Chem. </i>4:5-23, 1996. In addition, the deoxyphosphate backbone can be replaced with, for example, a phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate backbone, a phosphoroamidite, or an alkyl phosphotriester backbone. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,469,863; 5,235,033; 5,750,666; and 5,596,086 for methods of preparing oligonucleotides with modified backbones.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Antisense oligonucleotides also can be modified by chemical linkage to one or more moieties or conjugates that enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid moieties (e.g., a cholesterol moiety); cholic acid; a thioether moiety (e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol); a thiocholesterol moiety; an aliphatic chain (e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues); a phospholipid moiety (e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethyl-ammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate); a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain; adamantane acetic acid; a palmityl moiety; or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety. The preparation of such oligonucleotide conjugates is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,218,105 and 5,214,136.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Methods for synthesizing antisense oligonucleotides are known, including solid phase synthesis techniques. Equipment for such synthesis is commercially available from several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, expression vectors that contain a regulatory element that directs production of an anti sense transcript can be used to produce antisense molecules.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Antisense oligonucleotides can bind to a nucleic acid encoding PAR2, including DNA encoding PAR2 RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA, under physiological conditions (i.e., physiological pH and ionic strength).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be hybridizable under physiological conditions. Antisense oligonucleotides hybridize under physiological conditions when binding of the oligonucleotide to the PAR2 nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the PAR2 nucleic acid, and non-specific binding to non-target sequences is minimal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Target sites for PAR2 antisense oligonucleotides can include the regions encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene. In addition, the ORF can be targeted effectively in antisense technology, as have the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; untranslated regions. In some embodiments, antisense oligonucleotides can be directed at intron regions and intron-exon junction regions. Further criteria can be applied to the design of antisense oligonucleotides. Such criteria are well known in the art, and are widely used, for example, in the design of oligonucleotide primers. These criteria include the lack of predicted secondary structure of a potential antisense oligonucleotide, an appropriate G and C nucleotide content (e.g., approximately 50%), and the absence of sequence motifs such as single nucleotide repeats (e.g., GGGG runs). The effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotides at modulating expression of a PAR2 nucleic acid can be evaluated by measuring levels of the PAR2 mRNA or polypeptide (e.g., by Northern blotting, RT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA, or immunohistochemical staining).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Single and double-stranded interfering RNA (RNAi, such as siRNA and shRNA) homologous to PAR2 DNA also can be used to reduce expression of PAR2 and consequently, activity of PAR2. Methods for using interfering RNA technology in different species are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6, 933,146; Fire et al., <i>Nature </i>391:806-811, 1998; Romano and Masino, <i>Mol.

For example, each strand can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or nucleic acid analogs. The sense or anti-sense strand also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a target PAR2 sequence (full-length or a fragment) has been subcloned in a sense or anti-sense orientation. The sense and anti-sense RNA strands can be annealed in vitro before delivery of the dsRNA to cells. Alternatively, annealing can occur in vivo after the sense and anti-sense strands are sequentially delivered to the tumor vasculature or to tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">One or more agents that modulate PAR2 levels or activity can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition, such as by combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are biologically compatible vehicles that are suitable for administration to a mammal (e.g., a human), and include, for example, water, physiological saline, and liposomes. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be selected with the planned manner of administration in mind so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, and other pertinent transport and chemical properties, when combined with one or more of components of a given pharmaceutical composition. For example, one or more agents can be formulated for delivery orally or by intravenous infusion, or injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intrathecally, intraperitoneally, intrarectally, intravaginally, intranasally, intragastrically, intratracheally, or intrapulmonarily. In some embodiments, one or more agents can be delivered directly to the CNS by, for example, injection or infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid, optionally with one or more additional agents that are capable of promoting penetration of the first agent across the blood-brain barrier.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The dosage for any one patient required depends on may factors, including the particular agent(s) being administered, time and route of administration, the nature of the formulation, the nature of the patient's illness, the subject's size, weight, surface area, age, and gender, other drugs being administered concurrently, and the judgment of the attending clinician. Suitable dosages typically are in the range of about 10 ng/kg body weight to about 1 g/kg body weight, although wide variations in the needed dosage are to be expected in view of the variety of agents available and the differing efficiencies of various routes of administration. For nucleic acids, dosages may range from about 10<sup>6 </sup>to about 10<sup>12 </sup>copies of the nucleic acid. Further, dosages can be administered on a repeated basis (e.g., on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, such as once a day, every other day, twice weekly, weekly, twice monthly, or monthly). Variations in dosage levels can be adjusted using standard empirical routines for optimization as is well understood in the art. Encapsulation of an agent in a suitable delivery vehicle (e.g., polymeric microparticles or an implantable device) may increase the efficiency of delivery, particularly for oral delivery.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, a nucleic acid (e.g., an expression vector containing a regulatory sequence operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an antisense oligonucleotide, or an expression vector from which sense and anti-sense RNAs can be transcribed under the direction of separate promoters, or a single RNA molecule containing both sense and anti-sense sequences can be transcribed under the direction of a single promoter) can be delivered to appropriate cells in a subject. Suitable expression vectors include, for example, plasmids and viral vectors such as herpes viruses, retroviruses, vaccinia viruses, attenuated vaccinia viruses, canary pox viruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, among others.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Expression of a nucleic acid can be directed to any cell in the body of the subject. However, it can be particularly useful to direct expression to cells in, or close to, the CNS. Targeted expression can be achieved by, for example, the use of polymeric, biodegradable microparticle or microcapsule delivery devices known in the art and/or tissue or cell-specific antibodies. Alternatively, tissue specific targeting can be achieved by the use of tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory sequences (i.e., tissue specific promoters) which are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Nucleic acids also can be delivered to cells using liposomes, which can be prepared by standard methods. Vectors can be incorporated alone into these delivery vehicles, or can be co-incorporated with tissue-specific antibodies. Alternatively, a molecular conjugate composed of a plasmid or other vector attached to poly-L-lysine by electrostatic or covalent forces can be prepared. Poly-L-lysine binds to a ligand that can bind to a receptor on target cells (Cristiano et al., <i>J. Mol. Med. </i>73:479, 1995). Delivery of &#x201c;naked DNA&#x201d; (i.e., without a delivery vehicle) to an intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous site is another means to achieve in vivo expression.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, a method can be an ex vivo procedure that involves providing a recombinant cell that is, or is a progeny of a cell, obtained from a subject and has been transfected or transformed ex vivo with one or more nucleic acids encoding one or more agents that reduce PAR2 activity (e.g., an siRNA targeted to PAR2), so that the cell expresses the agent(s); and administering the cell to the subject. The cells can be cells obtained from the subject to whom they are to be administered, or from another subject. The donor and recipient of the cells can have identical major histocompatibility complex (MHC; HLA in humans) haplotypes. In some embodiments, the donor and recipient are homozygotic twins or are the same individual (i.e., are autologous). The recombinant cells can also be administered to recipients that have no, or only one, two, three, or four MHC molecules in common with the recombinant cells, e.g., in situations where the recipient is severely immuno-compromised, where only mismatched cells are available, and/or where only short term survival of the recombinant cells is required or desirable.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The efficacy of an agent can be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Briefly, an agent can be tested and/or used for its ability to, for example, (a) reduce PAR2 activity, (b) increase myelination, (c) inhibit or slow the progression of demyelination, or (d) promote differentiation of OPCs or generation of oligodendrocytes. For in vivo methods, the agent can, for example, be injected into an animal (e.g., a mouse model of CNS demyelination), and its effects then can be assessed. Suitable methods for evaluating the level or progression of myelination/demyelination include, without limitation, imaging, motor evoked potential, visual evoked potentials, sensorimotor, and cognitive functional outcomes. Based on the results, an appropriate dosage range and administration route can be determined. For in vitro or ex vivo methods, a population of cells (e.g., OPCs) can be contacted with the agent.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">This document provides methods for increasing myelination or remyelination in a subject, promoting myelin protection or preservation in a subject, promoting generation of oligodendrocytes or differentiation of OPCs in a subject, promoting expansion of neural stem cells in a subject, and/or promoting differentiation of neural stem cells toward myelinating cells in a subject. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein can include identifying a subject as being in need of increased myelination, or in need of increased oligodendrocyte numbers. In some embodiments, the subject can be identified on the basis of, for example, having a disorder characterized by demyelination (e.g., demyelination in the CNS). The subject can be a mammal (e.g., a human, including preterm infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult, or a non-human mammal). In some cases, the subject can be identified as having a neuroinflammatory disease (e.g., MS or AD), ALS, a stroke, or an injury to the CNS (e.g., the spinal cord). Alternatively, a subject can be identified as being in need of increased myelination but not having an inflammatory condition, or not having an inflammatory condition in the CNS.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments of the methods provided herein, one or more agents that reduce PAR2 activity, or a composition containing one or more such agents, can be administered to a subject in an amount effective to treat a CNS demyelinating disorder, to reduce or prevent demyelination, to enhance myelination or remyelination, to promote differentiation of OPCs and generation of oligodendrocytes, to promote expansion of neural stem cells, and/or to promote differentiation of neural stem cells toward myelinating cells.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, an effective amount of a PAR2-modulating agent or a composition containing one or more PAR2-modulating agents can reduce the level or rate of demyelination in a subject by at least 10 percent (e.g., at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10 to 25, 25 to 50, 50 to 75, or 75 to 100 percent) as compared to the level or rate of demyelination in the subject prior to treatment, or as compared to the level or rate of demyelination in an untreated subject. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a PAR2-modulating agent or a composition containing one or more PAR2-modulating agents can increase the level or rate of myelination or remyelination in a subject by at least 10 percent (e.g., at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10 to 25, 25 to 50, 50 to 75, 75 to 100, or more than 100 percent) as compared to the level or rate of remyelination in the subject prior to treatment, or as compared to the level or rate of remyelination in an untreated subject. Further, an effective amount of a PAR2-modulating agent or a composition containing one or more PAR2-modulating agents can increase the number of OPCs, oligodendrocytes, and/or neural stem cells in a subject (or in a biological sample from a subject) by at least 10 percent (e.g., at least 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10 to 25, 25 to 50, 50 to 75, 75 to 100, or more than 100 percent) as compared to the number of OPCs, oligodendrocytes, and/or neural stem cells in an untreated subject.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The therapeutically effective amount of a PAR2-modulating agent can be dependent on the particular agent that is utilized, the subject being treated, the severity and type of the affliction, and the manner of administration. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a PAR2-modulating agent can range from about 0.01 &#x3bc;g per kg body weight to about 1 g per kg body weight (e.g., about 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg, about 1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 5 &#x3bc;g/kg, about 5 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 100 &#x3bc;g/kg, about 100 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 500 &#x3bc;g/kg, about 500 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 1 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, about 100 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, or about 500 mg/kg to about 1 g/kg body weight). The exact dose can be readily determined by those of skill in the art, based on the potency of the specific compound the age, weight, sex and physiological condition of the subject. In addition, single or multiple administrations of a PAR2-modulating agent can be given depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the subject. In some embodiments, the dosage is administered once, but in other embodiments the dosage can be administered periodically (e.g., until a therapeutic result is achieved). Generally, the dose is sufficient to treat or ameliorate symptoms or signs of disease without producing unacceptable toxicity to the subject.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some cases, a method as provided herein can include delivering to a subject a population of stem cells that have been modified to have reduced PAR expression as compared to corresponding wild type neural stem cells. For example, the stem cells can be modified in vitro to contain a mutation in the PAR2 gene, such that PAR2 expression is reduced or even knocked out. Suitable types of stem cells include, without limitation, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, bone marrow derived stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. After delivery to the subject (e.g., a preterm infant, or a juvenile or adult having a CNS injury or demyelinating disorder), the stem cells can differentiate into neuronal cells and, due to their reduced level of PAR2 expression, can facilitate or enhance myelination.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading><heading id="h-0010" level="1">PAR2 Loss-of-Function Accelerates the Expression of PLP and Olig2 in the Perinatal Spinal Cord and Results in Higher MBP Levels in Adulthood</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">To critically evaluate the role of PAR2 loss-of-function in myelin development in vivo, the onset, magnitude, and duration of expression of myelin proteins, including the two major myelin structural proteins, proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP), were directly compared in the spinal cord of PAR2+/+ and PAR2&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice at various stages of development from P0 to P45 (adulthood) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

The mean number of remyelinated axons was increased by 25% at the same time post-lesion in mice with PAR2 loss-of-function, which had a mean of 42,770&#xb1;3209 remyelinated axons (P=0.04, Students t-test; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>C</figref>). These results suggested that inhibition of PAR2 may be a useful target to foster myelin regeneration in the adult spinal cord.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 11</heading><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Using Murine and Human Model Systems to Assess PAR2 as a Therapeutic Target for Promoting Myelin Homeostasis, Protection and Regeneration</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additional studies are conducted to evaluate the regulatory role of PAR2 in myelin development, to determine the regulatory role of PAR2 in myelin repair after toxin induced demyelination, and to determine the regulatory role of PAR2 in myelin repair in CNS inflammatory disease. To assess the role of PAR2 in regulating CNS myelin development, the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation, axon ensheathment, myelin protein production, and myelin thickness is determined in the brain and spinal cord of mice with global PAR2 loss-of-function, with conditional deletion of PAR2 selectively in OPCs, or after administration of a PAR2 small molecule inhibitor. The impact on PAR2 loss-of-function or gain-of-function on myelin development is mechanistically dissected in vitro using murine myelinating cultures and induced pluripotent stem cell- (iPSC-) derived human three-dimensional myelinating brain aggregates.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">To evaluate the activity of PAR2 as an innate suppressor of myelin regeneration, the kinetics and quality of remyelination are determined following lysolecithin injection into the corpus callosum, or into the spinal cord white matter of adult mice with global PAR2 loss-of-function, or with conditional deletion of PAR2 selectively in OPCs. Findings are extended using the Cuprizone model of CNS demyelination and myelin repair, in which myelin loss and functional deficits are more widespread, thus permitting assessment of the impact of genetic or pharmacologic PAR2 loss-of-function on recovery of neurologic function. The impact of targeting PAR2 on myelin regeneration is then mechanistically dissected in vitro using the same murine and human-derived myelinating culture platforms used to study myelination developmentally as described above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">To test the role that PAR2 plays in the failure of remyelination observed in the context of CNS inflammatory conditions such as MS, studies are conducted to critically evaluate whether conditional deletion of PAR2 specifically in OPCs facilitates remyelination in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein- (MOG35-55-) induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The findings are complemented by determination of the spatial and temporal localization of PAR2 expression in demyelinating and remyelinating MS lesions. Collectively, these studies provide disease-relevant insights for understanding the role of PAR2 in demyelinating disease, and for optimizing PAR2 targeting strategies for myelin regeneration in a clinical setting.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">OTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims.
