For example, there has been proposed a single-slope ADC using, as a comparator, a pMOS transistor that has a gate to which a reference signal is input and that is inserted between a vertical signal line and a constant current source (for example, see PTL 1). A potential difference between the reference signal and a pixel signal is applied between the gate and source of the pMOS transistor, and the pMOS transistor is turned on or off depending on the potential difference (gate-source voltage) to output a comparison result from the drain thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">[PTL 1]</li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0103222</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In the related art described above, the pMOS transistor is used as the comparator instead of a differential amplifier circuit to achieve reductions in mounting area and power consumption of the ADC as compared to a case where a differential amplifier circuit is used. However, the ADC described above has a problem in that the dynamic range of a pixel signal is narrower than that in a case where no pMOS transistor is inserted. This problem arises since the pMOS transistor is inserted to the vertical signal line and the amplitude of a pixel signal is reduced by a voltage necessary for driving the pMOS transistor. With an increase in power supply voltage, the amplitude can be increased to expand the dynamic range, but the power consumption is increased undesirably.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">The present technology has been made in view of such a circumstance and has an object to expand the dynamic range of a solid-state imaging element including a comparator.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The present technology has been made to solve the problem described above, and according to a first aspect thereof, there is provided a solid-state imaging element including a pixel circuit configured to generate a pixel signal and output the pixel signal to a vertical signal line, and a comparison transistor having a source connected to a constant current source configured to supply a constant current to the vertical signal line, a gate to which a predetermined reference signal is input, and a drain from which a comparison result between the pixel signal and the reference signal is output.

When the auto-zero switch <b>322</b> is closed, potentials at the gate and drain of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> are the same, so that a potential difference between a threshold voltage of the transistor <b>323</b> and the reference signal RMP is written to the capacitor <b>324</b>. Meanwhile, when the auto-zero switch <b>324</b> is opened, a potential difference between the gate and drain of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> is continuously stored.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">The comparison transistor <b>323</b> compares the pixel signal SIG and the reference signal RMP to each other. As the comparison transistor <b>323</b>, an nMOS (n-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor) transistor is used. The reference signal RMP is input to the gate of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> from the DAC <b>220</b> through the capacitor <b>324</b>. Further, the source and back gate of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> are connected to the constant current source <b>273</b>. With this connection configuration, a potential difference between the pixel signal SIG and the reference signal RMP is applied between the gate and source of the comparison transistor <b>323</b>. The comparison transistor <b>323</b> is turned on or off depending on whether the potential difference (that is, gate-source voltage) is higher than the threshold voltage of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> or not.

The load <b>331</b> is inserted between the power supply voltage VDDpix and the drain of the amplification transistor <b>332</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">The amplification transistor <b>332</b> has a gate to which the first-stage output signal OUT is input. The amplification transistor <b>332</b> has a back gate and a source connected to the constant current source <b>333</b> and the source of the comparison transistor <b>323</b>. The amplification transistor <b>332</b> has a drain from which an amplified signal is output to the counter <b>272</b> as the comparison result signal CMP.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Here, as a comparative example, a configuration in which a pMOS (n-channel MOS) transistor is provided instead of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> (nMOS transistor) is assumed. In the case where the pMOS transistor is used, the pMOS transistor has a source connected to the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>, a drain connected to the constant current source <b>273</b>, and a gate to which the reference signal RMP is input as in the case described above. That is, the pMOS transistor is inserted in series to the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>. Further, as the clamp transistor and the amplification transistor on the second stage, P-type transistors are also used.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In such a comparative example, since the pMOS transistor is inserted in series to the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>, the dynamic range is narrowed by a voltage necessary for operating the pMOS transistor (for example, threshold voltage of 0.2 V+output amplitude of 0.4 V=0.6 V). For example, in a case where the power supply voltage is 2.8 volts (V), a voltage drop due to a voltage necessary for operating the pixel circuit <b>260</b> and the wiring resistance is 1.0 volt (V), and a voltage necessary for operating the constant current source is 0.4 volts (V), when a voltage necessary for operating the pMOS transistor is 0.6 (V), the amplitude of the level of the vertical signal line contributing to the dynamic range is expressed by the following expression.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2.8&#x2212;1.0&#x2212;0.6&#x2212;0.4=0.8 (V) &#x2003;&#x2003;Expression 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">In particular, with regard to the solid-state imaging element <b>200</b> in which an accumulated charge amount Qs of the floating diffusion layer is large such as a large sensor, a wide dynamic range is required, and hence, the effect of a drop in dynamic range due to a pMOS transistor is large.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">In contrast to this, in the comparator <b>300</b> exemplified in the figure, the n-type comparison transistor <b>323</b> is used, and the n-type comparison transistor <b>323</b> has the source connected to the constant current source <b>273</b> and the drain connected to the power supply voltage VDDpix through the load <b>310</b>. With this connection configuration, the comparison transistor <b>323</b> is connected in parallel to the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<b>1</b>. With the comparison transistor <b>323</b> connected in parallel, a drop in dynamic range due to a pMOS transistor inserted in series can be suppressed. For example, in a case where conditions in terms of the power supply voltage and a potential drop due to the wiring resistance of the vertical signal line are the same as those in the case described above and a voltage necessary for operating the constant current source <b>273</b> is 0.4 volts (V) as in the case described above, the amplitude of the level of the vertical signal line contributing to the dynamic range is expressed by the following expression.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2.8&#x2212;1.0&#x2212;0.4=1.4 (V) &#x2003;&#x2003;Expression 2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0101" num="0097">When the right sides of Expression 1 and Expression 2 are compared to each other, the configuration in which the comparison transistor <b>323</b> is connected in parallel can achieve a larger amplitude than the comparative example and therefore expand the dynamic range.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0098">With the clamp transistor <b>325</b>, the amplitude of the first-stage output signal OUT can be kept constant irrespective of the amount of exposure, with the result that the satisfactory linearity characteristics of the comparison result inversion timing with respect to the amount of exposure is achieved. Further, since the current of the comparator <b>300</b> before and after an inversion is the same, inter-column interference through the power supply or the ground can be suppressed, so that streaking and the like due to inter-column interference can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0099">Further, with the capacitor <b>321</b> for bandlimiting provided between the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n </i>and the comparison transistor <b>323</b> on the first stage, the amount of charge or discharge of the capacitor <b>321</b> is not affected by the level of the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>, so that the linearity characteristics can be improved.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0100">Further, since comparison results are output from the drain of the comparison transistor <b>323</b> on the first stage having the source connected to the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>, the level of the reference signal at the time of inversion of the output of the amplification transistor <b>332</b> on the second stage follows the level of the vertical signal line <b>269</b>-<i>n</i>. With this, the linearity can be improved.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0101">Further, the comparison transistor <b>323</b> on the first stage and the amplification transistor <b>332</b> on the second stage can directly be connected to each other by DC coupling.

In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the vehicle control system <b>12000</b> includes a driving system control unit <b>12010</b>, a body system control unit <b>12020</b>, an outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b>, an in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b>, and an integrated control unit <b>12050</b>. In addition, a microcomputer <b>12051</b>, a sound/image output section <b>12052</b>, and a vehicle-mounted network interface (I/F) <b>12053</b> are illustrated as a functional configuration of the integrated control unit <b>12050</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0167">The driving system control unit <b>12010</b> controls the operation of devices related to the driving system of the vehicle in accordance with various kinds of programs. For example, the driving system control unit <b>12010</b> functions as a control device for a driving force generating device for generating the driving force of the vehicle, such as an internal combustion engine, a driving motor, or the like, a driving force transmitting mechanism for transmitting the driving force to wheels, a steering mechanism for adjusting the steering angle of the vehicle, a braking device for generating the braking force of the vehicle, and the like.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0168">The body system control unit <b>12020</b> controls the operation of various kinds of devices provided to a vehicle body in accordance with various kinds of programs. For example, the body system control unit <b>12020</b> functions as a control device for a keyless entry system, a smart key system, a power window device, or various kinds of lamps such as a headlamp, a backup lamp, a brake lamp, a turn signal, a fog lamp, or the like. In this case, radio waves transmitted from a mobile device as an alternative to a key or signals of various kinds of switches can be input to the body system control unit <b>12020</b>. The body system control unit <b>12020</b> receives these input radio waves or signals, and controls a door lock device, the power window device, the lamps, or the like of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0169">The outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> detects information about the outside of the vehicle including the vehicle control system <b>12000</b>. For example, the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> is connected with an imaging section <b>12031</b>. The outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> makes the imaging section <b>12031</b> image an image of the outside of the vehicle, and receives the imaged image. On the basis of the received image, the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> may perform processing of detecting an object such as a human, a vehicle, an obstacle, a sign, a character on a road surface, or the like, or processing of detecting a distance thereto.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0170">The imaging section <b>12031</b> is an optical sensor that receives light, and which outputs an electric signal corresponding to a received light amount of the light. The imaging section <b>12031</b> can output the electric signal as an image, or can output the electric signal as information about a measured distance. In addition, the light received by the imaging section <b>12031</b> may be visible light, or may be invisible light such as infrared rays or the like.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0171">The in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b> detects information about the inside of the vehicle. The in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b> is, for example, connected with a driver state detecting section <b>12041</b> that detects the state of a driver. The driver state detecting section <b>12041</b>, for example, includes a camera that images the driver. On the basis of detection information input from the driver state detecting section <b>12041</b>, the in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b> may calculate a degree of fatigue of the driver or a degree of concentration of the driver, or may determine whether the driver is dozing.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0172">The microcomputer <b>12051</b> can calculate a control target value for the driving force generating device, the steering mechanism, or the braking device on the basis of the information about the inside or outside of the vehicle which information is obtained by the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> or the in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b>, and output a control command to the driving system control unit <b>12010</b>. For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can perform cooperative control intended to implement functions of an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) which functions include collision avoidance or shock mitigation for the vehicle, following driving based on a following distance, vehicle speed maintaining driving, a warning of collision of the vehicle, a warning of deviation of the vehicle from a lane, or the like.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0173">In addition, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can perform cooperative control intended for automatic driving, which makes the vehicle to travel automatedly without depending on the operation of the driver, or the like, by controlling the driving force generating device, the steering mechanism, the braking device, or the like on the basis of the information about the outside or inside of the vehicle which information is obtained by the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b> or the in-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12040</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0174">In addition, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can output a control command to the body system control unit <b>12020</b> on the basis of the information about the outside of the vehicle which information is obtained by the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b>. For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can perform cooperative control intended to prevent a glare by controlling the headlamp so as to change from a high beam to a low beam, for example, in accordance with the position of a preceding vehicle or an oncoming vehicle detected by the outside-vehicle information detecting unit <b>12030</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0175">The sound/image output section <b>12052</b> transmits an output signal of at least one of a sound and an image to an output device capable of visually or auditorily notifying information to an occupant of the vehicle or the outside of the vehicle. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, an audio speaker <b>12061</b>, a display section <b>12062</b>, and an instrument panel <b>12063</b> are illustrated as the output device.

The imaging section <b>12101</b> provided to the front nose and the imaging section <b>12105</b> provided to the upper portion of the windshield within the interior of the vehicle obtain mainly an image of the front of the vehicle <b>12100</b>. The imaging sections <b>12102</b> and <b>12103</b> provided to the sideview mirrors obtain mainly an image of the sides of the vehicle <b>12100</b>. The imaging section <b>12104</b> provided to the rear bumper or the back door obtains mainly an image of the rear of the vehicle <b>12100</b>. The imaging section <b>12105</b> provided to the upper portion of the windshield within the interior of the vehicle is used mainly to detect a preceding vehicle, a pedestrian, an obstacle, a signal, a traffic sign, a lane, or the like.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0179">Incidentally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> depicts an example of photographing ranges of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>. An imaging range <b>12111</b> represents the imaging range of the imaging section <b>12101</b> provided to the front nose. Imaging ranges <b>12112</b> and <b>12113</b> respectively represent the imaging ranges of the imaging sections <b>12102</b> and <b>12103</b> provided to the sideview mirrors. An imaging range <b>12114</b> represents the imaging range of the imaging section <b>12104</b> provided to the rear bumper or the back door. A bird's-eye image of the vehicle <b>12100</b> as viewed from above is obtained by superimposing image data imaged by the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0180">At least one of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> may have a function of obtaining distance information. For example, at least one of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> may be a stereo camera constituted of a plurality of imaging elements, or may be an imaging element having pixels for phase difference detection.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0181">For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can determine a distance to each three-dimensional object within the imaging ranges <b>12111</b> to <b>12114</b> and a temporal change in the distance (relative speed with respect to the vehicle <b>12100</b>) on the basis of the distance information obtained from the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>, and thereby extract, as a preceding vehicle, a nearest three-dimensional object in particular that is present on a traveling path of the vehicle <b>12100</b> and which travels in substantially the same direction as the vehicle <b>12100</b> at a predetermined speed (for example, equal to or more than 0 km/hour). Further, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can set a following distance to be maintained in front of a preceding vehicle in advance, and perform automatic brake control (including following stop control), automatic acceleration control (including following start control), or the like. It is thus possible to perform cooperative control intended for automatic driving that makes the vehicle travel automatedly without depending on the operation of the driver or the like.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0182">For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> can classify three-dimensional object data on three-dimensional objects into three-dimensional object data of a two-wheeled vehicle, a standard-sized vehicle, a large-sized vehicle, a pedestrian, a utility pole, and other three-dimensional objects on the basis of the distance information obtained from the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>, extract the classified three-dimensional object data, and use the extracted three-dimensional object data for automatic avoidance of an obstacle. For example, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> identifies obstacles around the vehicle <b>12100</b> as obstacles that the driver of the vehicle <b>12100</b> can recognize visually and obstacles that are difficult for the driver of the vehicle <b>12100</b> to recognize visually. Then, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> determines a collision risk indicating a risk of collision with each obstacle. In a situation in which the collision risk is equal to or higher than a set value and there is thus a possibility of collision, the microcomputer <b>12051</b> outputs a warning to the driver via the audio speaker <b>12061</b> or the display section <b>12062</b>, and performs forced deceleration or avoidance steering via the driving system control unit <b>12010</b>. The microcomputer <b>12051</b> can thereby assist in driving to avoid collision.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0183">At least one of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> may be an infrared camera that detects infrared rays. The microcomputer <b>12051</b> can, for example, recognize a pedestrian by determining whether or not there is a pedestrian in imaged images of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>. Such recognition of a pedestrian is, for example, performed by a procedure of extracting characteristic points in the imaged images of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b> as infrared cameras and a procedure of determining whether or not it is the pedestrian by performing pattern matching processing on a series of characteristic points representing the contour of the object. When the microcomputer <b>12051</b> determines that there is a pedestrian in the imaged images of the imaging sections <b>12101</b> to <b>12104</b>, and thus recognizes the pedestrian, the sound/image output section <b>12052</b> controls the display section <b>12062</b> so that a square contour line for emphasis is displayed so as to be superimposed on the recognized pedestrian. The sound/image output section <b>12052</b> may also control the display section <b>12062</b> so that an icon or the like representing the pedestrian is displayed at a desired position.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0184">An example of the vehicle control system to which the technology according to the present disclosure is applicable has been described above.
