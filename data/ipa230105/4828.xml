Forged components are used, for example, in the automotive industry, the aviation industry, the farm equipment industry, the manufacturing industry (for machines that manufacture items), the construction industry (for machines that assist in construction), etc. Forging of components is a complicated and involved process, requiring specialized knowledge to produce components having high degrees of strength (e.g., tensile strength), heat resistance, and other properties compared to equivalent components produced via casting or machining.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain instances, such as hot forging, the forged component may undergo an additional quenching process in which the hot forged component is placed in a medium to facilitate cooling (or in other words heat transfer from the hot forged component to the medium). Examples of mediums may include water, oil, and air. Quenching may, for components forged from metals such as iron and steel, increase the hardness of the forged component relative to forged components that do not undergo quenching. Quenching, like forging, is a complicated and involved process that varies depending on a number of different factors (or in other words, quenching parameters), such as a size of a quenching tank, an extent of agitation, the medium used for quenching, how the quenching medium is delivered, and how the forged component is delivered into the quenching tank. Incorrect quenching may introduce distortions (e.g., cracks, warping, inconsistent hardness, etc.) that may reduce the strength and/or change the geometry of the forged product, which may potentially render the forged product unsuitable for use in production.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rather than resort to trial and error, forges and/or forge customers may model heat transfer using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to better understand how quenching will impact the hot forged component. CFD relies on partial differential equations (PDEs) to solve a mathematical model of how the fluid dynamics may facilitate transfer of heat from the hot forged component to the quenching medium (which may also be referred to as the &#x201c;quenchant&#x201d;). A mechanical finite element method (FEM) model may utilize the output of the CFD model to produce data representative of location-specific quench impacts on the hot forged component.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While modeling may reduce application of quenching that results in unsuitable forged components, such modeling may be time consuming, especially when there are a number of different potential geometries for a given forged product, each of which must be separately modeled. In addition, each forge may have different quenching configurations that very greatly between one another, which may result in each forge and/or customer having to repeat such modeling for each quenching configuration.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various aspects of the techniques described in this disclosure may enable computing devices to leverage machine learning to predict how a quenching process performed according to various quenching parameters may impact a hot forged component. The computing device may obtain a trained machine learning model that has been trained using model results output from past quench modeling of forged components having a variety of different geometries. The trained machine learning model may associate the model results to the underlying different geometries of each of the forged components. In some instances, the association learned by the trained machine learning model may involve a mapping of heat transfer coefficients to features (which may be extracted via a principal component analysis or by way of a convolutional neural network) representative of the underlying different geometries of each of the forged components.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The computing device may then obtain data representative of a target forged component design having a target geometry that differs from the geometries of the forged components used to train the machine learning model. The computing device may extract the features of the geometry of the target forged component, providing the extracted features of the target geometry for the target forged component as an input to the trained machine learning model. The trained machine learning model may, upon receiving the extracted features of the target geometry for the target forged component, identify one or more of the training forged components having a similar (e.g., a sum of differences between the extracted features for the target forged component and the extracted features for the training forged components within a set threshold) geometry or partial geometry. The trained machine learning model may then assign model results for the similar geometries (or partial geometries) for the training forged components to the target geometry (or partial target geometry) for the target forged component, thereby potentially avoiding the need to perform extensive modeling for the target forged component.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this way, various aspects of the techniques may facilitate more efficient operation of the computing device itself. By allowing the computing device to predict model results through application of a trained machine learning model, the computing device may consume less resources (e.g., processor cycles, memory, memory bus bandwidth, and accompanying power) compared to performing a full modeling (involving computational fluid dynamics and mechanical finite element method processes) with respect to each variation of the geometry of the forged component.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, as full modeling may consume significant amounts of time, the computing device that processes target geometries for forged components using trained machine learning models may rapidly prototype different geometries and possibly identify geometries that would perform better than accepted existing geometries, leading to development of better geometries for forged components. The computing device may also identify potential geometries for forged components that should also undergo further full modeling, which may then be used to train the trained machine learning model to further improve prediction. In addition, the computing device may utilize the trained machine learning model to identify divergence in quenching processes between suppliers allowing for transfer of forged components between supplies that will result in forged components having quench distortion within required tolerances, thereby facilitating selection of suppliers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, various aspects of the techniques are directed to a computing device comprising: a memory configured to: store a trained machine learning model that associates training features extracted from data representative of a plurality of training forged components having a respective different geometry of a plurality of geometries to a plurality of training model results representative of one or more mechanical properties generated through modeling application of a quench process to the plurality of training forged components according to quench parameters;

and output the predicted model results.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another example, various aspects of the techniques are directed to a method comprising: performing a geometrical analysis with respect to data representative of a target forged component to extract target features;
