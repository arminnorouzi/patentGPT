However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, embodiments of the disclosure include systems and methods for determining a well intervention plan using machine learning (ML). In some embodiments, for example, a well intervention operation may include various logistical considerations based on issues such as service providers and material availability, nearby activities in surrounding wells, tool availability, weather conditions, safety concerns, etc., as well as various service provider considerations (e.g., local contract conditions, the scope of the sub-tasks within the contracts, operational aspects, involved parties, interdepartmental interactions, etc.). As such, human site planning may be a tedious process that is difficult to re-schedule based on changing well scenarios. Likewise, human planners may miss important scheduling criteria for avoiding conflicts and human errors. Accordingly, some embodiments include a well intervention manager that may be a &#x201c;smart system&#x201d; or &#x201c;expert system&#x201d; that automatically plans, synchronizes, and/or readjusts scheduling criteria for a well intervention plan for one or more well intervention operations. In other words, a well intervention manager may be an artificial intelligence entity operation on a well management network (e.g., as a network controller) that performs such functionality.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, some embodiments include a well intervention manager with self-decision functionality that operates independently and with flexibility. For example, the well intervention manager may perform a learning process that detects unusual items not involved for planning purposes. For example, a well intervention manager may determine statistical trends based on well data (such as maintenance and service log data), resource data, and/or service provider data. Likewise, a well intervention manager may determine one or more additional values or weights for arranging the setup of well sites schedules. This flexibility may accommodate changes in real time and on the fly observed matters, like safety concerns, alternate logistics interactions (other service entities and scheduling criteria, like government factors, weather factors, safety factors, legal factors, etc.) which builds trends and improve robustness of various well intervention plans by advising about possible issues. These different factors may provide the data inputs that are adjusted over time to optimize a particular scheduling criterion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, some embodiments use one or more machine learning algorithms to determine which data inputs to use for a scheduling criterion. For example, different sets of data inputs may maximize operational efficiency and hydrocarbon production at one or more wells, while also minimizing operational costs for those same wells. For example, an optimized set of data inputs may be a subset of larger aggregated set of data inputs identified over a well management network. These aggregated data inputs may be recognized by a well intervention manager, where the well intervention manager proscribes different weights or significances to various data inputs. Thus, a well intervention manager may provide a flexible method to accommodate multiple scheduling criteria (e.g., swapping importance/relevance of different data inputs that corresponds to various incidents, costs, contracts, performances, etc.) in real-time to re-arrange different well intervention plans. Thus, a well intervention manager may automatically readjust variables for a well intervention plan based on predicting their future importance to a user. In some embodiments, a well intervention plan may be updated based on real-time observed matters during actual performance of the well intervention plan (e.g., in response to changing safety concerns, alternate logistics interaction, contract terms, conditions, scope, cost and resources related to implementation of the plan, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a drilling system (<b>100</b>) that may include a top drive drill rig (<b>110</b>) arranged around the setup of a drill bit logging tool (<b>120</b>). A top drive drill rig (<b>110</b>) may include a top drive (<b>111</b>) that may be suspended in a derrick (<b>112</b>) by a travelling block (<b>113</b>). In the center of the top drive (<b>111</b>), a drive shaft (<b>114</b>) may be coupled to a top pipe of a drill string (<b>115</b>), for example, by threads. The top drive (<b>111</b>) may rotate the drive shaft (<b>114</b>), so that the drill string (<b>115</b>) and a drill bit logging tool (<b>120</b>) cut the rock at the bottom of a wellbore (<b>116</b>). A power cable (<b>117</b>) supplying electric power to the top drive (<b>111</b>) may be protected inside one or more service loops (<b>118</b>) coupled to a control system (<b>144</b>). As such, drilling mud may be pumped into the wellbore (<b>116</b>) through a mud line, the drive shaft (<b>114</b>), and/or the drill string (<b>115</b>).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The control system (<b>144</b>) may include one or more programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that include hardware and/or software with functionality to control one or more processes performed by the drilling system (<b>100</b>). Specifically, a programmable logic controller may control valve states, fluid levels, pipe pressures, warning alarms, and/or pressure releases throughout a drilling rig. In particular, a programmable logic controller may be a ruggedized computer system with functionality to withstand vibrations, extreme temperatures, wet conditions, and/or dusty conditions, for example, around a drilling rig. Without loss of generality, the term &#x201c;control system&#x201d; may refer to a drilling operation control system that is used to operate and control the equipment, a drilling data acquisition and monitoring system that is used to acquire drilling process and equipment data and to monitor the operation of the drilling process, or a drilling interpretation software system that is used to analyze and understand drilling events and progress. For example, the control system (<b>144</b>) may be coupled to the sensor assembly (<b>123</b>) in order to perform various program functions for up-down steering and left-right steering of the drill bit (<b>124</b>) through the wellbore (<b>116</b>). While one control system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drilling system (<b>100</b>) may include multiple control systems for managing various well drilling operations, maintenance operations, well completion operations, and/or well intervention operations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The wellbore (<b>116</b>) may include a bored hole that extends from the surface into a target zone of the hydrocarbon-bearing formation, such as the reservoir. An upper end of the wellbore (<b>116</b>), terminating at or near the surface, may be referred to as the &#x201c;up-hole&#x201d; end of the wellbore (<b>116</b>), and a lower end of the wellbore, terminating in the hydrocarbon-bearing formation, may be referred to as the &#x201c;down-hole&#x201d; end of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). The wellbore (<b>116</b>) may facilitate the circulation of drilling fluids during well drilling operations, the flow of hydrocarbon production (&#x201c;production&#x201d;) (e.g., oil and gas) from the reservoir to the surface during production operations, the injection of substances (e.g., water) into the hydrocarbon-bearing formation or the reservoir during injection operations, or the communication of monitoring devices (e.g., logging tools) into the hydrocarbon-bearing formation or the reservoir during monitoring operations (e.g., during in situ logging operations).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, sensors (<b>121</b>) may be included in a sensor assembly (<b>123</b>), which is positioned adjacent to a drill bit (<b>124</b>) and coupled to the drill string (<b>115</b>). Sensors (<b>121</b>) may also be coupled to a processor assembly (<b>123</b>) that includes a processor, memory, and an analog-to-digital converter (<b>122</b>) for processing sensor measurements. For example, the sensors (<b>121</b>) may include acoustic sensors, such as accelerometers, measurement microphones, contact microphones, and hydrophones. Likewise, the sensors (<b>121</b>) may include other types of sensors, such as transmitters and receivers to measure resistivity, gamma ray detectors, etc. The sensors (<b>121</b>) may include hardware and/or software for generating different types of well logs (such as acoustic logs or sonic longs) that may provide well data about a wellbore, including porosity of wellbore sections, gas saturation, bed boundaries in a geologic formation, fractures in the wellbore or completion cement, and many other pieces of information about a formation. If such well data is acquired during well drilling operations (i.e., logging-while-drilling), then the information may be used to make adjustments to drilling operations in real-time. Such adjustments may include rate of penetration (ROP), drilling direction, altering mud weight, and many others drilling parameters.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, acoustic sensors may be installed in a drilling fluid circulation system of a drilling system (<b>100</b>) to record acoustic drilling signals in real-time. Drilling acoustic signals may transmit through the drilling fluid to be recorded by the acoustic sensors located in the drilling fluid circulation system. The recorded drilling acoustic signals may be processed and analyzed to determine well data, such as lithological and petrophysical properties of the rock formation. This well data may be used in various applications, such as steering a drill bit using geosteering, casing shoe positioning, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Keeping with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when completing a well, one or more well completion operations may be performed prior to delivering the well to the party responsible for production or injection. Well completion operations may include casing operations, cementing operations, perforating the well, gravel packing, directional drilling, hydraulic and acid stimulation of a reservoir region, and/or installing a production tree or wellhead assembly at the wellbore (<b>116</b>). Likewise, well operations may include open-hole completions or cased-hole completions. For example, an open-hole completion may refer to a well that is drilled to the top of the hydrocarbon reservoir. Thus, the well is cased at the top of the reservoir, and left open at the bottom of a wellbore. In contrast, cased-hole completions may include running casing into a reservoir region. Cased-hole completions are discussed further below with respect to perforation operations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one well delivery example, the sides of the wellbore (<b>116</b>) may require support, and thus casing may be inserted into the wellbore (<b>116</b>) to provide such support. After a well has been drilled, casing may ensure that the wellbore (<b>116</b>) does not close in upon itself, while also protecting the wellstream from outside incumbents, like water or sand. Likewise, if the formation is firm, casing may include a solid string of steel pipe that is run on the well and will remain that way during the life of the well. In some embodiments, the casing includes a wire screen liner that blocks loose sand from entering the wellbore (<b>116</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another well delivery example, a space between the casing and the untreated sides of the wellbore (<b>116</b>) may be cemented to hold a casing in place. This well operation may include pumping cement slurry into the wellbore (<b>116</b>) to displace existing drilling fluid and fill in this space between the casing and the untreated sides of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). Cement slurry may include a mixture of various additives and cement. After the cement slurry is left to harden, cement may seal the wellbore (<b>116</b>) from non-hydrocarbons that attempt to enter the wellstream. In some embodiments, the cement slurry is forced through a lower end of the casing and into an annulus between the casing and a wall of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). More specifically, a cementing plug may be used for pushing the cement slurry from the casing. For example, the cementing plug may be a rubber plug used to separate cement slurry from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. A displacement fluid, such as water, or an appropriately weighted drilling fluid, may be pumped into the casing above the cementing plug. This displacement fluid may be pressurized fluid that serves to urge the cementing plug downward through the casing to extrude the cement from the casing outlet and back up into the annulus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Keeping with well operations, some embodiments include perforation operations. More specifically, a perforation operation may include perforating casing and cement at different locations in the wellbore (<b>116</b>) to enable hydrocarbons to enter a wellstream from the resulting holes. For example, some perforation operations include using a perforation gun at different reservoir levels to produce holed sections through the casing, cement, and sides of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). Hydrocarbons may then enter the wellstream through these holed sections. In some embodiments, perforation operations are performed using discharging jets or shaped explosive charges to penetrate the casing around the wellbore (<b>116</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another well delivery, a filtration system may be installed in the wellbore (<b>116</b>) in order to prevent sand and other debris from entering the wellstream. For example, a gravel packing operation may be performed using a gravel-packing slurry of appropriately sized pieces of coarse sand or gravel. As such, the gravel-packing slurry may be pumped into the wellbore (<b>116</b>) between a casing's slotted liner and the sides of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). The slotted liner and the gravel pack may filter sand and other debris that might have otherwise entered the wellstream with hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another well delivery, a wellhead assembly may be installed on the wellhead of the wellbore (<b>116</b>). A wellhead assembly may be a production tree (also called a Christmas tree) that includes valves, gauges, and other components to provide surface control of subsurface conditions of a well.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) is coupled to one or more control systems (e.g., control system (<b>144</b>)) at a wellsite. For example, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may include hardware and/or software to collect well operation data (e.g., well operation data (<b>150</b>)) from one or more well sites. Likewise, the well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may monitor various well operations performed by various service entities. In some embodiments, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) is a controller located on a server remote from the well site. In some embodiments, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may be similar to a control system coupled to the drilling system (<b>100</b>). In some embodiments, the well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may include a computer system that is similar to the computer system (<b>602</b>) described below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, well intervention operations may include various operations carried out by one or more service entities for an oil or gas well during its productive life (e.g., fracking operations, CT, flow back, separator, pumping, wellhead and Christmas tree maintenance, slickline, wireline, well maintenance, stimulation, braded line, coiled tubing, snubbing, workover, subsea well intervention, etc.). For example, well intervention activities may be similar to well completion operations, well delivery operations, and/or drilling operations in order to modify the state of a well or well geometry. In some embodiments, well intervention operations provide well diagnostics, and/or manage the production of the well. With respect to service entities, a service entity may be a company or other actor that performs one or more types of oil field services, such as well operations, at a well site. For example, one or more service entities may be responsible for performing a cementing operation in the wellbore (<b>116</b>) prior to delivering the well to a producing entity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Moreover, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may include functionality for coordinating various oilfield services, such as well intervention using various commands (e.g., command (<b>155</b>)), e.g., by transmitting commands to various network devices (e.g., control system (<b>144</b>)) in a drilling system as well as various user devices at the well site. In some embodiments, for example, a command is a network message that automatically assigns or reassigns tasks or operations to various service entities at a well site. For example, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may communicate with one or more service entities through various user devices, e.g., by receiving periodic status reports, sending messages through user interfaces, etc. Likewise, the well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may also collect other well operation data, such as sensor data from the drilling system (<b>100</b>), service provider data, resource data (including rig and rigless site daily reports), feedback through a human machine interface from other personnel at the well site, and/or data from a historian operating at the well site. The well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) may be a computer system similar to computer system (<b>602</b>) described below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) includes one or more ML models (e.g., ML models X (<b>265</b>)) for determining a well intervention plan using data inputs. For example, a scheduling criterion may correspond to a specific set of data inputs that may be adjusted (e.g., data inputs added and/or removed) to modify the well intervention plan. For example, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may assist a well intervention manager in linking contributions of different service entities to a well delivery process (i.e., a well delivery process that includes one or more well operations) to evaluate efficiency and service quality. In some embodiments, for example, a well intervention manager (<b>160</b>) uses a ML model (<b>265</b>) to determine a well intervention plan for measuring a service entity's contribution to a particular well intervention. For more information regarding well intervention planning, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> below and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a well management network (e.g., well management network A (<b>200</b>)) may include a well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)), various oil and gas wells (e.g., well A (<b>210</b>), well B (<b>220</b>)), various servers (e.g., service provider server N (<b>270</b>)), and various user devices (e.g., user device M (<b>230</b>)), various inventory servers (e.g., inventory server C (<b>250</b>)), and/or various network elements (not shown). A well (e.g., well A (<b>210</b>), well B (<b>220</b>)) may include a well system (e.g., well system A (<b>212</b>), well system B (<b>222</b>)) that is similar to well system (<b>100</b>) described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the accompanying description. In some embodiments, various types of well data (e.g., well data A (<b>291</b>)) are collected over the well management network, such as well condition data (e.g., well condition data A (<b>211</b>)), safety alert data (e.g., safety alert data A (<b>213</b>)), well progress data (e.g., well progress data A (<b>214</b>)), and/or well activity data (e.g., well activity data A (<b>215</b>)). Likewise, the well management network may also collect data regarding other well activities data (e.g., user data (<b>233</b>), resource data (<b>292</b>), service provider data (<b>294</b>)) from one or more user device and/or data servers (e.g., user device M (<b>230</b>), inventory server C (<b>250</b>), well service provider servicer N (<b>270</b>)). For example, safety data may be associated with safety alerts. Well condition data may describe various conditions at one or more wells, such as corresponding to safety conditions, weather conditions, well conditions, etc. Resource data may include information describing material availability, tools availability. Service provider data may include logistical data regarding different service providers, such as information regarding contract timing expiration, service provider availability, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, an inventory server may be a remote server that includes hardware and/or software with functionality for managing and/or tracking equipment. For example, an inventory server may maintain resource data on drilling tools and various well intervention tools based on the location of a respective tool for a particular time period. Likewise, a remote server may be a server that communicates to various well sites over the Internet or through a cloud computing environment. When tools are committed to various well operations, the current or future operation with the respective tool may be logged automatically with the inventory server (e.g., by detecting a scan of the tool's unique identifier). Accordingly, an inventory server may transmit resource data (e.g., updates to changes in a respective tool's availability for a particular well site) to a well intervention manager.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, a service provider server is a remote server that includes hardware and/or software for managing and tracking service provider data. For example, the service provider server may obtain contract data regarding various service entities and their commitments to current and/or future well operation contracts. Accordingly, a service provider server may transmit service provider data (e.g., updates to changes in possible service entity conflicts for a given well operation) to a well intervention manager.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) may include hardware and/or software that obtain a scheduling criterion (e.g., scheduling criteria X (<b>261</b>)) regarding well intervention activities, well data (e.g., well data X (<b>263</b>)), resource data (e.g., resource data X (<b>266</b>)), and/or service provider data (e.g., service provider data X (<b>267</b>)) from data inputs (e.g., user data (<b>233</b>), well data A (<b>291</b>), resource data (<b>292</b>), service provider data (<b>294</b>)). For example, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) acquires the scheduling criterion (e.g., scheduling criteria X (<b>261</b>)) from a user data (<b>233</b>) collected by a user device (e.g., user device M (<b>230</b>)). The user device (e.g., user device M (<b>230</b>)) may include hardware and/or software to receive real-time user selections (e.g., user selections N (<b>231</b>)) by interacting with a user via a user interface (e.g., user interface O (<b>232</b>)). Specifically, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) allows the user to interact with the user device (e.g., user device M (<b>230</b>)) to verify the actual well intervention plan setup is as per desire and monitor the performance as the self-learning process of the ML algorithm is set up for retro alimentation up on the actual events. When the well intervention plan setup is not desired, the user can modify the user selections (e.g., user selections N (<b>231</b>)) to adjust the scheduling criterion via the graphical display (e.g., user interface O (<b>232</b>)).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Keeping with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) may include hardware and/or software to generate one or more well intervention plans within the well management network (e.g., well management network A (<b>200</b>)) using one or more ML algorithms (e.g., ML algorithms X (<b>264</b>)) based on the obtained scheduling criterion and well intervention activities. For example, a well intervention manager may implement machine learning by gathering data from actual well progress data (e.g., status updates at a well site regarding one or more well operations) and real events to tune a particular scheduling criterion and/or logical margins regarding flexibility for a well site's year, monthly, weekly plans. Thus, different inputs (e.g., types of data or different data sources) may provide the initial setup of a particular scheduling criterion, where the data inputs may be customized according to different well scenarios to better arrange a forward schedule as a well intervention plan. Since the well intervention manager is self-maintained on data storage and usage for retro alimentation, the well intervention manager may require minimal supervision of human interaction. In some embodiments, the well intervention manager advises a user about a plan's regular structure of setting a well intervention plan when the learning process detects possible related concerns that a human might miss due to the amount of variables and possible related issues. For example, an advisement may be a message prompt in a graphical user interface managed by the well intervention manager.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, for example, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) applies one or more ML algorithms (e.g., an unsupervised ML algorithm, a reinforcement ML algorithm, a self-supervised ML algorithm, etc.) to train a model (e.g., ML models X (<b>265</b>)). Specifically, the well intervention manager (e.g., well intervention manager X (<b>260</b>)) applies the model to generate a well intervention plan at a well site using data inputs regarding one or more well intervention providers and one or more well conditions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With respect to ML models, different types of ML models may be used, such as convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, inductive learning models, deductive learning models, unsupervised learning models, supervised learning models, reinforcement learning models, self-supervised learning models, etc. In some embodiments, a well intervention manager may generate augmented or synthetic data to produce a large amount of interpreted data for training a particular model. Likewise, a ML model may be trained using one or more ML algorithms. For example, a backpropagation algorithm may be used to train a neural network. The training data may include the predetermined scheduling criterion and data inputs from historical events regarding one or more well intervention providers and one or more well conditions. A well intervention manager may continue to train the ML model by self-feeding database (e.g., database X (<b>268</b>)) for historical learning process. Thus, the ML model predicts the well intervention plan for performance as the self-learning process of the algorithm is setup for retro alimentation upon the actual events as per desire.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With respect to neural networks, for example, a neural network may include one or more hidden layers, where a hidden layer includes one or more neurons. A neuron may be a modelling node or object that is loosely patterned on a neuron of the human brain. In particular, a neuron may combine data inputs with a set of coefficients, i.e., a set of network weights for adjusting the data inputs. These network weights may amplify or reduce the value of a particular data input, thereby assigning an amount of significance to various data inputs for a task being modeled. Through machine learning, a neural network may determine which data inputs should receive greater priority in determining one or more specified outputs of the neural network. Likewise, these weighted data inputs may be summed such that this sum is communicated through a neuron's activation function to other hidden layers within the neural network. As such, the activation function may determine whether and to what extent an output of a neuron progresses to other neurons where the output may be weighted again for use as an input to the next hidden layer.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the well intervention manager may perform one or more ML algorithms (e.g., an unsupervised ML algorithm, a reinforcement ML algorithm, a self-supervised ML algorithm, etc.) based on an obtained scheduling criterion and data inputs. In particular, a reinforcement learning algorithm may be a type of method that autonomously learns agent policies through multiple iterations of trials and evaluations based on data inputs. The objective of a reinforcement learning algorithm may be to learn an agent policy &#x3c0; that maps the state of a well intervention activity to a well intervention plan so as to maximize an expected reward J(&#x3c0;). A value reward may describe one or more qualities of data inputs for a particular well within an operation, such as a frac operation. For another example, a reinforcement learning algorithm may include an action selector engine to determine commands and/or pump actions based on policy data and one or more reward functions. More specifically, a reinforcement learning algorithm may train a policy to make a sequence of decisions based on the observed states of the environment to maximize the cumulative reward determined by a reward function. For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm may employ a trial-and-error procedure to determine one or more agent policies based on various agents interaction with a complex environment. As such, a reinforcement learning algorithm may include a reward function that teaches a particular action selection engine to follow certain rules, while still allowing the reinforcement learning model to retain information learned from data inputs regarding one or more well intervention providers and one or more well conditions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the well intervention manager may perform a self-supervised ML algorithm to train a model based on an obtained scheduling criterion and data inputs. In particular, a self-supervised learning is a subclass of unsupervised machine learning which requires only unlabeled data to provide the supervision and formulate a pretext learning task such as predicting context or image rotation for some part of the data. The objective of a self-supervised learning algorithm may force the neural network (e.g., a convolutional neural network) to learn a high-level semantic representation to solve the task of interest. For example, a self-supervised learning algorithm may calculate the similarity with semantic information of well intervention activity preference that is implicitly present within the well management network based on the scheduling criterion. The self-supervised learning algorithm may then calculate the similarity between the list of well intervention activities based on one or more qualities of data inputs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a well intervention manager is used to generate a well intervention plan within a well management network for planning, synchronizing and optimizing the logistics a well intervention plan using one or more ML algorithms (e.g., an unsupervised ML algorithm, a reinforcement ML algorithm, a self-supervised ML algorithm) to maximize operational efficiency, availing hydrocarbon and minimizing budget expenditure. In some embodiments, a first well intervention plan may be generated by the well intervention manager based on a predetermined scheduling criterion determined by a user based on real-time observed matters (e.g., safety concerns, contract terms, conditions, scope, cost, resources, weather, government, legal, etc.). The well intervention manager may apply one or more ML algorithms to adjust the predetermined scheduling criterion based on new data. The well intervention manager may apply one or more ML algorithms to accommodate the adjusted scheduling criterion within seconds and re-arrange different operations. The well intervention manager automatically re-schedules the well intervention plan for emerging issues based on an adjusted scheduling criterion. In doing so, the well intervention may eliminate new conflicts and human errors.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, the well intervention manager may apply one or more ML algorithms to generate multiple well intervention plans for different well scenarios for a well site of interest based on an adjusted scheduling criterion by using real-time well data. Accordingly, a well intervention manager may have the capability to adapt to different logistics conditions and schemes. In some embodiments, the adjusted well intervention plan is outputted for display for a user via a graphical user interface for a user to observe appearances, conflicts, and awareness of possible issues with the plan. For example, the well intervention manager may automatically self-feed and build a database for a historical learning process that clearly enumerates changes to a well intervention plan based on newly acquired data and statistical trends.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the well intervention manager may perform an unsupervised ML algorithm to train a model based on an obtained scheduling criterion and data inputs. In particular, unsupervised learning requires only unlabeled data to build a compact internal representation to formulate a pattern learning task for the data inputs. The objective of an unsupervised learning algorithm may force the neural network to learn the compact internal representation (e.g., natural clusters) of data inputs based on multiple attributes to solve the task of interest. For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm builds a well intervention plan and classifies the pattern of well intervention activities based on an obtained scheduling criterion. These natural clusters are given various priorities to solve the task. For example, a natural cluster &#x201c;1&#x201d; is given a &#x201c;high&#x201d; priority when the well intervention activity is urgent and all the required tools and materials are available. For another example, a natural cluster &#x201c;5&#x201d; is given a &#x201c;low&#x201d; priority when the well intervention activity is not urgent and all the required tools and materials are unavailable. The unsupervised learning algorithm then classifies the list of well intervention activities by using multiple natural clusters for the compact internal representation based on one or more qualities of data inputs (e.g., scheduling criteria X (<b>261</b>), well data X (<b>263</b>), inventory availability data (<b>268</b>), and/or service provider data (<b>266</b>)) for a particular well (e.g., well B (<b>220</b>)) and convergence items for recommendation based on the analysis of the pattern of natural clusters that characterize the list of well intervention activities. The top N natural clusters have the highest priorities are recommended as the new convergence items for the particular well.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> shows various configurations of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

In some embodiments, a ML algorithm trains a model to build the well intervention plan based on specific input features (e.g., data inputs). For example, the well intervention manager may build multiple well intervention plans within seconds to accommodate multiple sets of data inputs for different well scenarios depending on the user defined importance of variables which are flexible to change when required (swap importance relevance of setup by incidents, cost, contract, performance, etc.). As another example, the well intervention manager displays the well intervention plan to observe appearance, conflicts and awareness as per setup. The well intervention manager makes decisions that the scheduling criterion and/or the well intervention plan need adjustment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, the well intervention manager assesses the statistical trend of data inputs as an additional value to enhance the automatic machine learning self-decision process of the schedule. Thus, the well intervention manager may allow flexibility to accommodate real-time changes on the fly for any observed matters (e.g., safety concerns, government, weather, legal, etc.) to improve robustness of the schedule by advising about possible issues. The well intervention manager assesses the well intervention plans for different well scenarios in order to better arrange a forward schedule based on the obtained real-time data from actual processes and real events. As such, the well intervention manger accommodates substantial amount of site planning, emerging issues, and rescheduling well intervention operations.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In Block <b>330</b>, a determination is made whether to update a scheduling criterion in accordance with one or more embodiments.

For example, the well intervention manager may independently access each data input in the context of a scheduling criterion (e.g., assign the data input no weight or significant weight). The well intervention manager may process well data, resource data, and/or service provider data in order to discard various cases that cannot satisfy a particular scheduling criterion. The well intervention manager may arrange the possible well intervention plan to restrict and/or arrange multiple options in a well intervention plan. Once a well intervention plan is built, a well intervention plan may provide a schedule of various tasks for implementing the well intervention plan. The well intervention plan may be displayed with various conflicts and awareness being highlighted. The well intervention manager may decide if an adjustment is needed based on newly acquired data or a new analysis of existing data. Likewise, the well intervention manager may send a request to a user device for feedback regarding the existing well intervention plan. Once a final well intervention plan with a final schedule is drafted, the plan may proceed to final approval.

Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, a reservoir's requirements (<b>511</b>) are determined using data inputs and revised data inputs from production enhancement requirements (<b>513</b>), drilling requirements (<b>514</b>), hydrocarbon demand requirements (<b>512</b>), reservoir change requirements (<b>515</b>), and tie-in requirements (<b>516</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, production requirements (<b>521</b>) are determined by hydrocarbon demand requirements (<b>522</b>), maintaining hydrocarbon production requirements (<b>523</b>), field surveillance requirements (<b>524</b>), and production facilities requirements (<b>525</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, maintenance and servicing requirements (<b>531</b>) are determined using data inputs from well workover requirements (<b>532</b>), surveillance, inspection, testing, and sampling (<b>533</b>), well servicing requirements (<b>534</b>), and data regarding well emergencies (<b>535</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, a field implementation (<b>541</b>) is determined using data regarding rig operations and workover (<b>542</b>), rigless operations (<b>543</b>), maintenance and servicing (<b>544</b>), and wells tie-ins (<b>545</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, oilfield activity planning is a very demanding task and requires inputs from various sources. Some input sources may include reservoir requirements, hydrocarbon production requirements, maintenance and servicing requirements, and field implementation outputs (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). These input sources may depend on secondary inputs that are dynamic in nature. For example, various reservoir requirements may depend on several data inputs such as hydrocarbon demand, drilling requirements, production enhancement requirements, reservoir changes, and tie-in requirements (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). As such, reservoir requirements may be used to forecast a required hydrocarbon production based on global demands (e.g., for planning the number of new wells needed to be drilled to meet the required hydrocarbon production). Likewise, reservoir requirements may change the reservoir targets on existing wells to meet new or different production targets. In addition, reservoir requirements may forecast tie-in plans to connect certain wells to hydrocarbon production facilities. Similarly, production requirements (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>) may depend on hydrocarbon demand in terms of particular types and qualities, such as crude oil grade, sweet or sour natural gas, etc. Other data inputs may arise from the need to maintain hydrocarbon production capacity from one or more existing wells. Example of such data inputs may include stimulation or performing scale removal to restore well productivity at one or more wells. In addition, some scheduling requirements may arise from the status of the hydrocarbon processing facilities. For example, some well activities and well tasks may be unable to be performed if the hydrocarbon processing facility is not operational (e.g., a processing plant is shut down for maintenance and inspection, or an emergency situation occurs). In contrast, other tasks may be performed while the processing facility is shut down. A well intervention manager may use these different data sources to adjust one or more well intervention plans. Moreover, production requirement inputs may be based on monitoring and acquiring well data, field data, and reservoir data through various surveillance activities such as well corrosion monitoring and acquiring static bottom hole pressure, etc.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">With regard to the maintenance and servicing requirements (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>), several inputs may be used, such as performing maintenance on the well through rig workover. Thus, workover operations may be performed to replace corroded tubings, or repairing tubing annulus communication for example. Other data inputs may include surveillance, inspection, testing and sampling such as annuli survey, landing base inspection, wellhead valve integrity tests, and surface sampling of reservoir fluids such as water sampling. In addition, wells servicing may be required such as wellhead valves cycling and greasing and wellhead repairs. Also, in emergency situations, wells may need to be attended to control the emergency situation (e.g., by shutting the well or installing an isolation plugs). In case of an emergency, a well Intervention manager may identify all the affected wells faster in order to be shut-in and control the emergency situation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Based on the acquired data inputs, well intervention manager may generate one or more plans and task schedules. In some embodiments, a well intervention manager estimates required budgets as well as time and resources to perform various tasks in addition to estimating hydrocarbon gains. Thus, a well intervention manager may also provide feedback and/or recommendations or suggested changes to the different input sources to meet various constraints such as available resources and allocated budgets. Once well intervention plan is approved and executed, the well intervention manager may collect the input information from the different sources (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>) such as rig and workover operations details, rigless operations details, maintenance and servicing details, tie-in details, surveillance outputs, and sampling output. Those data sources may generate information such as the rig and rigless site reports, stimulation job reports, maintenance reports, and logging output. Data input sources may also form the feedline to provide the data needed for a machine learning process, where a system may utilize machine-learning algorithms to read and compare acquired data with a particular plan. Thus, a system may identify changes that occurred during an implementation phase (e.g., problems and contingencies that arose, changes in field and reservoirs' conditions, etc.). Some processes may be thus repeated in a different plan, while incorporating knowledge gains from previous cycles.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Embodiments may be implemented on a computer system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer system (<b>602</b>) used to provide computational functionalities associated with described algorithms, methods, functions, processes, flows, and procedures as described in the instant disclosure, according to an implementation.
