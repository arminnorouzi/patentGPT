Total ankle replacement (TAR), as it is commonly referred to, is typically not as clinically successful as other total joint replacements (i.e. knee, hip, shoulder). The failure rates of TAR procedures are sometimes two or three times greater than total knee or total hip replacement.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the more difficult aspects of a TAR procedure is manually aligning the patient's ankle joint so that the surgeon may make the appropriate bone resection cuts. The location and accuracy of the bone resection cuts determine the location of the total ankle implant and ultimately determine how well the implant will function and to what extent the patient's quality of life has improved. Accordingly, making accurate incisions is critical to a successful surgery and recovery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ankle joint must be appropriately aligned with long axis of the tibial bone in order to place the implant where it will most effectively provide the requisite range of motion and counteract the forces experienced in daily activities, such as walking, jogging, standing, etc. There are six degrees of freedom that must be aligned by the surgeon during the surgery. The alignment of the ankle joint is achieved with instruments used to prepare the tibial and talar bones in preparation of implant placement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be desirable to provide instruments and tools that ensure surgeons and other medical personnel can perform reliable and accurate alignment of a patient's ankle joint prior to and during surgery.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Surgical guide assemblies, methods, and modular systems are disclosed herein that generally aid with alignment of tools and instruments during surgical procedures.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, a surgical guide is disclosed. The surgical guide includes at least one first surgical instrument having at least one first bone contact interface configured to mate with at least a portion of a patient's bony anatomy, and at least one first connection interface configured to mate with at least one connection interface formed on different surgical instruments. At least one second surgical instrument is also provided. The second surgical instrument includes at least one second bone contact interface configured to mate with at least a portion of the patient's bony anatomy, and at least one second connection interface configured to mate with the at least one first connection interface such that the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument are linked to form an assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When both the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument are contacting a patient's bony anatomy, the assembly is oriented in a predetermined manner relative to the patient's bony anatomy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third surgical instrument is also included that has at least one third connection interface configured to mate with the at least one first connection interface, at least one guide opening or aperture for guiding at least one fourth surgical instrument, and at least one adjustable mechanism configured to reposition the at least one guide opening or aperture relative to the patient's bony anatomy.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method of aligning at least one surgical instrument including at least one guide opening is also provided. The method can include providing at least one first surgical instrument and at least one second surgical instrument. The method includes arranging at least one of the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument on a patient's bone. The method also includes linking the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument with each other to form an assembly. Next, the method includes removing the at least one second surgical instrument from the at least one bone, leaving the at least one first surgical instrument in a desired alignment position relative to the patient. The method also includes aligning at least one third surgical instrument with the at least one first surgical instrument and with the at least one bone of the patient, and linking the at least one third surgical instrument with the at least one first surgical instrument. The at least one third surgical instrument includes at least one guide opening, and the method includes guiding at least one fourth surgical instrument through the at least one guide opening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a surgical guide is provided. The surgical guide includes at least one first surgical instrument comprising at least one first bone contact interface configured to mate with a portion of bone and at least one first connection interface. The surgical guide also includes at least one second surgical instrument comprising at least one second bone contact interface configured to mate with a portion a bone, and a second connection interface configured to mate with the at least one first surgical instrument to form an assembly. The assembly of the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument is oriented in a predetermined manner relative to the patient's bony anatomy when both the at least one first surgical instrument and the at least one second surgical instrument are contacting a patient's bony anatomy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of aligning surgical instruments relative to a patient is also provided. The method includes providing a first instrument including a first bone contact interface and a second bone contact interface, the first bone contact interface and the second bone contact interface each being configured to contact a different bone in a patient. The first surgical instrument further includes a first connection interface configured to mechanically link the first instrument with at least two other instruments. A second instrument is also provided that includes a second connection interface configured to mate with the first connection interface and a third bone contact interface configured to contact the same bone as the first bone contact interface. At least one third instrument is also provided that defines an aperture or guide opening configured to receive a cutting tool. The at least one third instrument also includes a third connection interface that is also configured to mate with the first connection interface. The method includes connecting the first instrument and the second instrument, and arranging the first instrument and the second instrument in contact with a patient's bony anatomy. The method includes removing the second instrument from the first instrument such that the first instrument remains engaged with the patient's bony anatomy. The method then includes attaching the third instrument to the first instrument, and removing the first instrument from the third instrument such that the third instrument remains engaged with the patient's bony anatomy.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other embodiments are disclosed herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foregoing Summary and the following Detailed Description will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings, which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention.

A protrusion or bump can be placed under the patient's calf to maintain proper rotation of the patient's leg. The patient's patella is arranged to face directly anterior. General or regional anesthesia may be used. If using regional anesthesia, the sciatic or popliteal catheter must be positioned in a way that does not interfere with the surgery. A thigh tourniquet is generally used proximal to the popliteal catheter. Intravenous antibiotics and sequential compression are used on the contralateral leg. The leg is prepared and draped using proper sterile technique, leaving the knee to foot exposed. Exsanguination is performed prior to tourniquet activation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A skin incision is made just lateral to the tibial crest from approximately 6 cm proximal of the tibial plafond, and extending distal up to the talonavicular joint. The superficial peroneal nerve is identified and mobilized laterally. The extensor retinaculum and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) tendon sheath are exposed, but the anterior tibial tendon sheath cannot be exposed. The deep peroneal nerve and artery are then identified and mobilized laterally. It is important to protect these structures throughout the procedure. Finally, the ankle joint capsule is incised longitudinally and exposed from the medial malleolus to the syndesmosis. Osteophytes on the neck of the talus and anterior tibia must be removed. It is important to avoid weakening the underlying bone by removing too much substrate. If a <i>varus </i>deformity requires correction, a deltoid release is performed. It is important to release the talar deltoid attachment from anterior to posterior as a single structure. As explained above, these surgeries and procedures are complicated and require that surgeons can correctly, accurately, and precisely have access to specific portions of the patient's anatomy. Accordingly, the subject matter disclosed herein provides an improved tool, process, and method of aligning surgical instruments and tools relative to a patent.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aspects and embodiments of a surgical guide are disclosed herein that aid surgeons in operating on patients during surgeries, such as total ankle replacement surgeries.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A first surgical instrument <b>100</b> and a second surgical instrument <b>200</b> are generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>I</figref>. These two instruments <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are generally configured to work in conjunction with each other to aid in the alignment of tools and instruments relative to a patient's anatomy.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the first surgical instrument <b>100</b> has a first bone contact interface <b>101</b> that is configured to engage with a least a portion of a patient's bones, such as a first bone <b>300</b> of a patient. The first bone <b>300</b> can be the tibia, or any other bone.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the terms surgical instrument, instrument or tool are used interchangeably. Additionally, in one aspect, the term instrument refers to a modular tool that primarily is configured to both engage with other tools or instruments and also is configured to interact with a patient, either via bone contacting surfaces, apertures for receiving guide wires or K-wires, slots configured to receive cutting tools, or other features.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one aspect, the first bone contact interface <b>101</b> is configured to contact, interface, or mate with a patient's tibia. One skilled in the art would understand that the first bone contact interface <b>101</b> can be configured to contact, interface, or mate with other bones or patient anatomy. The first bone contact interface <b>101</b> generally includes a curved surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>E, and <b>2</b></figref>. The specific profile and geometry of the first bone contact interface <b>101</b> can be precisely selected to match a patient's anatomy using imaging techniques. In other words, the first bone contact interface <b>101</b> can be customized or tailored to match a patient's geometry. In one aspect, this process is based on a negative mold of a patient's anatomy, which can be based on electronic imaging data or other techniques.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first surgical instrument <b>100</b> also includes a connection interface <b>102</b>, which is also referred to as a first connection interface. In one aspect, the connection interface <b>102</b> is a surface designed to allow the first surgical instrument <b>100</b> to mate or connect with additional surgical instruments. In one aspect, the connection interface <b>102</b> can include a slot <b>102</b><i>a </i>including a pair of arms <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>. In one aspect, the slot <b>102</b><i>a </i>is configured to receive a protrusion. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that alternatively, the connection interface <b>102</b> can be a protrusion and a slot can be formed on another instrument to connect with the protrusion. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, each of the arms <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>extend for an entire edge of a base body <b>110</b> of the first instrument <b>100</b>. Other types of connection interfaces can be used.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first surgical instrument <b>100</b> can also comprise a second bone contact interface <b>103</b> configured to mate with a second bone of a patient <b>400</b>, such as the talus. The specific profile and geometry of the second bone contact interface <b>103</b> can be precisely selected to match a patient's anatomy using imaging techniques. In other words, the second bone contact interface <b>103</b> can be customized or tailored to match a patient's geometry. In one aspect, this process is based on a negative mold of a patient's anatomy, which can be based on electronic imaging data or other techniques.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A joint or interface is defined between the first bone <b>300</b> and the second bone <b>400</b>.
