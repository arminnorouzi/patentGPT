In modern buildings, such as in modern vehicles, more and more glass is used and as thermal comfort is required, multiple glazing is commonly used.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiple glazing means a glazing unit with at least two glass panels combined together by a means of maintaining the two glass panels at a certain distance between the two glass panels. The glass panel placed outside of the building is called the outer glass panel where the other one is called the inner glass panel. To maintain the two glass panels at a certain distance one from the other, a spacer can be used in the periphery of the glazing unit with gas in the volume created between these two glass panels, pillars can be used between the two glass panels and a vacuum is created between these two glass panels, called vacuum insulated glazing (VIG). Usually, surfaces of glass panels have two main surfaces, one is oriented towards the outside of the building, vehicle, . . . while the other surface is oriented towards the inside of the building, vehicle, . . . These surfaces are named Sij where i and j are positive integers where i represents a reference to the glass panel itself and j represents the surface of this glass panel. The surface Sij with j number equals to one (S<b>11</b>, S<b>21</b>, . . . ) corresponds to the surface facing the outside of the building, vehicle, . . . The surface Sij with j number equals to two (S<b>12</b>, S<b>22</b>, . . . ) corresponds to the surface facing the inside of the building, vehicle, . . . In a multiple glazing comprising a first glass panel with S<b>11</b> and S<b>12</b> surfaces and a second glazing panel with surfaces S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>21</b> are facing each other to create a volume between these two glass panels.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other words, surfaces of a glazing unit can be summarized as from outside of the building: S<b>11</b>/S<b>12</b>/volume/S<b>21</b>/S<b>22</b> then the inside of the building.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In case of the glass panel has more than one glass sheet, inside surfaces are named Sij where j starts from 3 to the number of surfaces. When the glass panel has two glass sheets, the two surfaces inside the glass panel are named Si<b>3</b> and Si<b>4</b>. In other words, surfaces of a glazing unit with the inner glass panel comprising two glass sheets can be summarized as from outside of the building : S<b>11</b>/S<b>13</b>/S<b>14</b>/S<b>12</b>/volume/S<b>21</b>/S<b>22</b> then the inside of the building.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to reduce the accumulation of heat in the interior of a building or vehicle, a glazing unit may be coated with a coating system, for example a solar control coating system, that absorbs or reflects solar energy. Inclusion of solar control films, particularly on glazing for use in warm, sunny climates, is desirable because they reduce the need for air conditioning or other temperature regulation methods. This affords savings in terms of energy consumption and environmental impact.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such coating systems, however, are typically electrically conductive and are highly reflective for Radio Frequency (RF) waves and low in transmittance for RF waves. This effect impedes reception or transmission by antennas (or wireless devices).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To ensure the thermal comfort inside the building, a coating system such as a thermal comfort coating can be provided on at least one of the inner surfaces of the two glass panels meaning in S<b>12</b> surface and/or S<b>21</b> surface. In case of a glass panel with more than one glass sheet, coating system can be placed on at least one of all surfaces of the glass panel, Si<b>1</b>, Si<b>2</b>, Si<b>3</b>, Si<b>4</b>, . . .</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This makes the coating systems effective broadband reflectors of radio frequency signals. Furthermore, commercial construction, automotive, train, . . . tend to use other materials that further block RF signals. Materials such as concrete, brick, mortar, steel, aluminum, roofing tar, gypsum wall board, and some types of wood all offer varying degrees of RF attenuation. The result is that many newer constructions severely impede RF signals from getting into or out of the buildings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, where a glazing unit according to the invention has several coating systems between the housing and the outside of the building, vehicle, . . . , each coating system has to have a decoated zone at least in front of the housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Nonetheless, RF devices have become an important part of modern life, especially with the huge penetration of cellular smartphones, tablets, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, that are requiring a deep penetration in buildings or automotive of electromagnetic field for indoor coverage, even at high spectrum frequency up to 70 GHz. Such devices may include cellular transceivers, wireless local area network (&#x201c;Wi-Fi&#x201d;) transceivers, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, Bluetooth transceivers and, in some cases, other RF receivers (e.g., FM/AM radio, UHF, etc.). As the popularity of such devices has grown, the importance of being able to use RF-based features within the confines of modern commercial buildings has grown.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, in order to increase the speed and capacity of wireless communication, frequency bands to be used are becoming higher, like the frequency bands for the 5th generation mobile communication system (5G). Therefore, even if a high-frequency electromagnetic wave having a broadband frequency band is used for a mobile communication, etc., it is necessary to have a wide band frequency selective surface in order to ensure the transmission of waves with different frequencies through the glazing unit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The ITU IMT-2020 specification demands speeds up to 20 Gbps, achievable with wide channel bandwidths and massive MIMO 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is going to submit 5G NR (New Radio) as its 5G communication standard proposal. 5G NR can include lower frequencies, below 6 GHz, and mm-Wave, above 15 GHz. On top of that, IoT will requires indoor coverage as good as possible not for massive MTC (Machine Type Communication) but for critical MTC where robots or industrial devices are 5G wireless remotely controlled.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Coating systems strongly attenuates EM signals when passing through glazing panels. And especially at mm-Wave, the signal level rapidly decreases due to high path loss. Many residential/commercial buildings therefore need outdoor, or outdoor-indoor repeaters and indoor CPEs. On top of that, an outdoor unit is typically undesirable for security reasons but also to provide easily power or to avoid environmental conditions that can damage the outdoor unit.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In case of the CPE and/or the repeater is placed inside the building, the signal is attenuated by at least 30 dB through glazing unit with a coated glass panel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some solutions provide a decoating portion on the coated glass panel. This decoated portion improves the signal inside the building but creates a narrow field of view. Especially at mm-Wave frequencies, beamforming is important to improve the signal to interference ratio (SIR) also because obstacles cause greater diffusion of the signal and less specular reflection meaning that there is higher propagation losses in NLOS. These solutions, to provide a greater field of view, need a greater decoated portion meaning loosing thermal performances of the glazing unit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a glazing unit capable of increasing the field of view from the indoor unit, capable to have a wide field of view and keeping higher chance to provide LOS link compared to existing solutions when beamforming for the transmission of waves with lower frequencies, below 6 GHz, and mm-Wave, above 15 GHz through the glazing unit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is an object of the present invention to alleviate these problems and especially the outdoor to indoor and/or the indoor to outdoor penetration, and to provide a glazing unit capable of increasing the field of view from the indoor unit, capable to have a wide field of view and keeping higher chance to provide LOS link compared to existing solutions for the transmission of waves with lower frequencies, below 6 GHz, and mm-Wave frequency, above 15 GHz through the glazing unit and shall be intended as an improvement. The present invention also provides a solution to improve the scanning range of beamforming, meaning a wider field of view, and a longer range of use.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a first aspect of the invention, the invention relates to an improved glazing unit extending along a plane, P, defined by a longitudinal axis, X, and a vertical axis, Z; having a width, DW, measured along the longitudinal axis, X, and a length, DL, measured along the vertical axis, Z, comprising, at least a first outer glass panel (<b>11</b>) having a S<b>11</b> surface and a S<b>12</b> surface and a second inner glass panel (<b>12</b>) having a S<b>21</b> surface and a S<b>22</b> surface combined together by at least a means (<b>13</b>) of maintaining the two glass panels at a certain distance between the surface S<b>12</b> of the first outer glass panel and the surface S<b>21</b> of the second inner glass sheet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At higher frequencies the two glass panels can be low or high in transmittance for RF waves depending on the polarization of the signal, the angle of incidence and the frequency. High in transmittance for RF radiation means that RF radiation are mostly transmitted through the material where low in transmittance for RF radiation means that RF radiation are mostly reflected on the surface of the material and/or absorbed by the material and the attenuation is at level of 20 decibels (dB) or more. High in transmittance means an attenuation at level of 10 decibels (dB) or less. The coating system which is low in transmittance for RF radiation means that the coating system is blocking RF radiation to pass through the glazing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The glazing unit also comprises a housing able to accommodate a 4G and/or 5G communication device having at least one antenna.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The glazing unit further comprises an opening arranged on the second inner glass panel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Alternatively, the glazing unit comprises a 4G and/or 5G signal communication device and preferably, the communication device is inserted into the housing, more preferably the communication device is fixed inside the housing. In some embodiments according to the invention, the communication device is a mm-Wave signal communication device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, the housing comprises side parts and a cover and in some embodiments, he housing can comprise a bottom surrounded by side parts. The bottom can be a plain or with at least one hole in order to optimize the communication. This bottom can have a flat or free center part to avoid signal issues. Borders of the bottom can be curved to fulfil with other parts of the housing.

Although coating system are thin and mainly transparent to eyes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The coating system can be made of layers of different materials and at least one of this layer is electrically conductive.

The coating system of the present invention may comprise a metal based low emissive coating system; these coatings typically are a system of thin layers comprising one or more, for example two, three or four, functional layers based on an infrared radiation reflecting material and at least two dielectric coatings, wherein each functional layer is surrounded by dielectric coatings. The coating system of the present invention may in particular have an emissivity of at least 0.010. The functional layers are generally layers of silver with a thickness of some nanometers, mostly about 5 to 20 nm. Concerning the dielectric layers, they are transparent and traditionally each dielectric layer is made from one or more layers of metal oxides and/or nitrides. These different layers are deposited, for example, by means of vacuum deposition techniques such as magnetic field-assisted cathodic sputtering, more commonly referred to as &#x201c;magnetron sputtering&#x201d;. In addition to the dielectric layers, each functional layer may be protected by barrier layers or improved by deposition on a wetting layer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the coating system is applied to the glazing unit <b>1</b> to transform it to a low-E glazing unit. This metal-based coating system such as low-E or heatable coating systems.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiment, the coating system can be a heatable coating applied on the glazing unit to add a defrosting and/or a demisting function for example.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As the coating system, for example, a conductive film can be used. As the conductive film, for example, a laminated film obtained by sequentially laminating a transparent dielectric, a metal film, and a transparent dielectric, ITO, fluorine-added tin oxide (FTO), or the like can be used. As the metal film, for example, a film containing as a main component at least one selected from the group consisting of Ag, Au, Cu, and Al can be used.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Preferably, the coating system is placed on the majority of one surface of the glazing unit and more preferably on the whole used surface of the glass pane.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, a masking element, such as an enamel layer, can be add on a part of the periphery of the glazing unit.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A simple approach to this problem of RF energy reflection is to remove a portion of the coating system to avoid to have a high reflectance for RF radiation. This approach, however, reduces the solar control benefits offered by the glazing unit and for equipment located inside the building, the vehicle or the car, the region would be unacceptably large. On top of that, the transition between the decoated zone and the coating itself is eye-visible and usually non-accepted by users.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Another solution has been to cut lines in the coating system to create a surface which is frequency selective, that is, it has relatively high reflectivity/absorbance for solar energy but relatively high in transmittance in the RF region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The cutting may be performed by laser ablation and the spacing of the slits is chosen to provide selectivity at the desired frequency.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In embodiments where the coating system is placed on S<b>12</b>, a decoated zone is present in front of the housing allowing waves to pass through the first glass pane to the device.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The decoated zone can be a zone without coating and because this zone is small compared to the size of the first inner glass pane thermal performances are not impacted. The decoated zone can be a frequency selective surface.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to the invention, the frequency selective decoated zone of the coating system may be a series or patterns of intersecting ablated paths may be created in the coating system, while leaving behind the coating system in untouched areas and only a very small percentage of the area of the coating system is removed from the glazing panel, and most of the coated glass remains untouched to keep performances of the coating system.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">These paths are produced in such a way as to create areas of the coating system allowing the glazing panel to retain most of its energy conserving properties or heatable properties, while the ablated paths allow passage of RF signals through the glazing panel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In various embodiments, paths can be made by pulse laser to create spots. The diameter of the spot is about 20-25 um, so that each path will be approximately this width. In alternative embodiments, different sized spots (e.g., 10-200 microns in diameter) and paths may be used. Moreover, the spots overlap and the amount of overlap may be approximately 50% by area; the extent of overlap may vary in alternative embodiments. In some embodiments, the overlap may range from 25% to over 90% for example. The pattern of ablated intersecting paths may be varied.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the decoated area of a coated system may be 40% or less of the total coated area depending of the application, the material used in the glazing unit, . . . In other embodiments, a different percentage may be used (e.g. 5% or less total area of the coating system removed, and 95% total area of a coating system retaining untouched). In other embodiments, the coated system is decoated on at least one portion of his surface, this decoated zone represents less than 2% of the coating in this zone. In others embodiments, several decoated zone can be present and the decoated surface is at most 3% of the total coated area.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The decoated zone can be made on other parts of the surface of the glass pane, then another percentage can be done. Some designs can also change in percentage.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Note that while ablation of a higher percentage of the area may improve the transmission of RF signals through the glazing unit, ablation of more of the coating system diminishes the energy conserving properties heatable and performances of the glazing unit.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>8</b></figref>, a housing <b>20</b> according to the invention is fixed on the S<b>12</b> surface of the first outer glass pane <b>11</b> allowing to have a better tolerances with glass pane thicknesses while having a better matching for high angles of incidences.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The housing can be made of different parts <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>26</b>.
