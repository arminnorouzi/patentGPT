However, in a data center, a hard disk is still a main data storage medium. Once the hard disk fails, a risk of data loss will be produced, bringing serious loss to the enterprise. Therefore, predicting the failures of the hard disk is a very important step to ensure the data storage security.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, monitoring data used for representing a status of the hard disk is first acquired from the hard disk; a hard disk failure prediction model is established according to an incremental random forest algorithm and the acquired monitoring data; and the failure situation of the hard disk is predicted through the hard disk failure prediction model. However, the status of the hard disk is constantly changing, and the monitoring data acquired from the hard disk also increases accordingly. Using the same failure prediction model in an incremental scenario will gradually reduce the accuracy of prediction results.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, in order to prevent the accuracy of the prediction results from gradually decreasing, a method for re-establishing a hard disk failure prediction model is usually adopted. However, re-establishing the failure model requires re-collection of a large amount of data, and the incremental random forest algorithm is used to perform complex calculations, so that the operation steps are cumbersome and consume time greatly.

Updating of a decision tree in a hard disk prediction model is completed by determining leaf nodes requiring updating in a current hard disk prediction model and only updating each leaf node, so that updating of the entire hard disk prediction model is completed.

During the building of a hard disk failure prediction model, detection data of a hard disk is first acquired, and is then standardized, normalized, and equalized to be preprocessed. The preprocessed detection data is used as a training sample, and training is carried out according to the random forest algorithm to obtain the hard disk failure prediction model. The disclosure provides, according to the hard disk failure prediction model formed by the above method, a method for updating a hard disk prediction model.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, first sample data to be used to update the hard disk prediction model is first acquired. Specifically, the first sample data is specifically SMART data newly added in a hard disk. In the embodiment of the disclosure, the SMART data newly added in a time period from last prediction time to current time is used as the first sample data. Those skilled in the art can also determine, according to an actual application situation, other data to be the first sample data, which is not limited by the embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a specific embodiment, the first sample data is input to the hard disk prediction model to determine a target decision tree requiring updating in the hard disk prediction model. In an embodiment, the step that the target decision tree requiring updating in the hard disk prediction model is determined according to the first sample data specifically includes:</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">inputting respective data in the first sample data into respective decision trees of the hard disk prediction model in sequence, and respectively recording prediction results obtained from the respective data in the respective decision trees;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">comparing the prediction results with actual results corresponding to the respective data, and calculating prediction accuracies of the respective decision trees; and</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">determining that a decision tree with a prediction accuracy less than a target accuracy is the target decision tree.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, all data contained in the first sample data are input into the respective decision trees of the hard disk prediction model in sequence, and prediction results obtained from the respective data in the respective decision trees are recorded. It can be understood that the prediction results are specifically information used for indicating that the hard disk fails or is normal. Furthermore, when the first sample data is acquired, actual results represented by the respective data are known. For example, actual results corresponding to data in the first ten minutes before the hard disk fails are determined to be failed, and actual results corresponding to other data are determined to be normal. If a hard disk has not had any type of failure yet, it can be determined that the actual results corresponding to all the data contained in the first sample data are normal. The method for acquiring the actual results corresponding to the sample data in detail may refer to the prior art, which is not described in detail here.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The prediction results of the respective data are compared with the actual results to determine an amount of data with the prediction results consistent with the actual results, and the prediction accuracies of the respective decision trees are calculated. The prediction accuracy (Accuracy) can be calculated through the following formula:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>Accuracy</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mrow>     <mi>TP</mi>     <mo>+</mo>     <mi>TN</mi>    </mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>P</mi>     <mo>+</mo>     <mi>N</mi>    </mrow>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#xd7;</mo>   <mn>100</mn>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>%</mi>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0054" num="0000">where TP represents an amount of data whose actual results are normal and prediction results are normal; TN represents an amount of data whose actual results are failed and prediction results are failed; P represents an amount of data whose actual results are normal among the first sample data; and N represents an amount of data whose actual results are failed among the first sample data. It can be understood that a sum of TP and TN is the amount of data with the prediction results consistent with the actual results, and a sum of P and N is a total amount of the data in the first sample data. For example, the first sample data contains 100 pieces of data, and the hard disk prediction model contains 10 decision trees. After the first sample data passes through the first decision tree in the hard disk prediction model, if the prediction results of 30 pieces of data are consistent with the actual results, the prediction accuracy of the first decision tree is 30%.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">According to the above method, the prediction accuracies of the respective decision trees are determined. A decision tree with a prediction accuracy less than a target accuracy is determined to be the target decision tree. In an embodiment, the target accuracy is specifically an average of the prediction accuracies of all the decision trees. Those skilled in the art can also determine, according to an actual application situation, other numerical values to be the target accuracy, which is not limited by the embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Step S<b>102</b>: second sample data is selected from the first sample data according to a preset selection rule.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">In an embodiment, the preset selection rule is specifically as follows: selecting data with prediction results inconsistent with actual results from the first sample data as the second sample data. For example, after 100 pieces of data in the first sample data pass through the target decision tree, if the prediction results obtained from 40 pieces of data are inconsistent with the actual results, the 40 pieces of data are selected as the second sample data.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">Step S<b>103</b>: a target leaf node requiring updating in the target decision tree is determined according to the second sampling data.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">Step S<b>104</b>: the target leaf node is split according to a splitting rule of the hard disk prediction model so as to update the target decision tree.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">In specific implementation, respective data in the second sample data is traversed on the target decision tree, and the target leaf node requiring updating is determined according to current decision information obtained from each leaf node of the target decision tree, which specifically includes:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">inputting the second sample data into the target decision tree, and determining whether current decision information obtained by each leaf node in the target decision tree is consistent with stored historical decision information; and</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">determining that the leaf node is the target leaf node if the current decision information is not consistent with the stored historical decision information.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">It should be noted that the current decision information is decision information obtained during current traversing, and the historical decision information is stored decision information obtained by the leaf node last time. When the current decision information of a leaf node is inconsistent with the historical decision information, it can be determined that the leaf node is the target leaf node. The target leaf node is split according to the splitting rule of the hard disk prediction model so as to update the target decision tree. After the updating of all the target decision trees is completed, the updating of the hard disk prediction model is completed. It should be noted that the detail splitting rule of the hard disk prediction model may refer to the prior art, which is not described in detail in the embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">In an embodiment, the first sample data to be used to update the hard disk prediction model can be regularly acquired according to an actual application situation, thus realizing regular updating of the hard disk prediction model.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">According to a method for updating a hard disk prediction model provided by the disclosure, first sample data to be used to update a hard disk prediction model is first acquired, and a target decision tree requiring updating in the hard disk prediction model is determined according to the first sample data; second sample data is selected from the first sample data according to a preset selection rule; a target leaf node requiring updating in the target decision tree is determined according to the second sample data; and the target leaf node is split according to a splitting rule of the hard disk prediction model so as to update the target decision tree.
