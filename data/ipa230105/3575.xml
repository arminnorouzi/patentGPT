Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the priority of European patent application no. 19213599.4 and the priority of European patent application no. 19213597.8, the disclosure of both documents is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus and to a method for carrying out polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy on a sample, in particular a crystalline or polycrystalline sample.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spectroscopy generally refers to the process of measuring energy or intensity as a function of wavelength in a beam of light. Spectroscopy uses absorption, emission, or scattering of light by physical matter, in particular atoms, molecules or ions, to qualitatively and quantitatively study physical properties and processes of matter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Light or radiation directed at a sample during operation of a spectrometer system may be referred to as incident radiation. Redirection of incident radiation following contact with the sample is commonly referred to as scattering of radiation. To the extent that atoms or molecules in a sample absorb all or a portion of the incident radiation, rather than reflect incident radiation, a sample may become excited, and the energy level of the sample may be increased to a higher energy level. Light may be scattered but may continue to have the same wavelength as the incident radiation, a condition commonly referred to as Rayleigh or elastically scattered light. Incident radiation that is scattered by the sample during, for example, a change of vibrational state in molecules may be scattered with a different energy, and such scattered light may be called Raman scattered light. Such phenomena have been used in conjunction with spectroscopy to qualitatively and quantitatively study physical properties and processes, including identification of chemical properties, compositions, and structures of samples.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If incident radiation is directed at a sample, the wavelength of the incident radiation may remain substantially unchanged in scattered radiation. Alternatively, if incident radiation is directed at a sample, the wavelength in the scattered radiation may acquire one or more different wavelengths than the incident wavelength. The energy differential between the incident radiation and the scattered radiation may be referred to as a Raman shift. Spectroscopic measurement of Raman scattered light may seek to measure the resulting wavelengths of such scattered light.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The phenomenon of Raman scattered light is useful in spectroscopy applications for studying qualities and quantities of physical properties and processes, including identification of chemical properties, compositions, and structure in a sample. Raman shift spectroscopic analytical techniques are used for qualitative and quantitative studies of samples. If incident radiation is used to scatter light from a sample, and scattered radiation data is measured, the scattered radiation may provide one or more frequencies associated with the sample, as well as the intensities of those shifted frequencies. The frequencies may be used to identify the chemical composition of a sample.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Raman spectrometers are an example of spectrometers for measuring inelastically scattered light and they are commonly used for obtaining a Raman spectrum of a sample. When a sample is irradiated with monochromatic light, for example from a laser, the light scattered by the sample will contain wavelength components different from those present in the incident light. The so-called Raman scattering of light on molecules present in the sample usually creates this effect. In a Raman spectrometer, the light scattered by the sample is collected and the spectral distribution of the wavelength components having a wavelength different from that of the light source is detected, e.g. in form of a digital image.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some measurements of Raman spectra, it may be desired to obtain information about the polarization of the Raman scattered light. For example, polarization dependent characteristics of Raman scattering are dependent on single crystalline quality and crystallographic orientation of a substrate, consisting of, for example, a single crystalline silicon (Si) wafer. Ramabadran et al. describe in the scientific publication: &#x201c;Intensity analysis of polarized Raman spectra for off axis single crystal silicon&#x201d;, Materials Science &#x26; Engineering B 230, p. 31-42, 2018 that polarized backscattered Raman spectroscopy can be used for identifying the crystallographic orientation of silicon cut off axis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Munisso et al. propose in the scientific publication &#x201c;Raman tensor analysis of sapphire single crystal and its application to define crystallographic orientation in polycrystalline alumina&#x201d;, Phys. Status Solidi B 246, No. 8, 1893-1900 (2009) a tensorial algorithm for the practical determination of unknown crystallographic textures in polycrystalline alumina materials.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">WO 03/089890 A1 discloses an imaging spectrometer that comprises a polarising beam splitter, such as a Wollaston prism.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an objective of the present invention to provide efficient means for carrying out polarization resolved spectroscopy on a sample, in particular a crystalline or polycrystalline sample.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The objective is satisfied by an apparatus in accordance with the features of claim <b>1</b>. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An apparatus for carrying out polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy on a sample, in particular a crystalline or polycrystalline sample, comprises at least one light source, in particular at least one laser, for providing excitation radiation to a surface of the sample,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">an optical system which is configured to collect at least one off-axis Raman beam from Raman light scattered by the sample in response to exposing the surface of the sample to the excitation radiation,</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the at least one off-axis Raman beam being scattered from the sample in a direction that is inclined with regard to an optical axis of an objective, which is configured to collect the at least one off-axis Raman beam,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">wherein the optical system further comprises at least one polarizer device for generating at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam from the collected at least one off-axis Raman beam, and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">wherein the optical system further comprises at least one spectrometer for generating an optical spectrum from the at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the optical system is configured to simultaneously collect at least one on-axis Raman beam in addition to the at least one off-axis Raman beam, wherein the at least one on-axis Raman beam is scattered from the sample in a direction that is aligned with an optical axis of an objective of the optical system, which is configured to collect the at least one on-axis Raman beam. Furthermore, the at least one polarizer device is configured to generate at least one polarized on-axis Raman beam from the at least one on-axis Raman beam. Moreover, the at least one spectrometer is configured to generate, in particular simultaneously, an optical spectrum from each of the at least one polarized on-axis Raman beam and the at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">At least in some embodiment, an apparatus for carrying out polarization resolved Raman spectroscopy on a sample, in particular a crystalline or polycrystalline sample, comprises</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">at least one light source, in particular at least one laser, for providing excitation radiation to a surface of the sample,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">an optical system which is configured to simultaneously collect, from Raman light scattered by the sample in response to exposing the surface to the excitation radiation, at least one on-axis Raman beam and at least one off-axis Raman beam,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">the at least one on-axis Raman beam being scattered from the sample in a direction that is aligned with an optical axis of an objective of the optical system for collecting the at least one on-axis Raman beam,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">the at least one off-axis Raman beam being scattered from the sample in a direction that is inclined with regard to an optical axis of an objective of the optical system for collecting the at least one on-axis Raman beam,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">the optical system comprising at least one polarizer device for generating at least one polarized on-axis Raman beam from the at least one on-axis Raman beam and at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam from the at least one off-axis Raman beam, and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">the optical system comprising at least one spectrometer for generating an optical spectrum from each of the at least one polarized on-axis Raman beam and the at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The optical spectra obtained from the optional polarized on-axis and the off-axis Raman beams can be used to carry out a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) non-destructive orientation mapping of the surface (2D) or volume (3D) of the sample. In particular, if the sample is a crystalline or polycrystalline sample, orientation mapping of the grains can be carried out. A polycrystalline material is composed of a large number of grains, which are also called crystallites.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Instead of obtaining one or more polarized on-axis Raman beams from collected on-axis Raman beams, some embodiments can make use of only one or more polarized off-axis Raman beams obtained from only collecting off-axis Raman beams. In some embodiments, off-axis Raman beams and/or on-axis Raman beams can be collected simultaneously and the optical spectra of at least some of the corresponding polarized on-axis and/or off-axis Raman beams can be detected simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Orientation mapping can provide spatially resolved information about the position, size, morphology, and crystallographic orientation for each grain of a polycrystalline sample, as well as information about the topological connectivity between the grains can be obtained, with a diffraction-limited spatial resolution of around 200 nm. Thus, the apparatus in accordance with the present invention can also be used to obtain crystallographic information of a sample. In 3D orientation mapping, the volume has a very small thickness due to the short penetration depth of the light into the sample.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In theory, if the symmetry group of the crystal is known, Raman tensors for crystal modes can be obtained and intensities of the Raman signals versus sample rotation angle can be simulated. Correlation between theoretical and experimental angular intensity dependencies can be used for the determination of the local crystallographic orientation. Polarized Raman experiments have so far been carried out by rotating the sample or rotating a set of wave plates in the incident laser or on scattered beams in the Raman setup.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, the apparatus in accordance with the present invention allows for polarized Raman spectroscopy with simultaneous registration of Raman spectra from at least one polarized on-axis Raman beam and at least one polarized off-axis Raman beam or from only polarized off-axis Raman beams, which allows avoiding ambiguities in the determination of crystallographic orientation, for example parameterized by proper Euler angles, while the orientation of the sample is not changed. Thus, it is not required to rotate the sample.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The apparatus in accordance with the present invention can in particular be used to carry out the simultaneous registration of multiple Raman scattering spectra obtained at different polarization and an ambiguity free orientation determination data analysis that allows for 2D and 3D quantitative orientation mapping of polycrystalline materials. A sub-micrometer resolution, fast data acquisition and an orientation determination at high angular accuracy and precision can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The optical system can be configured to simultaneously collect at least one on-axis Raman beam and at least one off-axis Raman beam from Raman light scattered by the sample in response to exposing the surface to the excitation radiation. The sample scatters the light without any preferential direction. Thus, when collecting the Raman beams, for example by use of an objective of the apparatus, the on-axis beams and off-axis beams might not yet be separated from each other. The collected light might pass, for example, through a mask with pinholes that separates the at least one off-axis beam from the at least one on-axis beam. The mask might for example comprise a plate with at least two pinholes. One pinhole might be aligned with the optical axis of the optical system, while the other pinhole is offset from the optical axis in a radial direction with regard to the optical axis.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The at least one light source might provide one or more laser beams to the sample. The laser beams might be polarized on their path to the sample.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the at least one off-axis Raman beam travels&#x2014;at least for some travel distance in the optical system&#x2014;along a propagation direction in the optical system that is offset in a radial direction from the optical axis, in particular the central optical axis of the polarizer device. The central optical axis is in particular the optical axis defined by a central polarization sensitive element, which can be a Wollaston prism.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The off-axis Raman beam can travel through an optical element that acts on the off-axis Raman beam in such a way that the off-axis Raman beam travels off-axis with regard to the optical axis of the optical system, in particular the central optical axis of the polarizer device. For example, a polarization analyzer may be placed off-axis with respect to the optical axis and the off-axis Raman beam may pass through this polarization analyzer.
