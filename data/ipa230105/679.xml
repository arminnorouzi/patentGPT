There are various approaches to such surgery, including: 1) ab externo trabeculectomy or shunting, which requires cutting the conjunctiva and the sclera to penetrate the eye and provide a trans-scleral outflow path; 2) ab interno trabecular or trans-scleral outflow stenting or shunting of aqueous with hardware-based implantable devices or with ablating, non-implantable cutters such as dual-blade and trabectome; and 3) ab interno supraciliary stenting using implantable non-biological hardware implants.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current ab interno stenting devices and methods are based on non-biological hardware materials such as polyimide, polyethersulphone, titanium, poly styrene-blocks-isobutylene-block-styrene and others. There are significant drawbacks with such non-biological hardware-based implantable devices as such devices can lead to major erosion, fibrosis and ocular tissue damage such as endothelial cell loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, there is a need for improved devices and methods related to ophthalmic surgery for the treatment of glaucoma.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, described is a system for deploying an implant cut from a biological tissue into an eye of a patient including a delivery device having a proximal housing; at least one actuator; and a distal coupler.

for example only and are not meant to be to scale. It is to be understood that devices described herein may include features not necessarily depicted in each figure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Disclosed are implants, systems, and methods for increasing aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber of an eye. As will be described in detail below, ab interno outflow stenting using biological, cell-based or tissue-based materials provides biocompatible aqueous outflow enhancement with improved tolerability and safety over conventional shunts. In an example implementation, a biologic tissue or biologically-derived material is harvested or generated in vitro and formed into an implant, also referred to herein as a stent, using a cutting device, also referred to herein as a trephining device or cutting tool. In an implementation, the stent is an elongated body or material that has an internal lumen to provide a pathway for drainage. In a preferred implementation, the stent is an elongated body or strip of tissue that does not have an internal lumen and is configured to maintain the cleft and provide supraciliary stenting (or stenting within another anatomical location such as within Schlemm's Canal or trans-scleral). Lumen-based devices can be limited by the lumen acting as a tract for fibrotic occlusion. The stent formed from the tissue is then implanted into the eye via an ab interno delivery pathway to provide aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber. The stents described herein can be used as a phacoemulsification adjunct or stand-alone treatment to glaucoma as a micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) treatment.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Use of the terms like stent, implant, shunt, bio-tissue, or tissue is not intended to be limiting to any one structure or material. The structure implanted can, but need not be a material that is absorbed substantially into the eye tissue after placement in the eye such that, once absorbed, a space may remain where the structure was previously located. The structure once implanted may also remain in place for an extended period and not substantially erode or absorb.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As will be described in more detail below, the stents described herein can be made from biologically-derived material that does not cause toxic or injurious effects once implanted in a patient.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The term &#x201c;biologically-derived material&#x201d; includes naturally-occurring biological materials and synthesized biological materials and combinations thereof that are suitable for implantation into the eye. Biologically-derived material includes a material that is a natural biostructure having a biological arrangement naturally found within a mammalian subject including organs or parts of organs formed of tissues, and tissues formed of materials grouped together according to structure and function. Biologically-derived material includes tissues such as corneal, scleral, or cartilaginous tissues. Tissues considered herein can include any of a variety of tissues including muscle, epithelial, connective, and nervous tissues. Biologically-derived material includes tissue harvested from a donor or the patient, organs, parts of organs, and tissues from a subject including a piece of tissue suitable for transplant including an autograft, allograft, and xenograft material. Biologically-derived material includes naturally-occurring biological material including any material naturally found in the body of a mammal. Biologically-derived material as used herein also includes material that is engineered to have a biological arrangement similar to a natural biostructure. For example, the material can be synthesized using in vitro techniques such as by seeding a three-dimensional scaffold or matrix with appropriate cells, engineered or 3D printing material to form a bio-construct suitable for implantation. Biologically-derived material as used herein also includes material that is cell-derived including stem cell(s)-derived material. In some implementations, the biologically-derived material includes an injectable hyaluronate hydrogels or viscomaterials such as GEL-ONE Cross-linked Hyaluronate (Zimmer).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Biologically-derived materials can include naturally-occurring biological tissue including any material naturally found in the body of a mammal that is minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated according to FDA guidance under 21 CFR 1271.3(f) such that the processing of the biological tissue does not alter the relevant biological characteristics of the tissue (see Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use, www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/regulatory-considerations-human-cells-tissues-and-cellular-and-tissue-based-products-minimal).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some implementations, the biostent may be an engineered or 3D printed material formed in the shape of a tube with a lumen extending from a proximal opening to a distal opening. The tube may also be printed to incorporate a plurality of openings throughout. For example, a wall of the printed material can be designed to have a plurality of openings such that a liquid within the lumen can seep or flow outward through the wall of the tube such that the tube is sufficiently porous to ensure drainage of aqueous from the eye. The tube may be printed to have a dimension that is modified at or near the time of delivery. For example, a 3D printed material may be engineered to have a first dimension that is convenient for manipulating manually. At or near the time of delivery, the 3D printed material may be cut to a size more suitable for implantation in the eye. Where a patch of material is described as being cut or trephined into a stent prior to implantation it should be appreciated that the patch of material can be a printed material having a particular 3-dimensional shape (e.g., including tubular) and is cut into a stent by cutting to a shorter, desired length. Thus, in certain implementations, the stents described herein need not be solid and can also incorporate a lumen.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The biologically-derived material, sometimes referred to herein as bio-tissue or bio-material, that is used to form the stent can vary and can be, for example, corneal tissue, scleral tissue, cartilaginous tissue, collagenous tissue, or other firm biologic tissue. The bio-tissue can be of hydrophilic or hydrophobic nature. The bio-tissue can include or be impregnated with one or more therapeutic agents for additional treatment of an eye disease process.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The bio-stent material can be used in combination with one or more therapeutic agents such that it can be used to additionally deliver the agent to the eye. In an implementation, the bio-tissue can be embedded with slow-release pellets or soaked in a therapeutic agent for slow-release delivery to the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Non-biologic material includes synthetic materials prepared through artificial synthesis, processing, or manufacture that may be biologically compatible, but that are not cell-based or tissue-based. For example, non-biologic material includes polymers, copolymers, polymer blends, and plastics. Non-biologic material includes inorganic polymers such as silicone rubber, polysiloxanes, polysilanes, and organic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyls, polyimide, etc.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Regardless the source or type of biologically-derived material, the material can be cut or trephined into an elongated shape suitable for stenting and implantation in the eye. This cutting process of the tissue can be performed before the surgical implantation process or during the surgical implantation process. The stent(s) implanted in the eye may have a structure and/or permeability that allows for aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber when positioned within a cyclodialysis cleft.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The biologically-derived material can be minimally modified or minimally manipulated tissue for use in the eye. The minimally modified biologically-derived material does not involve the combination of the material with another article, except, for example, water, sterilizing, preserving, cryopreservatives, storage agent, and/or pharmaceutical or therapeutic agent(s), and the like. The minimally modified biologically-derived material does not have a systemic effect once implanted and is not dependent upon the metabolic activity of any living cells for its primary function. The biologically-derived material can be minimally manipulated during each step of the method of preparation and use so that the original relevant characteristics of the biologic tissue is maintained. The cut stent can be a structural tissue that physically supports or serves as a barrier or conduit, for example, by maintaining at least in part a ciliary cleft formed in the eye. The stent cut from the biologically-derived material can be minimally manipulated such as by compressing, compacting, folding, rolling, or other sort of temporary manipulation of the cut stent that once freed from the forces applying the compression or compaction allows for the material to return towards its original structure. Thus, the minimal manipulation can mechanically change the size or shape of the cut tissue temporarily while still maintaining the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to its utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement once freed from that mechanical change. As an example, the biologically-derived material can be sclera that is cut into a shape that is oversized in relation to an inner diameter of a delivery tube through which the stent is implanted. The minimal manipulation of the cut stent can include temporarily compacting the scleral material into a lumen of the delivery shaft such that after implantation in the eye, the cut stent tends to return towards its original cut size. Although the biologically-derived material is described herein in the context of being cut into a stent like implant that can maintain a cleft for outflow of aqueous, other methods are considered herein. For example, the biologically-derived material can be compressed into a plug that is then implanted in a region of the eye for another purpose such as stenting, occlusion of traumatic ruptures, over-filtering bleb, posterior wall rupture, and other indications.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The minimal structural modification of the biological tissue (e.g., scleral tissue or corneal tissue) or other bio-tissue (cross-linked or not cross-linked) for implantable intraocular use can include a longitudinal trephination into an elongate strip of tissue having a width that is less than its length, for example, that can be more than 2 mm and less than 30 mm in length, as well as between about 0.1 mm and 2.0 mm in thickness, and between about 0.1 mm and 2.0 mm in width prior to loading within a delivery shaft. As will be described in more detail herein, the cutting of the bio-tissue allows for adjustment of the width being cut and can simultaneously compress the bio-tissue to a particular, consistent thickness. The cut bio-tissue can be loaded in a manner that compresses the bio-tissue into a delivery channel for loading into a shuttle such as a nose cone assembly or cartridge as described herein. The loading assembly can include features and linkages that prevent buckling of the pusher as it transfers the bio-tissue from the loader into the shuttle. The cutting, loading, and transfer for delivery can be combined within a single assembly or can be performed by separate assemblies configured to work in conjunction with one another. One or more components of the assemblies described herein can be provided as a ready-to-use item. For example, the bio-tissue can be pre-cut and provided within a preloaded shuttle assembly that is sold as a ready-to-use component or a partially ready-to-use component that is coupled with a delivery hand piece, for example.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional views of a human eye showing the anterior chamber AC and vitreous chamber VC of the eye. A stent <b>105</b> can be positioned inside the eye in an implanted location such that at least a first portion of the stent <b>105</b> is positioned in the anterior chamber AC and a second portion of the stent <b>105</b> is positioned within tissues such as within the supraciliary space and/or suprachoroidal space of the eye. The stent <b>105</b> is sized and shaped such that the stent <b>105</b> can be positioned in such a configuration. The stent <b>105</b> provides or otherwise serves as a passageway for the flow of aqueous humor away from the anterior chamber AC (e.g. to the supraciliary space and/or suprachoroidal space). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, the stent <b>105</b> is represented schematically as an elongated body relative to a delivery shaft <b>210</b>.

Additionally, the size and shape of the stent <b>105</b> prior to insertion within the delivery shaft <b>210</b> can change upon insertion into the delivery shaft <b>210</b> and can change after deployment from the delivery shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The stent <b>105</b> can be implanted ab interno, for example, through a clear corneal incision or a scleral incision. The stent can be implanted to create an opening or cleft for augmented outflow communication between the anterior chamber AC and the supraciliary space, the anterior chamber AC and the suprachoroidal space, the anterior chamber AC and Schlemm's Canal, or the anterior chamber AC and the sub-conjunctival space, or any other ocular compartment, tissue or interface where trans-scleral, sub-scleral, or supra-scleral occlusion, stenting, and/or tissue reinforcing are clinically indicated. In a preferred implementation, the stent <b>105</b> is implanted such that a distal end is positioned within a supraciliary position and the proximal end is positioned within the anterior chamber AC to provide a supraciliary cleft. The distal end of the stent <b>105</b> can be positioned between other anatomical parts of the eye.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Conventional glaucoma stenting devices are typically formed of non-biological materials such as polyimide or other synthetic materials that can cause endothelial tissue damage leading to progressive, long-term, and irreversible corneal endothelial loss. The stent materials described herein can reduce and/or eliminate these risks of tissue damage while still providing enhanced aqueous humor outflow.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The stent <b>105</b> described herein can be formed of any of a variety of biologically-derived materials having a permeability and/or structure that allows for aqueous filtration therethrough. The stent <b>105</b> can be formed of a biologically-derived material that is harvested, engineered, grown, or otherwise manufactured. The biologically-derived stent material can be obtained or harvested from a patient or from donors. The biologically-derived stent material can be harvested before or during surgery. The biologically-derived stent material can be synthetic bio-tissue created using in vitro techniques. The biologically-derived material can be stem cell generated or bioengineered. The tissue can be generated via in situ cellular or non-cellular growth. In an example implementation, the tissue can be 3D printed during manufacture. The biologically-derived material can be minimally manipulated material and retain its original structural characteristic as a tissue.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The 3D printed tissue can be printed as a larger patch of material that is then cut at the time of surgery as described elsewhere herein. Alternatively, the 3D printed tissue can be printed to have the dimensions of the final implantable stent. In this implementation, the 3D printed material need not be cut before implantation, but can be implanted directly. For example, the 3D printed stent can be printed directly into a cartridge that is configured to operatively couple with the delivery device described herein, which is in turn used to deploy the 3D printed stent into the eye. The 3D printed stent can be generated using the 3D printing process described in <i>Biofabrication, </i>2019; 11 (3).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In an example implementation, the stent <b>105</b> is made of a bio-tissue. The biologically-derived material can be corneal tissue and/or non-corneal tissue. The biologically-derived material may include corneal, scleral, collagenous or cartilaginous tissue. In an implementation, the biologically-derived stent material can be denuded corneal stromal tissue without epithelium and endothelium that is porous and has hydrophilic permeability to allow aqueous filtration. The biologically-derived material can be minimally manipulated sclera that retains its original structural characteristic as a tissue. The biologically-derived material of the stent <b>105</b> can, but need not be incorporated into the eye's inherent anatomy after placement in the eye. The stent can cause the surrounding tissue to form a pathway that remains open for an extended period, even after absorption of the stent. The biologically-derived stent material may not significantly absorb or be incorporated into the eye's anatomy such that the stent <b>105</b> remains implanted for an extended period of time or indefinitely, as needed.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In other implementations, the stent <b>105</b> material may be manufactured of a complex carbohydrate or a collagen that is non-inflammatory. The stent <b>105</b> may also be formed of a biodegradable or bioabsorbable material including biodegradable polymers including hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polylactic glycolic acid; polysaccharides such as cellulose or cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose, cross-linked or uncross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose starch, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthallate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthallate and calcium alginate, polypropylene, polybutyrates, polycarbonate, acrylate polymers such as polymethacrylates, polyanhydrides, polyvalerates, polycaprolactones such as poly-c-caprolactone, polydimethylsiloxane, polyamides, polyvinylpyrollidone, polyvinylalcohol phthallate, waxes such as paraffin wax and white beeswax, natural oils, shellac, zein, or a mixture. The stent <b>105</b> may be formed of hyaluronate hydrogels or viscomaterials.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As mentioned, the biologically-derived stent material can have a permeability or porosity that allows for aqueous filtration for sufficient control or regulation of intraocular pressure. Permeable bio-tissues described herein (e.g. sclera, cornea, collagen, etc.) are preferred stent materials, however, any bio-tissue, even if impermeable, is considered herein as a potential stent material to serve as a structural spacer that keeps the cyclodialysis open. Preferably, the material of the stent can create a gap that allows fluid to flow. The gap created can run longitudinally along each side of the stent. If the material of the stent is permeable, more fluid can pass through the cyclodialysis than if the stent material is impermeable and the fluid is required to pass along the outside of the stent. Thus, the material considered herein need not be porous in order to provide the desired function, however, the function can be enhanced by the porosity of the material.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Generally, the biologically-derived stent material has some firmness and intraocular durability such that it can maintain outflow from the anterior chamber, however, is less stiff than conventional non-biologically-derived polyimide shunts used in the treatment of glaucoma (e.g. CYPASS, Alcon). The stent material may have a sufficient structure to serve as a spacer to prop open a sustained supraciliary outflow. The stent material can maintain its structural height or thickness once implanted within the cyclodialysis such that fluid flow through or around the stent is provided. In some implementations, the cut stent is minimally manipulated by compressing or compacting into a delivery shaft so that the size and/or shape of the cut stent is reduced from a first size into a second, smaller size within the shaft. The delivery shaft can be sized and shaped to be inserted through a cornea (such as a self-sealing incision in a cornea) into the anterior chamber and advanced towards the iridocorneal angle. The delivery shaft can deploy the compacted stent between tissue layers near the angle. Once the compacted stent is deployed from the delivery shaft it can begin to return towards its original shape and/or size. The cut stent, once implanted, can take on a shape and/or size that is smaller from its original shape and/or size or that is the same as its original shape and/or size. The minimally-modified biological tissue can be used to treat glaucoma. Biologically-derived stent material provides advantages in terms of biocompatibility, anatomic conformity, and aqueous permeability compared to conventional non-biological materials such as polyimide. Biologically-derived stent material can provide better conformability and compliance to the scleral wall and can be less likely to cause endothelial and scleral erosion/loss over time and with chronic eye rubbing and blinking.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Typically, allograft tissue for implantation into the eye is handled delicately so as not to modify it from its original state. The cut stents described herein need not be handled so delicately and instead can be minimally-modified by compressing or compacting or otherwise wedging into a smaller space for ab-interno delivery into the eye for intraocular stenting, occlusion, reinforcement through a corneal or scleral incision or puncture (less than about 3.5 mm).</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an implementation, the material used to form the stent is provided as an uncut patch of material configured to be manually loaded within a cartridge <b>200</b>. The uncut patch of material can also be cut by a cutting assembly that is independent of a cartridge <b>200</b> and then transferred into a region of a cartridge <b>200</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the cutting can be done at the time of surgery or prior to surgery. In certain implementations, the stent is formed by 3D printing and can be printed into a desired final dimension for the stent or can be printed as a patch of material that is then cut at the time of or prior to surgery. The cutting achieved by the devices described herein can provide thin strips of material that can be implanted in the eye to provide regulation of aqueous outflow. The process of cutting or trephining can position the cut implant within a conduit or lumen of the cartridge such that the cut implant held within the cartridge may be subsequently delivered from the delivery device without needing to remove or transfer the cut implant from the cartridge. Alternatively, the cutting can be performed independently of transferring the cut implant into a delivery device. The cutting and transferring of the cut implant into a delivery device can be independent steps performed by independent tools or assemblies. For example, the system can incorporate a first device that is used for cutting the patch of material into a cut implant, a second device used to transfer the cut implant into a delivery device, and a third device used to deploy the cut implant from the delivery device into the eye. It should be appreciated that the cutting, transferring, and deploying can be integrated into a single device or one or more can be independent devices used in conjunction with one another to transition a patch of material into a cut implant for deployment in an eye. In a preferred embodiment, the cutting and transferring of the cut implant are integrated into a first device and the deployment of the cut implant in an eye is in a second device.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The term &#x201c;patch of material&#x201d; as used herein refers to a piece of biologically-derived material having a size along at least one dimension that is greater than a size of the stent cut from the patch of material and implanted in the subject. In some implementations, the patch of material can have a generally square shape and the stent cut or trephined from the patch of material can have a generally rectangular shape. For example, the patch of material can be about 7 mm wide&#xd7;7 mm long&#xd7;0.55 mm thick and the stent cut from the patch of material can be 0.3&#x2212;1.0 mm wide&#xd7;7 mm long&#xd7;0.55 mm thick. The dimensions of the patch of material and the cut stent can vary. The patch of material prior to cutting can be between about 5 mm to about 10 mm wide, between about 5 mm up to about 10 mm long, and between about 0.25 mm to about 2 mm thick. The stent cut from the patch of material can be between about 0.3 mm up to about 2 mm wide, preferably between 0.7 mm to 1.0 mm wide. The stent cut from the patch of material can be between about 5 mm up to about 10 mm long. The stent cut from the patch of material can be between 0.25 mm to about 2 mm thick. The patch of material and the cut stent can each have the same length and the same thickness, but differ from one another in width. The patch of material and the stent cut from the patch of material can also have different lengths and thicknesses. For example, the patch of material can have a first thickness and the stent cut from the patch of material have the same thickness, but when implanted can be folded or rolled into a different thickness from the patch of material. The cut stent need not be rectangular in shape and can have a non-rectangular shape such as an angular wedge or any of a variety of shapes to provide a particular clinical result. For example, a stent cut to the shape of a &#x201c;dog bone&#x201d; having enlarged distal and proximal ends may provide additional fixation within the target tissues. The stent can be cut to have a narrow elongate shape on a leading end and an enlarged dimension on a trailing end to provide ease of insertion as well as at least one end providing fixation.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some implementations, the patch of material can be a relatively larger width (e.g., 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm) and the stent cut from the patch to a strip having a much smaller width (e.g., about 1.0 mm to about 1.5 mm) and the cut stent then compacted into a delivery conduit having an inner diameter of about 0.8 mm so that the width of the stent substantially fills the inner diameter. A stent can substantially fill the inner diameter of the delivery conduit even if the stent is not oversized relative to that conduit and thus, remains uncompacted. The stent can be oversized relative to the inner dimension of the conduit and be compacted into the conduit to substantially fill it. Additionally, the dimension of the cut stent can vary depending on the dimension of the conduit the stent is to be deployed through. For example, the inner diameter of the delivery conduit can be about 600 microns to about 800 microns. Thus, the stent can be cut or trephined to any of a variety of sizes depending on whether or not the stent is to be compacted into the delivery conduit and depending upon the inner dimension of that delivery conduit.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The stent cut from the patch of material can have a width, a length, and a thickness. In an implementation, the width of the stent cut from the patch of material using the cutting devices described herein can be at least 100 microns up to about 1500 microns, or between 100 microns up to 1200 microns, or between 100 microns and 900 microns, or between 300 microns and 600 microns. The stent cut from a patch of material can have a width of at least about 100 microns and a width of no more than 1500 microns, 1400 microns, 1300 microns, 1200 microns, 1100 microns, 1000 microns, 900 microns, no more than 800 microns, no more than 700 microns, no more than 600 microns, no more than 500 microns, no more than 400 microns, no more than 300 microns, or no more than 200 microns. The length of the stent cut from a patch of material can vary depending on the location of stent implantation. In some implementations, the stent has a length that is between 1 mm and 10 mm, or more preferably between 3 mm and 8 mm long. The thickness of the stent cut from the patch of material can be from 100 microns up to about 800 microns, or from 150 microns up to about 600 microns. In an implementation, the biological material forming the stent can have a thickness that is no smaller than 100 microns and no larger than 5 mm. The thickness of the stent can also depend on whether the stent is folded or rolled upon implantation such that a patch of material having a thickness of just 250 microns can cut into a stent and the stent folded at implantation to double the thickness to about 500 microns. The thickness of the stent can also depend upon what biologically-derived material is used. For example, scleral tissue or corneal tissue can often have a thickness of around 400 microns, but following harvest can shrink to about 250-300 microns. As such, a stent cut from a shrunken patch of corneal tissue may have a thickness of just 250 microns.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some implementations, which is described in more detail below, the stent cut from the patch of material is cut so as to substantially fill the conduit through which it is advanced for delivery. In other implementations, the stent can be cut into an implant that is oversized relative to a dimension of a conduit through which it is deployed. In this implementation, the stent can be cut to have a first size, which is oversized compared to the inner dimension of the delivery conduit. The oversized stent can be primed within the delivery conduit such as by compacting or compressing with a tool so that the stent when primed within the conduit takes on a second, smaller size. Upon deployment in the eye and release of the stent from the delivery conduit, the stent may achieve a third size approaching its original first size. This will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In a non-limiting example, bio-tissue stent has dimensions no smaller than 0.1 mm and no larger than 8 mm in any direction and a thickness of not smaller than 50 microns and not larger than 8 mm. In a non-limiting example, the stent is about 6 mm in length by 300-600 microns wide by 150-600 microns thick. The cutting can be no smaller than 1 mm and no larger than 8 mm in any direction. In a non-limiting example, the cut tissue has dimensions of 100-800 microns in width and 1 mm-10 mm in length. It should be appreciated that multiple stents may be delivered to one or more target locations during an implantation procedure.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show interrelated implementations of a system <b>100</b> for preparation and delivery of a biologic intraocular stent for increasing aqueous outflow and lowering of intraocular pressure.

For example, the proximal portion <b>207</b> can remain within the cutting device <b>300</b> and a removable nose cone assembly <b>274</b> comprising the nose cone <b>275</b> and the shaft <b>210</b> can be disengaged from the proximal portion <b>207</b> and engaged with the delivery instrument <b>400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">It should be appreciated that the distal portion <b>205</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> can be useful for other delivery pathways (e.g., trans-scleral delivery). Deploying the implant <b>105</b> into the eye tissue can include the implant <b>105</b> residing at least in part between a ciliary body and a sclera of the eye. The implant <b>105</b> can reside between the ciliary body and the sclera within a cyclodialysis cleft.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> (also referred to herein as an introducer tube, applicator, conduit, or delivery body) extending in a distal direction outward from the proximal portion <b>207</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> includes at least a portion that extends along a longitudinal axis A. At least another portion of the shaft <b>210</b> can be angled, curved, or flexible such that it can form a distal curve or a bend away from the longitudinal axis A. The distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft is a tangent arc to the proximal end region of the shaft <b>210</b> with radii of between 10-20 mm, preferably about 10-15 mm, or about 12 mm. In some implementations, the shaft <b>210</b> can include a flexible portion and a rigid portion such that depending on relative position of the portions results in a change in shape of the shaft. The implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> has a proximal portion that extends along the longitudinal axis A and a distal end region <b>212</b> that curves downward away from the longitudinal axis A. The distal end region <b>212</b> can include an opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> through which the stent <b>105</b> can be deployed. The opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> can be positioned within a plane that is perpendicular to a plane of the longitudinal axis A of the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. The opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> can be positioned within a plane that is at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis A of the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. The distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be beveled such that the opening <b>230</b> into the lumen <b>238</b> is elongated rather than circular and a distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> extends beyond the opening <b>230</b>. The bevel can be about 10-45 degrees, preferably about 12-16 degrees, or about 15 degrees. The distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be a pointed tip or a blunt tip that is squared off such that it does not form a point. The shape of the opening <b>230</b> can be a function of the overall cross-section of the shaft <b>210</b> at the distal end region <b>212</b> as well as the angle of the opening <b>230</b> relative to the longitudinal axis A of the distal end region <b>212</b>. For example, if the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> has a rectangular cross-section and the opening <b>230</b> is cut perpendicular relative to the longitudinal axis A, the opening <b>230</b> and the cross-sectional shape of the shaft <b>210</b> are substantially matched. If the shaft <b>210</b> has a rectangular cross-section and the open <b>230</b> is cut less than perpendicular relative to the longitudinal axis A, the opening <b>230</b> may have an elongated rectangular shape compared to the rectangular shape of the shaft <b>210</b>. The opening <b>230</b> may also have a first shape near the heel of the bevel and a second shape near the distal-most tip <b>216</b>. For example, the opening <b>230</b> near the heel of the bevel may be rounded and the opening <b>230</b> near the distal-most tip <b>216</b> may be squared-off. It should also be appreciated that the opening <b>230</b> need not be at the distal-most end of the shaft <b>210</b>. The opening <b>230</b> can be formed in a sidewall of the shaft <b>210</b> such that the stent <b>210</b> is urged out of the lumen <b>238</b> along a direction that is angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the lumen <b>230</b>. The opening <b>230</b> can be positioned in the shaft <b>210</b> relative to the cartridge <b>200</b> such that is it positioned on a forward end, a lower side, an upper side, and/or another side of the shaft <b>210</b>. The distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can have a cross-sectional shape that is circular, oval, rounded rectangle, rectangle, rounded square, square, diamond, tear drop, or other shape and the distal-most tip <b>216</b> have a tip shape that varies, including blunt tip, bullet tip, spatula tip, or pointed tip. The distal end region of the shaft <b>210</b> can have any of a variety of configurations known in the ophthalmic arts.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The shaft <b>210</b> can be used to create a cyclodialysis cleft within the supraciliary space. The distal end region of the shaft <b>210</b> can be shaped to form the cleft as well as provide a conduit for a material to be delivered into the supraciliary space of the eye. The shaft <b>210</b> can also be used to deliver a viscous material such as viscoelastic fluid or a non-viscous material such as the sclera tissue using, for example, the pusher as a plunger. For example, viscoelastic can be delivered to a region of the eye through the shaft <b>210</b> prior to, during, and/or after implantation of the stent. The corneal incision can be created with a scalpel or other tool and the shaft <b>210</b> inserted through the incision and the distal end of the shaft <b>210</b> navigated to a desired location for delivery. The distal end of the shaft <b>210</b> can include a spatula that can be used to separate tissue layers and create the cyclodialysis cleft in the supraciliary space between the sclera and ciliary body. The dimensions, surface finish, and shape of the distal end can minimize trauma. The shaft <b>210</b> can additionally include one or more markers providing user information regarding distance of insertion. A distal end region of the shaft <b>210</b> can include one or more markers for goniometric reference for how deeply the tongue of the shaft <b>210</b> has been inserted into the supraciliary space. The one or more markers can be imprinted, etched, or other sort of mark as well as the one or more fenestrations on the shaft <b>210</b>, which will be described in more detail below. The length of the shaft <b>210</b> is sufficient to allow the device to be used from a temporal or superior position.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> has a size and shape configured for ab interno delivery through a clear corneal incision to permit passage of the stent <b>105</b> out the distal end of the shaft <b>210</b>. In at least some implementations, the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> is sized to extend through an incision that is about 1 mm in length. In another implementation, the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> is sized to extend through an incision that is no greater than about 2.5 mm in length. In another implementation, the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> is sized to extend through an incision that is between 1.5 mm to 2.85 mm in length. In some implementations, the maximum outer diameter of the shaft <b>210</b> is no greater than 1.3 mm. The distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be blunt or sharp. A blunt distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> allows for dissecting between tissues of the eye without penetrating or cutting the tissues for positioning the stent <b>105</b>. For example, the distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be configured to bluntly dissect between the ciliary body CB and the sclera S (e.g., the supraciliary space) while the stent <b>105</b> remains fully encased within the shaft <b>210</b> during the blunt dissection. In an alternative implementation, the distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> has a sharp cutting configuration for dissecting application and implantation through the scleral wall into the subconjunctival space. In yet another embodiment, the distal-most tip <b>216</b> can have a cutting configuration for dissecting and implantation into the Schlemm's Canal or trans-sclerally.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The shaft <b>210</b> can be a hypotube that is no greater than about 18 G (0.050&#x2033; OD, 0.033&#x2033; ID), 20 G (0.036&#x2033; OD, 0.023&#x2033; ID), 21 G (0.032&#x2033; OD, 0.020&#x2033; ID), 22 G (0.028&#x2033; OD, 0.016&#x2033; ID), 23 G (0.025&#x2033; OD, 0.013&#x2033; ID), 25 G (0.020&#x2033; OD, 0.010&#x2033; ID), 27 G (0.016&#x2033; OD, 0.008&#x2033; ID), 30 G (0.012&#x2033; OD, 0.006&#x2033; ID), or 32 G (0.009&#x2033; OD, 0.004&#x2033; ID). In some implementations, the shaft <b>210</b> is a hypotube having an inner diameter that is less than about 0.036&#x2033; down to about 0.009&#x2033; (0.230 mm-0.900 mm). The inner diameter of the shaft <b>210</b> can be about 0.600-0.900 mm. The system can incorporate a 600 micron shaft <b>210</b> or an 800 micron shaft <b>210</b>. Other sizes for the shaft <b>210</b> are considered herein depending on particular patient conditions and clinical needs.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In preferred implementations, the stents described herein can be formed as solid strips of material without any lumen although it should be appreciated the stent may have also include a lumen. Thus, the stents are generally not deliverable over a guidewire as many conventional glaucoma shunts are. Additionally, the stents described herein can be formed of relatively soft tissue that is more fragile as typical shunts, which are formed of more rigid polymeric or metal material. Rigid shunts can be implanted such that a distal end of the shunt is used to create a blunt dissection at the interface of the tissues through which the shunt is being inserted. The stents described herein are preferably deployed using a retractable sleeved type of injector or introducer tube that once in proper anatomic position can be retracted leaving the stent more gently externalized and precisely positioned. The stents described herein can also be deployed by advancing a pusher distally to urge the stent out of the introducer tube. The distal advancement of the pusher can be a slow, incremental advancement under direct control by a user depending on degree of depression of the button or advancement of the slider. The distal advancement can be sufficient to deploy the stent from the lumen into the tissues. Where the distal advancement is preferably controlled by a user in a slow, incremental manner, the proximal retraction can be an all-or-nothing sort of actuation that is achieved by a spring-actuated mechanism. The retraction can be relatively fast, for example, if a user desires the shaft of the device to be removed quickly for any of a variety of reasons other than to deploy the stent. Retraction need not result in deployment of the stent. For example, the pusher can be withdrawn proximally relative to the stent inside the shaft prior to proximal retraction of the shaft. This can withdraw the shaft out from the cleft while the stent remains inside the lumen, if desired.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The dimensions of the shaft <b>210</b> can be selected based on the dimensions desired for the stent to be implanted. The stents <b>105</b> can have a dimension that substantially fills the inner lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> (or the inner lumen of at least a portion of the shaft <b>210</b> through which it is delivered) such that the stent may be urged distally through that portion. In some implementations, the stent substantially filling the lumen is urged distally without wrinkling or being damaged. In other implementations, the stent substantially filling the lumen is urged distally through the shaft <b>210</b> in a manner that compacts the tissue into a plug having a denser configuration than the stent when cut from the patch. The dimensional difference or gap between the width and height dimensions of the stent <b>105</b> and the inner dimensions of the conduit can be up to about 200% of the dimensions of the stent <b>105</b>. The maximum size of the conduit and the maximum size of the stent <b>105</b> are related. As an example, if the stent width is about 1 mm, the maximum dimension of the conduit can be 3 mm, which results in the total gap between the width of the stent and the outer wall of the conduit being 200% of the stent width. The gap may be less than 5-10% of the maximum dimension of the stent <b>105</b>. Generally, the smaller the gap between the stent <b>105</b> and the conduit, the better the result for advancing the stent <b>105</b> through the conduit. If the cross-sectional area of the shaft <b>210</b> is greater than 200% the cross-sectional area of the cut stent <b>105</b>, the stent <b>105</b> can buckle as it is being pushed through the shaft <b>210</b> to be implanted in the eye. The cross-sectional area of the shaft <b>210</b> and the cross-sectional area of the stent <b>105</b> are preferably substantially size-matched. The conduit can also be coated with a lubricious or low friction material (e.g., Teflon) to improve advancement of the stent <b>105</b> through the conduit during deployment.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The cross-sectional area of the shaft <b>210</b> can also be smaller than the cross-sectional area of the stent <b>105</b>. As mentioned above, the stent <b>105</b> can be cut to be oversized relative to the inner diameter of the shaft <b>210</b> so that the stent <b>105</b> is compressed, compacted, or otherwise minimally manipulated for delivery through the tube. The stent can be cut to have a first size, which is oversized compared to the inner dimension of the shaft <b>210</b>. The oversized stent can be primed within the shaft such as by compacting with a compacting tool or push rod <b>420</b> so that the stent <b>105</b> when primed within the conduit takes on a second, smaller size. Upon deployment in the eye and release of the stent <b>105</b> from the shaft <b>210</b>, the stent <b>105</b> may achieve a third size approaching its original first size. Delivery and deployment will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The shaft <b>210</b> can, but need not be fully tubular, nor does the shaft <b>210</b> need to be circular in cross-section. For example, the shaft <b>210</b> can be circular, oval, square, rectangular, or other geometry in cross-section. Additionally, the entire length of the shaft <b>210</b> need not have the same cross-sectional shape or size. For example, a proximal end of the shaft <b>210</b> can have a first shape and a distal end of the shaft <b>210</b> can have a second shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> shows the shaft <b>210</b> is rectangular in cross-section. The lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> need not be a fully enclosed channel. For example, the shaft <b>210</b> may incorporate one or more fenestrations, openings, segmental windows, or walls having one or more discontinuities such that the lumen <b>238</b> through the shaft <b>210</b> is a partially enclosed channel.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The one or more discontinuities or fenestrations in the shaft <b>210</b> can be coated with or covered by a material that allows for visual inspection of an interior of the shaft <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>C</figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>E</figref> illustrate an implementation of a nose cone assembly <b>274</b> configured to reversibly couple with a delivery device. As discussed elsewhere herein, the delivery device <b>400</b> can include a proximal housing <b>405</b>, also referred to herein as a handle or handpiece, and at least one actuator <b>415</b>. The delivery device <b>400</b> can also include a distal coupler <b>413</b><i>b </i>configured to reversibly couple to the nose cone assembly <b>274</b>. The nose cone assembly <b>274</b> can include a nose cone <b>275</b> having a proximal end region and a distal end region. A coupler <b>413</b><i>a </i>can be positioned on the proximal end region of the nose cone <b>275</b> that is configured to reversibly engage with the distal coupler <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the delivery device <b>400</b>. The nose cone assembly <b>274</b> can also include a tubular shaft <b>210</b> projecting from the distal end region of the nose cone <b>275</b>. The tubular distal shaft <b>210</b> can incorporate one or more fenestrations <b>276</b> covered by a material that is translucent or transparent so as to reveal a lumen <b>238</b> of the tubular shaft <b>210</b>. The one or more fenestrations <b>276</b> can form a metering system of the tubular shaft <b>210</b> configured to identify depth of insertion of the tubular shaft <b>210</b> and/or a particular dimension (i.e., length) of the implant positioned within the lumen <b>238</b>. The distal nose cone assembly <b>274</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>B-<b>17</b>C</figref> uncoupled from a delivery device <b>400</b> revealing a proximal coupler <b>413</b><i>a</i>, which can be a bayonet connection on a proximal end region of the nose cone <b>275</b>, configured to reversibly couple to the distal coupler of the delivery device <b>400</b>. The distal shaft <b>210</b> projects from a distal end region of the nose cone <b>275</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The one or more fenestrations <b>276</b> can extend through a region of the distal shaft <b>210</b> that is covered by a clear material. The fenestrations <b>276</b> can be covered by reflowed nylon to make a continuous smooth channel that allows for visualization of the interior of the shaft <b>210</b>. The shaft <b>210</b> can include an introducer tube <b>277</b> that is at least partially encapsulated by an outer tube member <b>278</b>. The introducer tube <b>277</b> can be formed of a first material and the outer tube member <b>278</b> can be formed of a second different material. The first material can be stainless steel or Nitinol and the second material can be a polymer such as Nylon. The first material can be an opaque material and the second material can be relatively translucent or transparent. The introducer tube <b>277</b> can incorporate the one or more fenestrations <b>276</b> through its sidewall that are covered by the outer tube member <b>278</b> in a manner that allows for a user to see through the outer tube member <b>278</b> and through the introducer tube <b>277</b> to visually inspect the lumen <b>238</b> of the introducer tube <b>277</b>. The fenestrations <b>276</b> allow users to see that an implant is advancing through the introducer tube <b>277</b> upon actuation of a plunger through the introducer tube <b>277</b>. The fenestrations <b>276</b> can also allow users to assess the implant, such as a length of the implant, prior to deployment. The fenestrations <b>276</b> can be a known size or extend a known distance along the introducer tube <b>277</b> such that the length of the implant within the lumen <b>238</b> can be assessed by a user by comparing its size relative to the known dimensions of the fenestration(s) <b>276</b>. Thus, the fenestrations can form a metering system on the distal shaft useful for understanding depth of insertion and/or length of implant within the lumen. Each fenestration <b>276</b> can be about 2 mm-6 mm long. The proximal portion of the shaft <b>210</b> incorporating the fenestration(s) <b>276</b> can be between about 4 mm up to about 8 mm in length. The fenestrations <b>276</b> can extend through the side wall on either side of the shaft <b>210</b> so that a user can inspect the lumen <b>238</b> from different orientations. The shape and size of the fenestrations <b>276</b> can vary. In some implementation, the fenestrations <b>276</b> are rectangular as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, but they can be any of a variety of geometric shapes. The material of the outer tube member <b>278</b> can fill the fenestrations <b>276</b> of the introducer tube <b>277</b> to maintain a smooth and continuous tubular inner diameter. This prevents the implant within the lumen <b>238</b> of the introducer tube <b>277</b> from getting jammed or prevented from sliding through the lumen <b>238</b> towards the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Again with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>C</figref>, the shaft <b>210</b> can include a proximal portion that extends along a longitudinal axis A and a distal end region <b>212</b> distal to the fenestrations <b>276</b> that curves or bends away from the longitudinal axis A. The distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft is a tangent arc to the proximal end region of the shaft <b>210</b> with radii of between 10-20 mm, preferably about 10-15 mm, preferably about 12 mm. The curved distal end region <b>212</b> can be incorporated in a shaft <b>210</b> with or without the fenestrations <b>276</b>. The fenestrations <b>276</b> can be located along the substantially straight proximal portion of the shaft <b>210</b> proximal to the curve or bend. A distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be translucent or transparent and/or incorporate another window into the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. In an implementation, the introducer tube <b>277</b> terminates distal of the curve or bend of the shaft <b>210</b> and the outer tube member <b>278</b> extends past the terminal end of the introducer tube <b>277</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref>). Thus, the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be formed solely of the outer tube member <b>278</b>. As discussed above, the outer tube member <b>278</b> can be a transparent or translucent material such as Nylon or another polymeric material allowing for visual inspection of the shaft lumen <b>238</b>. The clear distal end region <b>212</b> can be similarly smooth so as to maintain a smooth transition from the metal introducer tube <b>277</b> to the polymer distal tip. The smooth transitions prevent the implant within the lumen <b>238</b> from becoming misaligned or jammed during deployment. The distal end region <b>212</b> can curve downward from the proximal portion of the shaft <b>210</b> such that the distal opening <b>230</b> from the shaft <b>210</b> surrounds a different longitudinal axis A&#x2032; than the proximal opening <b>280</b> into the shaft <b>210</b> that can surround a first longitudinal axis A. The clear distal end region <b>212</b> can have a length that is about 5 mm or between about 3 mm up to about 7 mm. The distal opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> can be at an oblique angle to increase the size of the opening <b>230</b>, which can be about 1.5 mm up to about 2 mm. The bevel of the distal end region <b>212</b> can be between 10-45 degrees, preferably about 12-16 degrees. The distal-most end <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can form a flat face that is about 0.10 mm-0.20 mm in thickness, preferably about 0.15 mm in thickness. Generally, the distal-most end <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> is not designed to cut or form a puncture in the eye tissue, but rather for blunt dissection or teasing between tissues. The distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> preferably incorporates no sharp edges.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As described elsewhere herein, the shaft <b>210</b> can include an inner pusher or push rod <b>420</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>C-<b>12</b>D</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>E-<b>17</b>I</figref>). The push rod <b>420</b> can be formed of Nitinol, stainless steel, or a monofilament or a braided component. The push rod <b>420</b> can be a fully cylindrical element having no lumen that extends through the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> so as to engage against a proximal end of the stent <b>105</b>. The push rod <b>420</b> is flexible enough to translate through the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> around the curvature near the distal end region and also stiff enough to bear against the cut stent <b>105</b> within the lumen <b>238</b> to cause deployment of the stent <b>105</b> in the eye. The push rod <b>420</b> can have differences in outer diameter along its length to improve its flexibility relative to the shaft <b>210</b>, particularly where the shaft <b>210</b> has a curved distal end region <b>212</b>. As discussed above, the shaft <b>210</b> can curve near a distal end region forming a tangent arc with radii between 10-20 mm, or preferably about 12 mm. The geometry of the push rod <b>420</b> can change over its length to provide improved flexibility to accommodate this curve. In an implementation, the push rod <b>420</b> can undergo a change in outer diameter between the proximal and distal ends (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>F</figref>). A distal end region <b>440</b> of the push rod <b>420</b> can have a maximum outer diameter that is greater than an outer diameter of an intermediate region <b>442</b> of the push rod <b>420</b>. The smaller outer diameter of the intermediate region <b>442</b> of the push rod <b>420</b> is designed to navigate the curve of the distal end region <b>212</b> of the outer shaft <b>210</b>. The push rod <b>420</b> can taper between the sections so that the outer diameter of each region gradually changes towards the different outer diameter of a neighboring region. The larger outer diameter of the distal end region <b>440</b> of the push rod <b>420</b> allows for a larger surface area to abut against the cut stent within the lumen <b>238</b>. If the outer diameter of the distal tip <b>441</b> of the push rod <b>420</b> were too small, the distal tip <b>441</b> would potentially penetrate the stent <b>105</b> as opposed to providing a bearing surface against the stent <b>105</b>. The outer diameter of the distal end region <b>440</b> can be about 0.525 mm-0.575 mm and the outer diameter of the intermediate region <b>442</b> can neck down to about 0.200 mm-0.300 mm.

Once loaded with the cut stent, the cartridge <b>200</b> can be removed from the cutting device <b>300</b> or the loading device <b>600</b> so that it may be coupled with the delivery device <b>400</b>. The cartridge <b>200</b> can be positioned relative to the cutting device <b>300</b> that is configured to hold the patch of material <b>101</b> and cut it into a stent <b>105</b>.

The cutting device <b>300</b> is configured to cut or otherwise prepare the biologically-derived tissue or patch of a material <b>101</b> having a first contour or shape (e.g., a wider, square sheet or patch of material) into a second contour or shape (e.g., a narrower, rectangular strip of material) that conforms to an implantable stent <b>105</b> having the dimensions described herein. The cutting performed using the cutting devices <b>300</b> described herein can involve guillotine, punch, rotating, sliding, rolling, or pivoting blade cutting motion. In some implementations, the cutting is performed orthogonal to the plane of the patch of material. In some implementations, the cutting is performed axially along the conduit of implantation such that the axis of cutting can be aligned, within, or parallel to an implantation conduit to allow unimpeded tissue loading and transfer for implantation without manipulating, tearing, or damaging the fragile stent tissue.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">As mentioned above, the cutting process is preceded by a tissue fixation step wherein the biologically-derived tissue that forms the stent is firmly fixed between two appositional planar surfaces to ensure the tissue is not wrinkled or malformed and the subsequent cut is of accurate dimensions. The fixation can optionally provide compression as well as tension or stretching of the tissue within at least one plane to ensure clean cutting through the tissue. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can hold the patch of material <b>101</b> prior to cutting or the patch of material <b>101</b> can be held within a region of the tissue cartridge <b>200</b> prior to cutting by the cutting assembly <b>500</b>. In some implementations, the cutting device <b>300</b> in combination with the cover <b>214</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> can incorporate an anterior-to-posterior capture such that the material <b>101</b> to be cut is held fixed on the z-plane preventing movement prior to engaging the tissue with the cutting member <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The cutting can be performed within a path or conduit formed within the cartridge <b>200</b>.

An upper surface of the cover <b>214</b> can extend above the upper surface of the base <b>224</b> such that the outer dimension of the proximal portion <b>207</b> is keyed. In other words, the outer dimension of the cartridge <b>200</b> is keyed and can only be inserted within the receptacle <b>306</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> in a single orientation (e.g., the cover <b>214</b> positioned on an upper side).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The cutting device <b>300</b> can additionally include a cutting assembly <b>500</b> having a cutting member <b>312</b> configured to cut the patch of material <b>101</b> within the recess <b>221</b> of the cartridge into a stent <b>105</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). The configuration of the cutting member <b>312</b> can vary. In this configuration, the cutting member <b>312</b> can include at least a first blade <b>344</b><i>a </i>and a second blade <b>344</b><i>b </i>separated a distance from the first blade <b>344</b><i>a</i>.

Actuation of the cutting member <b>312</b> causes the first and second blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>to be urged towards the patch of material <b>101</b> cutting through the thickness thereby forming the stent <b>105</b>. The blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>can have a width along the longitudinal axis A of the cartridge <b>200</b> sufficient to cut a full length of the patch of material <b>101</b>. The distance between the blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>can be designed to achieve the width desired for the cut stent <b>105</b>. The blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>can be positioned parallel to one another or may be angled. The blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>may be angled relative to one another and/or angled relative to the tissue to be cut. Angling the blades improves the reproducibility of the tissue cut so that a very straight piece of tissue is formed from the patch <b>101</b> without any bulging along the sides of the new cut stent. Angling of the blades will be described in more detail below. The cutting member <b>312</b> can also include only a single blade <b>344</b> configured to trim a stent to size from the patch of material <b>101</b>. Additionally, the recess <b>221</b> to receive the patch of material <b>101</b> prior to cutting need not be within the cartridge <b>200</b>, but can be within a region of the cutting device <b>300</b>, which will be described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some implementations, the blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>can be positioned above the patch of material <b>101</b> to be cut and corresponding lower blades <b>345</b><i>a</i>, <b>345</b><i>b </i>can be positioned below the patch of material <b>101</b>. Thus, as the blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>are urged downward towards the patch of material <b>101</b>, they urge the patch of material <b>101</b> towards the lower blades <b>345</b><i>a</i>, <b>345</b><i>b </i>such that the corresponding upper and lower blades cut completely through the material <b>101</b> in two locations creating the stent <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The cutting member <b>312</b> can be actuated by a user to move the blades.

The patch of material <b>101</b> is cut by the corresponding upper and lower blades forming the stent <b>105</b>. The distance between the upper and lower blades determines the width of the stent <b>105</b> that is cut from the patch of material <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The handles <b>343</b> can open along any of a number or orientations relative to the base <b>302</b>. For example, the pivot axis P of the hinge <b>317</b> can be substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the base A. In this implementation, the hinge <b>317</b> can be positioned on a distal end of the base <b>302</b> such that the handles <b>343</b> hinge open by rotating upward and toward the distal end of the base <b>302</b>. The upper blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b </i>may be spring-loaded such that they readily return to an open configuration as the handle <b>343</b> is lifted or released.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The stent <b>105</b>, once cut, can be contained on all sides by the cartridge <b>200</b> and the cutting member <b>312</b> creating a complete enclosure or stent cutting chamber for the stent <b>105</b> within the assembly of the cutting device <b>300</b> and the cartridge <b>200</b>. For example, the floor and ceiling of the stent cutting chamber can be formed by the lower portion <b>222</b> of the cover <b>214</b> and the projection <b>271</b> of the recess <b>221</b>. The walls of the stent cutting chamber can be formed by the upper blades <b>344</b><i>a</i>, <b>344</b><i>b</i>, and the lower blades <b>345</b><i>a</i>, <b>345</b><i>b </i>of the cutting member <b>312</b>. Together, the walls of the stent cutting chamber can form a rectangle to help constrain and direct the pusher <b>320</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> that is advanced to push the stent <b>105</b> from the stent cutting chamber distally into the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. In an implementation, the stent cutting chamber can be at least partially arced or circular in cross-section. The upper and lower surfaces of the cutting chamber can be curved or non-planar. As an example, the lower portion <b>222</b> of the cover <b>214</b> can be recessed forming a concavity forming arched ceiling to the cutting chamber. The floor of the cutting chamber formed by the projection <b>271</b> may incorporate a corresponding concavity. The arched ceiling and recessed floor of the cutting chamber reduces the amount of open space created around the cut stent <b>105</b> relative to the inner walls of the shaft that could otherwise result in the push rod going off-track or allowing the cut stent <b>105</b> to divert off the desired path during deployment. Minimizing the air space within the shaft relative to the trephine stent <b>105</b> improves advancement of the stent <b>105</b> through the device. The cut stent <b>105</b>, in turn, can have a cross-sectional shape that conforms more closely to the cross-sectional shape of the delivery conduit through which the stent <b>105</b> must be advanced. The corresponding shape eliminates excess space on the upper and lower sides of the cut stent <b>105</b> relative to the conduit. This, in turn, provides better guidance for the pusher <b>320</b> to advance the cut stent <b>105</b> towards the distal end of the shaft. The stent <b>105</b> can also be cut to be oversized relative to the conduit as discussed elsewhere herein and compressed, compacted, or otherwise manipulated within the conduit prior to deployment.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The stent <b>105</b>, once cut, can be axially aligned with the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>F-<b>4</b>G</figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>H-<b>4</b>J</figref> show the cutting device <b>300</b> can include a pusher <b>320</b> configured to slide distally relative to the base <b>302</b> into a proximal end region the cartridge <b>200</b> to advance the cut stent <b>105</b> from the location of this complete enclosure along the implantation conduit into the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>.

The patch of material <b>101</b> can preferably be cut to a size that is slightly larger than the size of the conduit through which it is delivered so that the stent <b>105</b> is compressed and packed within the conduit so that it may be more easily advanced through the lumen <b>238</b>. The cutting can be performed as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref>. The cutting of the patch of material and transfer into the shaft <b>210</b> can also be performed using other cutting assemblies <b>500</b> as described below and with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>H</figref>. The cutting assemblies <b>500</b> described herein can form part of the tissue cartridge <b>200</b>, the cutting device <b>300</b>, or the delivery device <b>400</b>. Preferably, the cutting assembly <b>500</b> is part of the cutting device <b>300</b>. The cutting device <b>300</b> can couple to at least a portion of the cartridge <b>200</b> such as the nose cone assembly <b>274</b> with the distal shaft <b>210</b> extending from the nose cone <b>275</b> so that the cut stent <b>105</b> can be primed within the shaft <b>210</b> for delivery using the delivery device <b>400</b>. The cartridge <b>200</b> can include a proximal portion <b>207</b> configured to hold the patch of material for cutting as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, or <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C or the removable nose cone <b>274</b> and shaft <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D, <b>10</b>A</figref> that does not include a proximal portion <b>207</b> for holding the patch of material. The loading of the stent <b>105</b> need not be performed by the cutting device <b>300</b> nor does the cutting device <b>300</b> need to engage with the cartridge <b>200</b> for loading of the cut stent into the cartridge. The cut stent <b>105</b> can be manually transferred from the cutting device <b>300</b> into a separate loading device <b>600</b> that is configured to engage with the cartridge <b>200</b> and load the cartridge with the cut stent <b>105</b>. The cartridge <b>200</b> whether configured to hold a patch of material for cutting or not can be a transferrable component that is designed to couple with a cutting assembly, primed with the cut stent, removed from the cutting assembly, and coupled with a delivery device for deployment of the cut stent in the eye.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> shows an implementation of a cutting assembly <b>500</b>. The cutting assembly can be part of a cutting device <b>300</b> configured to engage with a cartridge. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can also be a separate component of a tissue preparation system that is configured to hold the patch of material <b>101</b> and cut the patch of material <b>101</b>, but that is not configured to load the cut stent into a delivery shaft. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can cut a patch of material <b>101</b>, which can be held within the cartridge or within a region of the cutting assembly <b>500</b>. The cut stent can be transferred from the cutting assembly <b>500</b> into a distal shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> for delivery through the shaft into an eye. The cut stent can be transferred, for example manually with tweezers, from the cutting assembly <b>500</b> into a loading system configured to load the cut stent into the distal shaft <b>210</b>. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can incorporate a cutting die <b>511</b> positioned relative to a slot <b>507</b> in a base <b>509</b> and a movable member <b>505</b> having planar bearing surface <b>513</b> coupled to the base <b>509</b>. The movable member <b>505</b> can be swiveled 90 degrees relative to the base <b>509</b> from a first position to a second position. When the movable member <b>505</b> is swiveled to its second position the patch of material <b>101</b> can be placed against the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The cutting die <b>511</b> can compress the patch of material <b>101</b> against the bearing surface <b>513</b>. Advancing the cutting die <b>511</b> towards the bearing surface <b>513</b> can cut through the patch of material <b>101</b> (e.g., in one or two locations as described elsewhere herein). The excess tissue can be removed from the bearing surface <b>513</b> and the movable member <b>505</b> still holding the cut stent <b>105</b> on its bearing surface <b>513</b> swiveled back towards the first position. This arranges the cut stent <b>105</b> on the bearing surface <b>513</b> within the path of the slot <b>507</b> so that a compacting tool <b>517</b> or other member can load the cut stent <b>105</b> into the slot <b>507</b>. The slot <b>507</b> can have a terminal region <b>508</b> that aligns with a longitudinal axis A of the distal shaft <b>210</b> when the cartridge <b>200</b> is coupled to the cutting device <b>300</b>. The cut stent <b>105</b> can be urged by the compacting tool <b>517</b> at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>210</b>, for example, orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>210</b>. The terminal region <b>508</b> can have a cross-sectional shape that is rounded similar to a cross-sectional shape of the distal shaft <b>210</b>. The cut stent <b>105</b> positioned within the terminal region <b>508</b> can then be urged into the lumen of the distal shaft <b>210</b> so that it is primed for delivery. The size of the slot <b>507</b> and/or the terminal region <b>508</b> can be smaller than the size of the cut stent <b>105</b> so that advancement of the compacting tool <b>517</b> urging the cut stent <b>105</b> into the slot <b>507</b> causes the stent <b>105</b> to be compressed and compacted into a plug. Once the cut stent <b>105</b> is positioned within the distal shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b>, the cartridge <b>200</b> can be removed from the cutting device <b>300</b> and transferred to a delivery device <b>400</b> for deployment in the eye. The cutting, transferring, loading, and priming can be incorporated into a single assembly or into separate components configured to work in conjunction with one another.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> shows an interrelated implementation of a cutting assembly <b>500</b> for cutting the patch of material <b>101</b> and transferring the cut stent <b>105</b> for delivery. As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, the cutting assembly <b>500</b> can be part of a cutting device <b>300</b> configured to engage with a cartridge. The patch of material can be held within a region of the cartridge for cutting or can be held by a portion of the cutting assembly <b>500</b>. The cutting die <b>511</b> can insert through a movable element <b>515</b> referred to herein as a door, pad, or other component to cut the patch of material <b>101</b>. The pad <b>515</b> can be configured to hold, apply pressure, and/or compress the tissue below it. The patch of material <b>101</b> can be positioned against a bearing surface <b>513</b>. The bearing surface <b>513</b> need not be part of a movable member as in the prior implementation, but can be at least a portion of the base <b>509</b>. The patch of material <b>101</b> can be compressed between the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>509</b> and the pad <b>515</b>. The cutting die <b>511</b> can be advanced through the pad <b>515</b> so that blade(s) of the cutting die <b>511</b> slice through the patch of material <b>101</b>. If the cutting die <b>511</b> has two blades (for example, two blades as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>E, <b>14</b>F-<b>1</b></figref> and also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>E-<b>18</b>G, <b>22</b>A, and <b>23</b>C</figref>), the cutting die <b>511</b> slices through the patch <b>101</b> in two locations. If the cutting die <b>511</b> has a single blade, the cutting die <b>511</b> slices through the patch <b>101</b> at a single location. In the case of two blades, the blades can be positioned parallel to one another or may be angled. Angling the blades improves the reproducibility of the tissue cut so that a very straight piece of tissue is formed from the patch <b>101</b> without any bulging along the sides of the new cut stent. Angling of the blades will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">After the patch of material <b>101</b> is cut the excess tissue can be removed and pressure applied by the pad <b>515</b> released. The cutting die <b>511</b> can include a spring <b>516</b> so that it returns to its initial position and the pad <b>515</b> and cutting die <b>511</b> no longer apply a pressure against the cut stent <b>105</b>. The cut stent <b>105</b> can be positioned relative to a slot <b>507</b> in the base <b>509</b> so that the compacting tool <b>517</b> can urge the cut stent <b>105</b> through the slot <b>507</b> toward the terminal region <b>508</b>. The positioning of the stent <b>105</b> can be performed manually by a user such as with tweezers or with a tool that is part of the cutting/loading system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> illustrates the cut stent <b>105</b> being loaded into the conduit from the side or orthogonal to the axis of the shaft <b>210</b>. As discussed elsewhere, the cut stent <b>105</b> can be oversized relative to the size of the slot <b>507</b> so that urging the stent into the conduit compresses and compacts the stent <b>105</b> for delivery. The slot <b>507</b> can have a terminal region <b>508</b> that aligns with a longitudinal axis A of the distal shaft <b>210</b> when the cartridge is coupled to the cutting device <b>300</b>. The cut stent <b>105</b> positioned within the terminal region <b>508</b> can then be urged into the distal shaft <b>210</b> so that it is primed for delivery. The cut stent <b>105</b> can be positioned within the terminal region <b>508</b> by urging the stent in a first direction (e.g., laterally relative to the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>210</b>) and then positioned within the distal shaft by urging the cut stent <b>105</b> in a second direction (e.g., along the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>210</b>). The cartridge, now containing the cut stent <b>105</b>, can be removed from the cutting device <b>300</b> and transferred to a delivery device <b>400</b> for deployment in the eye.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref> shows an interrelated implementation of a cutting assembly <b>500</b> for cutting the patch of material <b>101</b> and transferring the cut stent <b>105</b> for delivery. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can additionally incorporate a movable stop <b>520</b> positioned between the patch of material <b>101</b> and the slot <b>507</b> through which the cut stent <b>105</b> is to be advanced. The pad <b>515</b> and cutting die <b>511</b> can compress the patch of material <b>101</b> against a bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>509</b>.

The cutting die <b>511</b> can include a single blade (or two blades) and be advanced through the compressed patch of material <b>101</b> to cut the patch in a single location creating a stent <b>105</b>. The cutting die <b>511</b>, pad <b>515</b>, and movable stop <b>520</b> can be withdrawn away from the cut stent <b>105</b> so that the compacting tool <b>517</b> can urge the cut stent <b>105</b> distally into the slot <b>507</b> for delivery.

The longitudinal axis A of the distal shaft <b>210</b> of the nose cone assembly <b>274</b> can be aligned with the terminal region <b>508</b> of the slot <b>507</b> so that the compacting tool <b>517</b> can urge the cut stent <b>105</b> into the shaft <b>210</b>. Once the cut stent <b>105</b> is compacted into the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> the nose cone assembly <b>274</b> can be removed from its association with the cutting assembly <b>500</b> and transferred to a delivery device <b>400</b> for deployment in the eye.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The position of the movable stop <b>520</b> relative to the cutting blade of the die <b>511</b> can be adjusted to achieve different stent widths. For example, the movable stop <b>520</b> can be moved toward the single blade of the cutting die <b>511</b> to decrease the width of the stent and moved away from the cutting die <b>511</b> to increase the width of the stent. The location of the movable stop <b>520</b> relative to the cutting die <b>511</b> can be selected by a user, for example, via a dial or other user interface that allows for incremental adjustments. The dial range can be between about 0.6 mm and about 1.9 mm and can include markings that are laid out per a &#xbc; to 1/16 thread. The cutting die <b>511</b> of the cutting assembly <b>500</b> can be attached to a lever, handle, or other actuator <b>343</b> as described elsewhere herein, to advance the single blade through the patch of material <b>101</b> held against the bearing surface <b>513</b> by the pad <b>515</b> upon selection of the width. In an implementation, the bearing surface <b>513</b> can be a soft plastic material (e.g., 1/16&#x2033; 90 A silicone).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref> illustrate a trephination or cutting device <b>300</b> having a cutting assembly <b>500</b>.

For example, the actuator <b>543</b> is configured to raise and lower a cutting die <b>511</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>509</b>. The actuator <b>543</b> configuration can vary as described herein including a lever or scissoring handles.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In other implementations, the actuator <b>543</b> is a lever configured to be raised and lowered to engage with a cutting die <b>511</b> that lies above the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>509</b>.

In some implementations, the upper surface of the cutting die <b>511</b> can form a button configured to be directly manually actuated to cut the stent. The bearing surface <b>513</b> is preferably a planar surface configured to hold the patch of material flat for cutting. The bearing surface <b>513</b> can be a recess <b>544</b> within the base <b>509</b> sized to hold a patch of material (not shown). The bearing surface <b>513</b> can be movable relative to the base <b>509</b> to expose the recess <b>544</b> for positioning the patch of material <b>101</b> within the recess <b>544</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some implementations, the cutting die <b>511</b> includes a single blade that is movable to select a size of the stent being cut. The cutting device <b>300</b> can incorporate an actuator <b>545</b> such as a dial, button, slider, switch, or other type of actuator configured to adjust the position of the die <b>511</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>513</b> as discussed above. The actuator <b>545</b> can move the base <b>509</b> side-to-side via a threaded screw or other mechanism to change the position of the patch of material <b>101</b> on the bearing surface <b>513</b>, such as held within the recess <b>544</b>, relative to the cutting die <b>511</b> and thereby modify the width of the stent cut from the patch. Alternatively, the actuator <b>545</b> can move the die <b>511</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>513</b> to change the width of the stent. The cutting device <b>300</b> can incorporate a stage <b>546</b> configured to be movable relative to the base <b>509</b> such as by sliding, swiveling, or lifting away from the base <b>509</b>. In some implementations, the stage <b>546</b> can slide within a single plane relative to the underlying base <b>509</b> while remaining connected to the base <b>509</b> at least in part. Alternatively, the stage <b>546</b> can be removed entirely from the base <b>509</b>. Moving the stage <b>546</b> relative to the base <b>509</b> can reveal the recess <b>544</b> out from under the area of the device where the cutting die <b>511</b> and actuator <b>543</b> are located. This allows for loading of a patch on the bearing surface without the components of the cutting assembly <b>500</b> obstructing a user's view or blocking access physically. The cutting device <b>300</b> can be a solo cutter and need not incorporate a compression or holding mechanism or a transferring mechanism. Rather, the cut stent <b>105</b> following cutting with the cutting assembly <b>500</b> can be manually transferred to another tool for priming the cut stent <b>105</b> for deployment through a shaft. The cutting device <b>300</b> can be a micro-trephination device for minimal modification of a biologically-derived tissue. The device <b>300</b> is configured to cut the biologically-derived tissue in an elongated strip of tissue having a length that is greater than the width. The width can be less than about 3 mm and the length can be greater than about 3 mm. The biologically-derived tissue can be any of a variety of tissues described herein including scleral tissue or corneal tissue harvested from a donor the patient receiving the strip of tissue as an implant. The cutting die <b>511</b> can include a single sharpened edge to trim a larger portion of the biotissue to a desired width. The sharpened edge of the die <b>511</b> can be substantially straight such that the die <b>511</b> can cut a length of the tissue. The cutting die <b>511</b> can alternatively incorporate two sharpened edges that lie parallel to one another that are separated a corresponding width apart to achieve the width desired for the stent.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The cutting die <b>511</b> can include a single blade having a sharpened edge or two blades each with sharpened edges. The sharpened edges can be formed by a single distal bevel or by dual distal bevels. The two blades can be spaced apart from one another in a precise manner in order to cut the patch of material in a single cutting actuation of the cutting die <b>511</b>. The two blades can be spaced parallel to one another. In a preferred implementation (as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>B-<b>22</b>C</figref>), the blades can be mounted at an angle to one another that accommodates for the angle of the distal bevel to ensure the inside spacing between the blades formed by the distal bevel is parallel to one another and orthogonal to the bearing surface. The various embodiments of the cutter described herein can include two blades that are angularly positioned in this manner. Where the cutter is described as having a single blade, the cutter can also include dual blades spaced a distance apart.

The actuator <b>343</b> is configured to actuate the cutting assembly <b>500</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> to cut the patch <b>101</b> into a stent <b>105</b>. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can include a cutting die <b>511</b> attached to at least one blade <b>547</b> and a pad <b>515</b> movably coupled to the base <b>302</b>. The cutting die <b>515</b> is movable relative to the pad <b>515</b> so that the blade(s) <b>547</b> can move between a retracted and extended position. The blade(s) <b>547</b> remains enclosed within the pad <b>515</b> when in the retracted position. The blade <b>547</b> penetrates a hole <b>527</b> in the pad <b>515</b> and extends through to the lower surface of the pad <b>515</b> when in the extended position. The base <b>302</b> can include a bearing surface <b>513</b> positioned below the location of the hole <b>527</b> so that the blade(s) <b>547</b> is urged against the bearing surface <b>513</b> upon actuation of the cutting die <b>511</b>. The bearing surface <b>513</b> can be located within a recessed region of the base <b>302</b>, the recessed region having a shape and size configured to receive the patch of material <b>101</b> to be cut into a stent by the blade(s) <b>547</b>. The recessed region of the base <b>302</b> can be positioned relative to the hole <b>527</b> so that a desired stent width is achieved when cutting the patch with the blade(s) <b>547</b>. A region of the recessed bearing surface <b>513</b> can extend beyond an edge of the hole <b>527</b> by a distance that is equal to a desired width for the cut stent. A user can place the patch of material within the recessed region so that an edge of the material abuts against the far end of the recessed region so that upon extension of the blade(s) <b>547</b> through the hole <b>527</b> and against the bearing surface <b>513</b> the patch is cut into the desired width. The region of the base <b>302</b> that holds the patch need not be recessed, but is preferably planar so that the patch of material <b>101</b> sits relatively flush to the base <b>302</b> and substantially orthogonal to the blades during cutting.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The pad <b>515</b>, which may be referred to as a door, pressure pad, or compression element, can be coupled to the base <b>302</b> so that it articulates between an open configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>C-<b>18</b>D</figref> and a closed configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>B</figref>. The open configuration reveals the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>302</b> so that the tissue patch <b>101</b> may be positioned against it. The pad <b>515</b> can be articulated to the closed configuration over the tissue patch <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>E</figref> illustrates the patch <b>101</b> positioned against the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>302</b> under the hole <b>527</b> in the pad <b>515</b> with an edge of the patch <b>101</b> up against an end of the recessed region. The blade(s) <b>547</b> of the cutting die <b>511</b> is in a retracted configuration. One or more leaf spring(s) <b>516</b> can urge the cutting die <b>511</b> upward away from the base <b>302</b> so that the blade(s) <b>547</b> retracts inside the pad <b>515</b>. The handle <b>343</b>, which is an open configuration to load the patch <b>101</b>, can be articulated to the closed configuration over the cutting die <b>511</b>. Articulation of the handle <b>343</b> so that its lower surface presses against the upper surface of the cutting die <b>511</b> urges the cutting die <b>511</b> downward and compresses the springs <b>516</b>. The pad <b>515</b> can fix and compress the patch <b>101</b> against the bearing surface <b>513</b> prior to actuating the blade(s) <b>547</b> of the cutting assembly <b>500</b>. The handle <b>343</b> can additionally apply compression on the patch <b>101</b> urging it against the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The blade(s) <b>547</b> of the cutting die <b>511</b> travels through the hole <b>527</b> and penetrates the patch <b>101</b> to form the cut stent. Upon release of the handle <b>343</b>, the springs <b>516</b> urge the cutting die <b>511</b> upward so the blade(s) <b>547</b> is moved away from the bearing surface <b>513</b> back into the hole <b>527</b> of the pad <b>515</b>. The handle <b>343</b> can be articulated to an open configuration and the pad <b>515</b> articulated to an open configuration revealing the cut stent within the recessed region of the base <b>302</b>. The cut stent can be transferred manually to a loading device <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">As mentioned, the cutting die <b>511</b> can include a pair of blades <b>547</b>. The blades <b>547</b> can be spaced apart from one another in a precise manner in order to cut the patch of material <b>101</b> in a single cutting actuation of the lever <b>343</b>. The blades <b>547</b> can be spaced parallel to one another. In a preferred implementation, the blades <b>547</b> are mounted at an angle to one another. The angle between the blades <b>547</b> accommodates for the angle of the bevel at the distal cutting edge of the blades <b>547</b> ensuring the inside space between the blades <b>547</b> (at least the portion of the blades <b>547</b> that penetrate the tissue) is parallel and straight faced.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Each blade <b>547</b> includes a sharp, distal cutting edge formed by at least one distal bevel. The two blades <b>547</b> are mounted at an angle relative to one another so that the inner faces are non-parallel and the distal bevels are parallel to one another. As described in more detail below, the distal bevels of the blades <b>547</b>, despite the inner faces of the blades <b>547</b> themselves being non-parallel, are parallel to one another and substantially orthogonal to the planar surface of the bearing surface and thus, the patch of tissue being cut.

The actuator <b>343</b> can be a lever configured to rotate around a pivot axis of a hinge <b>317</b>. The actuator <b>343</b> is configured to actuate the cutting assembly <b>500</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> to cut the patch <b>101</b> into a stent <b>105</b>. The cutting assembly <b>500</b> can include the cutting die <b>511</b> attached to at least one, and preferably two blades <b>547</b>. The cutting die <b>511</b> and blades <b>547</b> can be coupled to a pad <b>515</b> that is movably coupled to the base <b>302</b> around hinge <b>317</b>. In some configurations, the cutting die <b>511</b> and attached blades <b>547</b> are movable relative to the pad <b>515</b>. In other configurations, the cutting die <b>511</b> and attached blades <b>547</b> are fixed relative to the pad <b>515</b> so as to move together with the pad <b>515</b> around the hinge <b>317</b>. The blades <b>547</b> can, but need not be fully enclosed within the pad <b>515</b> prior to actuation of cutting. The blades <b>547</b> can extend through the lower surface of the pad <b>515</b> (either via actuation or simply by being fixed relative to the pad <b>515</b> in that manner) so that the blades <b>547</b> can be urged against the bearing surface (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>G-<b>18</b>H</figref>) upon actuation of the cutting die <b>511</b>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The bearing surface <b>513</b>, which is sized and shaped to receive the patch of material <b>101</b> to be cut into a stent by the blades <b>547</b>, can be located within a recessed region <b>544</b> of the base <b>302</b>. The bearing surface <b>513</b> and be a removable planar element configured to be affixed to the base <b>302</b> relative to the blades <b>547</b> for supporting the patch of material <b>101</b>. The coupling of the bearing surface <b>513</b> to the base <b>302</b> can be reversible such that the bearing surface <b>513</b> can be replaced over time, if desired, without needing to dispose of the entire cutting. The bearing surface <b>513</b> can be coupled to the base <b>302</b>, such as by one or more fixators like a screw. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>G-<b>18</b>H</figref> illustrates two bores <b>541</b> located near the recessed region <b>544</b> of the base <b>302</b> that are sized to receive screws <b>549</b> that affix the bearing surface relative to the base <b>302</b>. Other mechanisms to ensure the bearing surface <b>513</b> remains in place within the base <b>302</b> are considered as well including a tool-less snap fit or interference fit between the removable bearing surface <b>513</b> and the base <b>302</b>. The planar bearing surface <b>513</b> is preferably positioned orthogonal to the sharpened edges of the blades <b>547</b> during use, as will be described in more detail below. The blades <b>547</b> can also be removably attached to the pad <b>515</b> so that they may be replaced, if desired, if the cutting edges of the blades <b>547</b> have become dull.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The pad <b>515</b> is coupled to the base <b>302</b> so that it articulates around hinge <b>317</b> between an open configuration and a closed configuration as described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>E</figref>. The open configuration reveals the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>302</b> so that the patch <b>101</b> may be positioned within the cutting device <b>300</b> against the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The pad <b>515</b> can be articulated to the closed configuration such that the blades <b>547</b> are located over the patch <b>101</b>. In some implementations, closing the pad <b>515</b> relative to the base <b>302</b> can hold (with or without compression or pressure) the patch <b>101</b> within the cutter <b>300</b> until actuation of the lever <b>343</b> relative to the pad <b>515</b> causes the blades <b>547</b> to cut through the patch <b>101</b>. A return spring <b>516</b> can urge the lever <b>343</b> and the cutting die <b>511</b> with the attached blades <b>547</b> upward away from the bearing surface <b>513</b> of the base <b>302</b>. The return spring <b>516</b> thus retracts the blades <b>547</b> slightly relative to the pad <b>515</b>. The lever <b>343</b> can be moved around the pivot axis of hinge <b>317</b> to close the pad <b>515</b> relative to the base <b>302</b>. The lever <b>343</b> may also be moved around its own pivot axis of a second hinge <b>318</b> so as to move relative to the pad <b>515</b>. This articulation relative to the pad <b>515</b> causes complete cutting of the patch <b>101</b> by the blades <b>547</b> because the blades <b>547</b> are urged fully against the bearing surface <b>513</b>. Thus, the pad <b>515</b> can act to close the cutting device <b>300</b> and fix the patch relative to the base <b>302</b> prior to actual cutting, which can occur upon further actuation of the lever <b>343</b> relative to the pad <b>515</b> around axis <b>318</b>. The blades <b>547</b> of the cutting die <b>511</b> may travel further downward relative to the bearing surface <b>513</b> to form the cut stent from the patch <b>101</b>. Upon release of the lever <b>343</b>, the springs <b>516</b> urge the cutting die <b>511</b> upward so that the blades <b>547</b> are moved away from the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The lever <b>343</b> can be articulated around axis <b>317</b> back to an open configuration opening the pad <b>515</b> revealing the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The cut stent can be transferred manually to a loading device such as those described herein.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In other implementations, the blades <b>547</b> are fixed relative to the pad <b>515</b> so that merely closing the pad <b>515</b> relative to the base <b>302</b> causes the cutting edges of the blades <b>547</b> to penetrate and cut the patch <b>101</b>. A user can actuate the cutting device <b>300</b> using the lever <b>343</b>. The pad <b>515</b> can be rotated around the pivot axis of hinge <b>317</b> by the lever <b>343</b> to close the pad <b>515</b> relative to the base <b>302</b>. The lever <b>343</b> can be movable relative to the pad <b>515</b> to rotate around the pivot axis of the second hinge <b>318</b>. This motion compresses the return spring <b>516</b> and applies an amount of cutting pressure against the pad <b>515</b> urging it toward the tissue on the bearing surface <b>513</b>. The return spring <b>516</b> in this configuration provides a tactile feel to a user that prevents a user from squeezing the pad <b>515</b> closed too tightly against the bearing surface <b>513</b> and causing damage to the cutting edges of the blades <b>547</b>. Motion of the lever <b>343</b> relative to the pad <b>515</b> provides the user with some feedback that they have reached the end of travel of the pad <b>515</b> to prevent inadvertent damage to the blades <b>547</b> during cutting.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The blades <b>547</b> can be mounted at an angle relative to one another to accommodate for the angle of the bevel of the distal cutting edges.

The two blades <b>712</b> allow a user to cut a patch of material <b>101</b> at two locations of a patch of material <b>101</b> in a single actuation to form the stent <b>105</b>. The blade cartridge <b>710</b> can include an upper component or jaw <b>714</b> and a lower component jaw <b>716</b>. The upper jaw <b>714</b> can include the blades <b>712</b> and the lower jaw <b>716</b> can include the bearing surface <b>715</b>. The bearing surface <b>715</b> is a planar surface sized to hold the patch of material <b>101</b> in a flat orientation relative to the blades <b>712</b> so that it may be cut upon actuation. Use of the relative positional terms, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; are for purposes of clarity in orientation of the components relative to one another and are not intended to be limiting.

The cutting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>B</figref> also has an actuator configured to cause the blades to cut the patch. In this implementation, actuation is achieved using scissoring handles <b>705</b> that are reversibly coupled to the blade cartridge <b>710</b>. For example, the handles <b>705</b> can include first and second handle portions coupled together by a hinge in a scissoring arrangement. The scissor design of the handles <b>705</b> opens the blade cartridge <b>710</b> attached to the handles <b>705</b> upon spreading the handles <b>705</b> apart and closes the blade cartridge <b>710</b> upon returning the handles <b>705</b> to a closed configuration.

This allows for the patch of material <b>101</b> to be placed on the bearing surface <b>715</b> prior to cutting. Closing the blade cartridge <b>710</b> after positioning the patch of material <b>101</b> on the bearing surface <b>715</b> causes the upper jaw <b>714</b> to approach the lower jaw <b>716</b> of the blade cartridge <b>710</b> until the blades <b>712</b> penetrate the patch of material <b>101</b> on the bearing surface <b>715</b>.

Each blade <b>712</b> includes a sharp, distal cutting edge <b>720</b> formed by at least one distal bevel. The two blades <b>712</b> are mounted at an angle relative to one another so that the inner faces are non-parallel and the distal bevels are parallel to one another. As described in more detail below, the distal bevels of the blades <b>712</b>, despite the inner faces of the blades <b>712</b> themselves being non-parallel, are parallel to one another and substantially orthogonal to the planar surface of the bearing surface <b>715</b> and thus, the patch of tissue being cut.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">At least the inner face, or both the inner and outer faces, of each blade <b>712</b> can be beveled to form the distal cutting edge <b>720</b>. The inner face <b>722</b> of the blades <b>712</b> can be ground to achieve a first cutting surface <b>724</b> having a first cutting angle A<b>1</b>. The outer face <b>723</b> of the blades <b>712</b> can be ground to achieve a second cutting surface <b>725</b> having a second cutting angle A<b>2</b>. The first cutting angle A<b>1</b> can be smaller than the second cutting angle A<b>2</b>. The cutting angle A<b>1</b> of the first cutting surfaces <b>724</b> allow for the first cutting surface <b>724</b> of the first blade <b>712</b><i>a </i>to be arranged parallel to the first cutting surface <b>724</b> of the second blade <b>712</b><i>b </i>when the inner faces <b>722</b> of the blades <b>712</b><i>a</i>, <b>712</b><i>b </i>are positioned at an angle <b>4</b> relative to one another, for example, using a spacer <b>726</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>). In other words, the non-parallel angle <b>4</b> of the blades <b>712</b><i>a</i>, <b>712</b><i>b </i>relative to one another ensures the cutting surfaces <b>724</b> of the inner faces <b>722</b> of the blades <b>712</b><i>a</i>, <b>712</b><i>b </i>are parallel to one another and also arranged orthogonal to the bearing surface <b>715</b> and thus, the tissue being cut that lies against the bearing surface <b>715</b>. The spacer <b>726</b> can position and distance of the blade(s) <b>712</b> to be within a very tight tolerance (e.g., +/&#x2212;0.1 mm) in order to aid not only in achieving a very consistent and very straight stent <b>105</b> from the patch of material <b>101</b>, but also to aid in loading the cut stent into the cannula for delivery as is described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">The angling of the blades so the bevels are parallel to one another and orthogonal to the bearing surface <b>715</b> prevents the patch of material <b>101</b> lying on the bearing surface <b>715</b> from being &#x201c;squished&#x201d; inward during cutting. Eliminating the &#x201c;squish&#x201d; cuts the patch with a more consistent cross-section and with increased performance of the cutting. The blades can cut more varied thicknesses of tissue and with less damage to the tissue itself as the blades penetrate the tissue. Although the blades are shown having dual bevel cutting edge (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>E</figref>), the blade cartridge may also include single bevel blades mounted parallel and flat to one another (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>D</figref>).

The spring <b>730</b> acts in to move the cut stent <b>105</b> out from between the blades <b>712</b>. The spring <b>730</b> in a sprung configuration projects between the distal-most tips of the blades (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>). This pushes any tissue located between the blades <b>712</b> downward such that upon opening the blade cartridge <b>710</b> by spreading the handles <b>705</b> the tissue is urged towards the bearing surface <b>715</b> of the lower jaw <b>716</b> rather than between the blades <b>712</b> in the upper jaw <b>714</b>. The spring <b>720</b> is flexible enough to be compressed upward between the blades <b>712</b> during cutting motion towards the bearing surface <b>715</b> without impacting the cutting motion of the trephining device <b>700</b>.

The plow <b>622</b> can be moved forward along the base <b>602</b> and relative to the stent <b>105</b> positioned at the mark <b>621</b> to urge the stent <b>105</b> into alignment with the lumen <b>238</b> of the distal shaft <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>B</figref> are cross-sectional schematics illustrating the bidirectional movement of the plow <b>622</b> relative to the base <b>602</b> in order to align the cut stent <b>105</b> with the lumen of the shaft <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> shows the plow <b>622</b> in a retracted configuration so that loading mark <b>621</b> is in front of the forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b>. The cut stent <b>105</b> can be positioned at loading mark <b>621</b> in front of the forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b>. Movement of the plow <b>622</b> in the direction of arrow A urges the cut stent <b>105</b> towards a terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b>. The forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b> and the terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b> form a space that is coaxial and substantially size-matched to the lumen of the shaft (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>B</figref>). The forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b> can be curved so as to form at least a portion of a circle. The terminal region <b>623</b> opposite the forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b> can have a curvature that mirrors the curvature of the forward surface <b>624</b> so that upon placing the plow <b>622</b> near the terminal region <b>623</b> a tubular structure <b>625</b> is formed that contains the cut stent <b>105</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>). The tubular structure <b>625</b> formed when the plow <b>622</b> is urged into contact with the terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b> can have an inner diameter that is substantially the same as the inner diameter of the distal shaft. As discussed elsewhere herein, the cut stent <b>105</b> can be slightly oversized relative to the lumen of the shaft so that the cut stent <b>105</b> is compressed or compacted within the shaft. Similarly, the tubular structure <b>625</b> can compress or compact the cut stent <b>105</b> when the plow <b>622</b> is placed into contact with the terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b>. The relative curvatures of the forward surface <b>624</b> of the plow <b>622</b> and the terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b> can vary, but upon mating one with the other form a complete shape without gaps so that the stent <b>105</b> is fully contained within the tubular structure <b>625</b>. The curve of the forward surface <b>624</b> can be at least about 90 degrees of a circle up to about 170 degrees of a circle. The terminal region <b>623</b> of the base <b>602</b> can have a curve that is at least about 190 degrees up to about 270 degrees of a circle so that together with the forward surface <b>624</b> the cut stent <b>105</b> is enclosed 360 degrees. Any of a variety of curvatures are considered here so that the cut stent <b>105</b> can be urged forward from the mark <b>621</b> towards the terminal region <b>632</b> so that it is aligned coaxially with the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>210</b>.

The plow <b>622</b> can be manipulated in a first direction relative to the base <b>602</b>, such as with an actuator that is operatively coupled to the plow <b>622</b>. The pusher <b>620</b> can be manipulated in a second direction relative to the base <b>602</b>, such as with an actuator that is operatively coupled to the pusher <b>620</b>.

The pusher <b>620</b> can be moved longitudinally or along the longitudinal axis A of the shaft <b>210</b>. The plow <b>622</b> aligns the cut stent <b>105</b> with the long axis A of the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> and the pusher <b>620</b> loads the cut stent <b>105</b> within the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>.

The fixing of the tissue, cutting of the tissue, transferring of the cut stent, loading of the cut stent into the tissue cartridge can all be combined into a single system or can be separated into different devices.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The cut stent <b>105</b> that is loaded and compressed for delivery can be positioned within at least a portion of the cartridge <b>200</b>, such as within a lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>.

The compression and transfer of the cut stent <b>105</b> described above in relation to the cutting assembly <b>500</b> prepares the cut stent <b>105</b> for delivery without the cut stent <b>105</b> being removed from the cartridge <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The cartridge <b>200</b> can couple with a cutting device <b>300</b> having a cutting assembly <b>500</b> for cutting a patch of material <b>101</b> and a loading assembly for loading the cut stent into the cartridge <b>200</b>. The cartridge <b>200</b> can then be removed from engagement with the cutting device <b>300</b> so that it can be coupled to a delivery device <b>400</b>.

Upon insertion within the receptacle <b>292</b>, the projection <b>290</b> can be rotated, for example 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, relative to the receptacle <b>292</b> to fix the nose cone assembly <b>174</b> relative to the housing <b>405</b>.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">As mentioned above with respect to the cutting device <b>300</b>, the attachment mechanism <b>425</b> can be keyed such that the cartridge <b>200</b> with the cover <b>214</b> in place on the base <b>224</b> can be received within or otherwise engage the attachment mechanism <b>425</b> in a single orientation.

The attachment mechanism <b>425</b> also is dimensioned to ensure alignment of the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> with the internal mechanisms of the delivery device <b>400</b> such as the push rod <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">The attachment mechanism <b>425</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> can be a receptacle <b>412</b> having a depth sufficient to contain a length of the proximal portion <b>207</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> while the shaft <b>210</b> remains outside the receptacle <b>412</b>. A flexible hook <b>422</b> can extend into at least a portion of the receptacle <b>412</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). A distal end <b>424</b> of the hook <b>422</b> can be received within a correspondingly shaped detent <b>272</b> near a proximal end region of the tissue cartridge <b>200</b>. As the cartridge <b>200</b> slides within the receptacle <b>412</b>, the distal end <b>424</b> of the hook <b>422</b> can slide through the proximal end <b>207</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> and insert within the detent <b>272</b>.

The actuator <b>415</b> can also be manipulated by the single hand of the user such as with a thumb or finger. The configuration of the actuator <b>415</b> can vary. For example, the actuator <b>415</b> can include any of a variety of knob, button, slider, dial, or other type of actuator configured to move one or more components of the delivery device <b>400</b> as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The delivery device <b>400</b> can include a push rod <b>420</b> configured to be moved by the one or more actuators <b>415</b>.

The push rod <b>420</b> can be sized and shaped complementary to the inner dimension of the shaft <b>210</b>. For example, where the shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> has a rectangular cross-sectional shape, the push rod <b>420</b> may be rectangular in cross-section.

The push rod <b>420</b> therefore can act as a stopper thereby preventing the stent <b>105</b> from following the shaft <b>210</b> as it is retracted. The result is that the stent <b>105</b> is unsheathed from the shaft <b>210</b> and left within the tissues. In other implementations, both the cartridge <b>200</b> and the push rod <b>420</b> are movable to effect deployment of the stent from the shaft <b>210</b>.

The first and second actuators <b>415</b> can be sliders, buttons, or other configuration or combination of actuators configured to advance and retract their respective components. The first actuator <b>415</b> coupled to the push rod <b>420</b> can be withdrawn proximally such that the push rod <b>420</b> is in its most proximal position when the cartridge <b>200</b> is engaged by the attachment mechanism <b>425</b> of the delivery device <b>400</b>. The user can advance the first actuator <b>415</b> to urge the push rod <b>420</b> distally to advance the stent <b>105</b> within the lumen <b>238</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> towards the distal opening <b>230</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. After the cut stent <b>105</b> is primed into its distal position within the lumen <b>238</b>, the shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> can be used to dissect tissue of the eye until a target location is accessed. Once the shaft <b>210</b> is in position to deploy the stent <b>105</b> in the eye, the first actuator <b>415</b> coupled to the push rod <b>420</b> can be maintained in this distal position and the second actuator <b>415</b> actuated (e.g., withdrawing a slider or pushing a button) to retract the cartridge <b>200</b> a distance relative to the delivery device <b>400</b>. This relative movement of the shaft <b>210</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> to the push rod <b>420</b> deploys the stent <b>105</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> in the anatomy. The stent <b>105</b> can be deployed from the lumen <b>238</b> by advancing the push rod <b>420</b> so the stent <b>105</b> is fully externalized from the lumen <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> shows the cartridge <b>200</b> installed within the receptacle <b>412</b> of the delivery device <b>400</b> such that a space exists between the terminal end of the receptacle <b>412</b> and the proximal-most end of the cartridge <b>200</b>. The depth of this space defines the maximum distance the cartridge <b>200</b> can be retracted. The stent <b>105</b> is located near the distal opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> and the push rod <b>420</b> is advanced to its distal position such that the distal end of the push rod <b>420</b> abuts against a proximal end of the stent <b>105</b>. The distal end <b>424</b> of the hook <b>422</b> is retained within the detent <b>272</b> and the second actuator <b>415</b> is not yet actuated. A proximal end <b>426</b> of the hook <b>422</b> is coupled to a spring <b>430</b>. When the second actuator <b>415</b> is in a resting state prior to actuation, the hook <b>422</b> is urged distally into a first configuration. The spring <b>430</b> is compressed between the proximal end <b>426</b> of the hook <b>422</b> and the distal end of the spring <b>430</b> housing when the hook <b>422</b> is urged distally into the first configuration. When the second actuator <b>415</b> is actuated (e.g., pushed downward), the spring <b>430</b> is released and urges the proximal end <b>426</b> of the hook <b>422</b> towards a proximal end of the housing <b>405</b>. The hook <b>422</b> moves proximally and drags along with it the cartridge <b>200</b>, which is coupled to the hook <b>422</b> due to engagement of the distal end <b>424</b> of the hook <b>422</b> within the detent <b>272</b>. The distance the hook <b>422</b> moves proximally thus, retracts the cartridge <b>200</b> deeper into the receptacle <b>412</b>. The push rod <b>420</b> can remain stationary during cartridge <b>200</b> retraction. The relative motion between the shaft <b>210</b> and the push rod <b>420</b> deploys the stent <b>105</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>).</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">It should be appreciated that additional distal movement of the push rod <b>420</b> can be used to aid in deployment of the stent <b>105</b> from the lumen <b>238</b>.

Additionally, the shaft <b>210</b> can be used to inject a viscous material such as viscoelastic during the procedure using the push rod <b>420</b> as a plunger. The methods of implantation and delivery of the stent <b>105</b> are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref> illustrate steps in the deployment of the stent using a first actuator <b>415</b><i>a</i>, which in this case can be a slider, of the delivery device <b>400</b> to move the pusher from a first loading position (fully retracted) to a second primed position (at least partially advanced). The first loading position retracts the pusher away from the distal end region of the delivery device <b>400</b> allowing the nose cone assembly <b>274</b> (or entire cartridge <b>200</b>) to be coupled to the delivery device <b>400</b>. The second, primed position advances the pusher towards the distal end of the delivery device <b>400</b> to advance the cut stent <b>105</b> through the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. Preferably, the pusher is advanced to the second, primed position prior to insertion of the shaft <b>210</b> through the cornea. The delivery device <b>400</b> can additionally incorporate a movable guard <b>432</b> arranged to prevent a user from inadvertently pushing the slider beyond the second primed position. The guard <b>432</b> can be pushed down toward the housing <b>405</b> of the delivery device so that a second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>is covered by the guard <b>432</b> preventing the second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>from being inadvertently activated. The guard <b>432</b> has a length so that the guard <b>432</b> extends over (or has a feature <b>433</b> that extends within) at least a portion of the slider track <b>435</b> thereby blocking the first actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>from moving further distal in addition to blocking the second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). Once the stent <b>105</b> is advanced to the primed position and is ready to be deployed in the eye, the guard <b>432</b> can be rotated up out of the way revealing the second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>and removing the features <b>433</b> from the track <b>435</b>.

The guard <b>432</b> can also be fully removed from the device <b>400</b> or the device <b>400</b> not include any guard <b>432</b>. The housing of the device <b>400</b> can include one or more marks <b>434</b> intended to provide feedback to a user regarding the position of the push rod <b>420</b> through the shaft <b>210</b>. The advancement of the push rod <b>420</b> into one or more positions relative to the housing can also provide tactile feedback to a user as described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> illustrate the delivery device <b>400</b> in cross-section prior to advancing the push rod <b>420</b> to the second position and after advancing the push rod <b>420</b> to the second position. Once the nose cone assembly <b>274</b> is attached to the delivery device <b>400</b>, the first actuator <b>415</b> and the push rod <b>420</b> can be advanced from the initial, retracted first position to a second position. The first actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>and the push rod <b>420</b> can be advanced to the second position causing the push rod <b>420</b> to insert into the lumen <b>238</b> behind the material to be delivered (e.g. cut stent <b>105</b>). The guard <b>432</b> having the projecting feature <b>433</b> on its underneath side can prevent the first actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>from sliding beyond the second position. The location of the second position is designed to place the leading face of the push rod <b>420</b> a predefined distance away from the distal tip of the shaft <b>210</b> (e.g. 6 mm). Once the user has created the desired cleft and is ready to deliver material from the lumen, the push rod <b>420</b> can be advanced to its third, forward-most position (with the guard <b>432</b> out of the way or otherwise removed or absent from the device <b>400</b>). The second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>can be engaged to release the material from the shaft <b>210</b>. The second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>as described elsewhere herein can retract the shaft <b>210</b> while the push rod <b>420</b> remains fixed ultimately releasing the stent <b>105</b> from the lumen. The nose cone assembly <b>274</b> withdraws and the push rod <b>420</b> stays fixed. The push rod <b>420</b> can also be advanced to deploy the stent <b>105</b> from the lumen <b>238</b>. The stent <b>105</b> can be deployed from the lumen <b>238</b> so that at least a portion of the stent <b>105</b> is positioned between tissue layers, such as within a supraciliary space between ciliary tissue and scleral tissue, or within Schlemm's Canal. The stent <b>105</b> can be deployed so that it is positioned within the supraciliary space so that at least a distal region is positioned between ciliary tissue and the sclera and a proximal end is within the supraciliary cleft. The proximal end need not project into the anterior chamber when positioned within the supraciliary cleft. Preferably, the proximal end of the stent <b>105</b> is positioned so that it remains flush with the cleft positioned between ciliary tissue and scleral tissue and does not extend into the anterior chamber. The one or more fenestrations <b>276</b> within the shaft <b>210</b> and/or the presence of the substantially transparent or translucent outer tube member <b>278</b> forming the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can aid in positioning the stent <b>105</b> to be flush with the cleft by assisting in visual inspection of the lumen <b>238</b> and the stent <b>105</b> inside the lumen <b>238</b> as it is urged distally through the lumen <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">Maintaining the fixed location of the push rod <b>420</b> during deployment of the stent <b>105</b> can be aided by a mechanical backstop <b>450</b>. The backstop <b>450</b> can prevent the push rod <b>420</b> from being forced proximally by the stent <b>105</b> within the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. The backstop <b>450</b> can be located within the housing <b>405</b> below a slider track <b>435</b> in the housing <b>405</b> through which the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>slides. The backstop <b>450</b> is sized and shaped to engage with a corresponding region of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>positioned within the housing <b>405</b>. An external portion of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>extends outside the slider track <b>435</b> of the housing <b>405</b> and is configured for a user to engage the actuator <b>415</b><i>a</i>. An internal portion of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>is positioned within the housing <b>405</b> and is coupled to the proximal end region <b>444</b> of the push rod <b>420</b>. Advancement of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>along the slider track <b>435</b> urges the push rod <b>420</b> distally relative to the housing <b>405</b> so that the distal end of the push rod <b>420</b> is urged toward the opening of the shaft <b>210</b>. The internal portion of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>that is located within the housing <b>405</b> can also include a flexure <b>452</b> having a projection <b>451</b> that extends upward toward the slider track <b>435</b>. The flexure <b>452</b> is movable between a compressed position and a relaxed configuration. When the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>is in the fully withdrawn position and slid to a proximal end of the slider track <b>435</b>, the flexure <b>452</b> is urged downward by an inner surface of the housing <b>405</b> into the compressed position. As the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>slides distally along the slider track <b>435</b>, the projection <b>451</b> also slides along inside the housing <b>405</b> until it reaches the backstop <b>450</b>. The flexure <b>452</b> relaxes upward into the relaxed configuration upon reaching the location of the backstop <b>450</b>. The projection <b>451</b> on the upper surface of the flexure <b>452</b> contacts an upper end of the housing <b>405</b> and the proximal surface of the projection <b>451</b> engages with the distal-facing surface of the backstop <b>450</b>. The engagement between the surfaces of the backstop <b>450</b> and the projection <b>451</b> prevents any incidental proximal motion of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>and thus, prevents proximal motion of the push rod <b>420</b> that might occur during deployment of the stent <b>105</b> from the shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>G-<b>17</b>H</figref> show the external portion of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>outside the housing <b>405</b> is abutting against the feature <b>433</b> on the button guard <b>432</b> projecting within the slider track <b>435</b>.

The button guard <b>432</b> can be rotated up out of the way revealing the second actuator <b>415</b><i>b</i>. Pressing the second actuator <b>415</b><i>b </i>causes the stent <b>105</b> to be deployed from the shaft <b>210</b>, such as by retracting the shaft <b>210</b> while the push rod <b>420</b> remains fixed at the primed position. The backstop <b>450</b> prevents the push rod <b>420</b> from moving proximally along with the shaft <b>210</b>. A user may retract the actuator <b>415</b><i>a</i>, if desired, by lifting the forward end region of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>to cause the rearward end with the projection <b>451</b> to flex downward due to the flexibility of the flexure <b>452</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>I</figref>). Downward movement of the rearward end of the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>disengages the projection <b>451</b> from the backstop <b>450</b> allowing the actuator <b>415</b><i>a </i>to move proximally along the slider track <b>435</b>, for example, to reset the instrument for a further use.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">The delivery device <b>400</b> and the cartridge <b>200</b> (or nose cone assembly <b>274</b>) can be single-use devices that incorporates a lock-out following deployment of the stent <b>105</b> or may be sterilized and re-used.

A patch of tissue can be cut by the cutting device and loaded into the nose cone assembly, which in turn, can be transferred from the main assembly of the cutting device back to being coupled with the delivery device for use in deployment in a patient. The configuration of the nose cone assembly can vary including any of the transferrable cartridges described herein. In an implementation, the nose cone assembly may be mounted relative to a cutting assembly by coupling a proximal end of the nose cone to the base such that a longitudinal axis of the lumen of the shaft extending distally from the nose cone aligns with a longitudinal axis of a corresponding conduit out from the slot. A tissue patch can be placed within a loading zone area of the base relative to a movable stopper plate on the main assembly. The loading zone area and movable stopper plate may both be part of the base of the main assembly. The patch can be laid inside of one or more alignment features of the loading zone and slid forward into a cutting zone until the patch abuts the stopper plate. Once positioned against the stopper plate, the tissue patch is positioned a specified width by the cutter. Thus, the stopper plate provides a calibrated stopping point for the tissue patch prior to cutting. An element designed to fix the tissue patch in this position can be activated such as being lowered down over the tissue patch to hold the tissue in place and optionally compress the tissue to a specific height prior to cutting. Once this holding plate is lowered down onto the patch to hold it in place, the cutting lever can be lowered to cut the tissue patch with one or more blades. The stopper plate and holding plate can be moved away from the cut stent and the remainder of the tissue patch removed from the assembly. The cut stent can be loaded using a tissue loader slider. The tissue loader slider can urge the cut stent into position relative to the longitudinal axis of the shaft in the nose cone assembly. For example, the tissue loader slider can be put into place and slid as far forward as possible until the slider abuts a ledge on the main assembly indicating that the cut stent has been fully delivered into the compression channel and is ready to be advanced into the shaft of the nose cone assembly. An elongate tool such as a tissue advancer rod can be inserted into the main assembly along the longitudinal axis to urge the cut stent from the main assembly into the shaft of the nose cone assembly. The rod can be designed to advance the tissue slide towards the tip of the nose cone assembly without pushing the cut stent entirely out of the lumen of the shaft. The nose cone assembly can then be disconnected from the main assembly and attached to a delivery device for deployment into a patient.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In other implementations the cartridge <b>200</b> itself holds the patch of tissue for cutting.

The cover <b>214</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> is replaced onto the base <b>224</b> and advanced through the slot <b>215</b> until the lower portion <b>222</b> of the cover <b>214</b> engages the patch of material <b>101</b> trapping it against the projection <b>271</b>. The cover <b>214</b> can compress and/or tension the patch of material <b>101</b> within the cartridge <b>200</b> when in the closed configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the loaded tissue cartridge <b>200</b> can be installed into the receptacle <b>306</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> with the handles <b>343</b> in the open configuration. Once installed, the cutting member <b>312</b> can be actuated by lowering the handles <b>343</b> towards the base <b>302</b> thereby urging the blades <b>344</b> towards the patch of material <b>101</b> until the blades <b>344</b> of the cutting member <b>312</b> fully slice through the patch of material <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). With the blades <b>344</b> still in the full cut position relative to the cartridge <b>200</b>, the pusher <b>320</b> of the cutting device <b>300</b> can be urged distally to prime the shaft <b>210</b> and place the now cut stent <b>105</b> within the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> towards the opening <b>230</b> from the lumen <b>238</b> near the distal end region <b>212</b> of the shaft <b>210</b>. The pusher <b>320</b> can be retracted from the cartridge <b>200</b> and the cartridge <b>200</b> removed from the cutting device <b>300</b>. As described elsewhere herein, removal of the cartridge <b>200</b> from the cutting device <b>300</b> can include removing the entire cartridge <b>200</b> from the device <b>300</b> or detaching a nose cone assembly <b>274</b> of the cartridge <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The primed tissue cartridge <b>200</b> having the cut stent <b>105</b> positioned within the lumen <b>238</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can be installed with the delivery device <b>400</b> (e.g., inserted within the receptacle <b>412</b> or attached by a bayonet connector <b>413</b> or other attachment mechanism <b>425</b>). The push rod <b>420</b> of the delivery device <b>400</b> is withdrawn in the proximal-most position and the cartridge <b>200</b> coupled to the delivery device <b>400</b>. The push rod <b>420</b> can be advanced using a first actuator <b>415</b> from the first, retracted position suitable for loading the cartridge <b>200</b> to a second primed position so that the delivery device <b>400</b> and cartridge <b>200</b> are now ready to be used on a patient.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">In general, the stent <b>105</b> positioned within the shaft <b>210</b> can be implanted through a clear corneal or scleral incision that is formed using the shaft <b>210</b> or a device separate from the cartridge <b>200</b>. A viewing lens such as a gonioscopy lens can be positioned adjacent the cornea. The viewing lens enables viewing of internal regions of the eye, such as the scleral spur and scleral junction, from a location in front of the eye. The viewing lens may optionally include one or more guide channels sized to receive the shaft <b>210</b>. An endoscope can also be used during delivery to aid in visualization. Ultrasonic guidance can be used as well using high-resolution bio-microscopy, OCT, and the like. Alternatively, a small endoscope can be inserted through another limbal incision in the eye to image the eye during implantation.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">The distal tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> can penetrate through the cornea (or sclera) to access the anterior chamber. In this regard, the single incision can be made in the eye, such as within the limbus of the cornea. In an embodiment, the incision is very close to the limbus, such as either at the level of the limbus or within 2 mm of the limbus in the clear cornea. The shaft <b>210</b> can be used to make the incision or a separate cutting device can be used. For example, a knife-tipped device or diamond knife can be used initially to enter the cornea. A second device with a spatula tip can then be advanced over the knife tip wherein the plane of the spatula is positioned to coincide with the dissection plane. The spatula tip device can be the shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">The corneal incision can have a size that is sufficient to permit passage of the shaft <b>210</b>. In an embodiment, the incision is about 1 mm in size. In another embodiment, the incision is no greater than about 2.85 mm in size. In another embodiment, the incision is no greater than about 2.85 mm and is greater than about 1.5 mm. It has been observed that an incision of up to 2.85 mm is a self-sealing incision.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">After insertion through the incision, the shaft <b>210</b> can be advanced into the anterior chamber along a pathway that enables the stent <b>105</b> to be delivered from the anterior chamber into the target location, such as the supraciliary or suprachoroidal space. With the shaft positioned for approach, the shaft <b>210</b> can be advanced further into the eye such that the distal-most tip <b>216</b> of the shaft <b>210</b> penetrates the tissue at the angle of the eye, for example, the iris root or a region of the ciliary body or the iris root part of the ciliary body near its tissue border with the scleral spur.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">The scleral spur is an anatomic landmark on the wall of the angle of the eye. The scleral spur is above the level of the iris but below the level of the trabecular meshwork. In some eyes, the scleral spur can be masked by the lower band of the pigmented trabecular meshwork and be directly behind it. The shaft <b>210</b> can travel along a pathway that is toward the angle of the eye and the scleral spur such that the shaft <b>210</b> passes near the scleral spur on the way to the supraciliary space, but does not necessarily penetrate the scleral spur during delivery. Rather, the shaft <b>210</b> can abut the scleral spur and move downward to dissect the tissue boundary between the sclera and the ciliary body, the dissection entry point starting just below the scleral spur near the iris root or the iris root portion of the ciliary body. In another embodiment, the delivery pathway of the implant intersects the scleral spur.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">The shaft <b>210</b> can approach the angle of the eye from the same side of the anterior chamber as the deployment location such that the shaft <b>210</b> does not have to be advanced across the iris. Alternately, the shaft <b>210</b> can approach the angle of the eye from across the anterior chamber AC such that the shaft <b>210</b> is advanced across the iris and/or the anterior chamber toward the opposite angle of the eye. The shaft <b>210</b> can approach the angle of the eye along a variety of pathways. The shaft <b>210</b> does not necessarily cross over the eye and does not intersect the center axis of the eye. In other words, the corneal incision and the location where the stent <b>105</b> is implanted at the angle of the eye can be in the same quadrant when viewed looking toward the eye along the optical axis. Also, the pathway of the stent <b>105</b> from the corneal incision to the angle of the eye ought not to pass through the centerline of the eye to avoid interfering with the pupil.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">The shaft <b>210</b> can be continuously advanced into the eye, for example approximately 6 mm. The dissection plane of the shaft <b>210</b> can follow the curve of the inner scleral wall such that the stent <b>105</b> mounted in the shaft, for example after penetrating the iris root or the iris root portion of the ciliary body CB, can bluntly dissect the boundary between tissue layers of the scleral spur and the ciliary body CB such that a distal region of the stent <b>105</b> extends through the supraciliary space and then, further on, is positioned between the tissue boundaries of the sclera and the choroid forming the suprachoroidal space.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Once properly positioned, the stent <b>105</b> can be released from the shaft <b>210</b>. In some implementations, the stent <b>105</b> can be released by withdrawing the shaft <b>210</b> while the push rod <b>420</b> prevents the stent <b>105</b> from withdrawing with the shaft <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">Once implanted, the stent <b>105</b> forms a fluid communication pathway between the anterior chamber and the target pathway (e.g., supraciliary space or suprachoroidal space). As mentioned, the stent <b>105</b> is not limited to being implanted into the suprachoroidal or supraciliary space. The stent <b>105</b> can be implanted in other locations that provide fluid communication between the anterior chamber and locations in the eye, such as Schlemm's Canal or a subconjunctival location of the eye. In another implementation, the stent <b>105</b> is implanted to form a fluid communication pathway between the anterior chamber and the Schlemm's Canal and/or communication pathway between the anterior chamber and a subconjunctival location of the eye. It should be appreciated the device described herein can also be used to deliver a stent trans-sclerally as well from an ab interno approach.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">As mentioned above, the material used to form the stent can be impregnated with one or more therapeutic agents for additional treatment of an eye disease process.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">A wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancerous growth, may be prevented or treated using the stents described herein. More specifically, ocular conditions such as glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, keratitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, cystoid macular edema, herpes simplex viral and adenoviral infections can be treated or prevented.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The following classes of drugs could be delivered using the devices of the present invention: antiproliferatives, antifibrotics, anesthetics, analgesics, cell transport/mobility impending agents such as colchicine, vincristine, cytochalasin B and related compounds; antiglaucoma drugs including beta-blockers such as timolol, betaxolol, atenolol, and prostaglandin analogues such as bimatoprost, travoprost, latanoprost etc; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, dichlorphenamide, diamox; and neuroprotectants such as nimodipine and related compounds.
