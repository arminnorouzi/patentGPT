Researching one or more topics not only requires searching and browsing for related content, but typically requires manually bookmarking and/or recording of how and where to access any found content related to the one or more topics. This is particularly problematic when the user needs access to bookmarks across different types of content (e.g., websites, video, app interfaces, etc.). Accordingly, an improved user interface is needed to identify topic-related content as it is viewed, organize the content as bookmarks for future access, and quickly provide the bookmarks for different types of content in an easily recognizable way using, e.g., a single view in the user interface.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A considerable amount of content is available for consumption, and this content is in a competition for potential audiences to both start and complete the content. Not only does content, such as video, animation, music, audiobooks, ebooks, playlists, podcasts, images, slideshows, games, text, and other media have to attract an audience; content must keep and sustain an audience. With competing content readily available, a content item has limited time to make an audience feel comfortable before an audience may decide to move on to other content.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Finding or re-finding that content is not always straightforward. Devices facilitate delivery of content for consumption at any time, as well as nearly in any place, which does not help to increase tolerance for content falling outside of an audience's usual preferences. Abilities of devices to provide content to a content consumer are often enhanced with the utilization of advanced hardware with increased memory and fast processors in devices. Devices such as computers, telephones, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, speakers/microphones (e.g., with a virtual assistant), activity trackers, e-readers, voice-controlled devices, servers, televisions, digital content systems, video game consoles, and other internet-enabled appliances can provide and deliver content almost instantly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Content delivery systems may use, for example, interactive content guidance applications to recommend content and facilitate content selection. Typically, viewer preferences are associated with a profile or an account such as a viewer profile, user profile, user account, subscriber profile, or a subscriber account. As used herein, &#x201c;user&#x201d; may be used as an equivalent to viewer, user account, subscriber account, or other account with content provider systems and/or services. Preferences may be stored as part of a viewer profile and may be referred to as a user profile. A user profile may be stored in the cloud (e.g., a remote secure server) and accessed by interactive content guidance applications initiated by a viewer (e.g., log-in). Profiles may store all types of content consumed and of various content types. For instance, profiles may include viewing and browsing histories of websites, web pages, books, audio, articles, posts, video, and other media. Browsing history may be stored as part of a viewing history (e.g., as part of a profile) and may be referred to as a user history. In some cases, profiles may be stored as part of virtual cloud drives, e.g., a digital briefcase or a cloud storage locker named &#x201c;My Stuff.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tracking browsing and/or consumption history via profiles may be valuable to both a service and a viewer. By tracking content consumed by a viewer, an interactive content guidance application may suggest another program based on similarities (or differences) with previously consumed content. For a content delivery service, tracking a viewing history may generate valuable data that can be used to aid in content recommendation algorithms. With a user history, an interactive content guidance application may indicate content that a viewer has already consumed or has yet to consume. For instance, a user may review his user history to identify content, e.g., a webpage or video, consumed at a particular date or time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In existing approaches, identifying a previously viewed content item within a user history is not an easy task. Often, it may be a manual task of scrolling through lists of consumed content over a period of hours or days. A user can easily misremember the time or date that a content item may have been accessed. The user history interface itself does not typically make a task to review and re-identify a content item easy. Often, the user history interface may only offer a web address or (too) few words of description to identify a previously accessed content item. At best, the content items may be organized by a date and time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For instance, searching for and collecting content to cook or prepare a multicourse dinner, planned for the following week, may guide a user to browse various webpages, videos, blogs, social media posts and other content about a variety of foods for appetizers, salads, breads, main courses, and desserts. When it is time to cook and prepare the meal, recapturing the best recipes, videos, guides, and tips is hardly an insignificant manual task. There exists a need to identify topic-related content as it is viewed, organize the content as bookmarks for future access, and quickly provide the bookmarks in an easily recognizable way.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A similar need may arise, for instance, when a person is researching one or more topics such as World War II, network cloud services, gardening with Monstera plants, or neural networks. For example, a user may be reading new articles on cloud web services and then notice that her plant needs pruning. A user may be reading a chapter of an eBook on building artificial intelligence when he realizes he needs to record an interview with a Pearl Harbor survivor that appears on television. Users may be researching various topics at different intensity levels and still want to collect their research in a simple, automated manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One approach may be to rely on a user history that uses a search and/or filter of previously accessed resources. This approach may help in some situations but depends too much on human memory to pick out keywords and/or times. For instance, searching a user history for recipes may require a user remembering keywords for each course. A user history may include content accessed over several days, weeks, months, or more. A user may research recipes one or two weeks ahead of an important dinner party. In the meantime, a user may completely forget to re-investigate a good recipe for cr&#xe8;me br&#xfb;l&#xe9;e that was found for a dessert course. Dessert is difficult to forget for many people; still, forgetting to search specifically for &#x201c;cr&#xe8;me br&#xfb;l&#xe9;e&#x201d; in a user history, in order to relocate an excellent recipe, may lead to at least one missing dessert at a dinner party. Likewise, preparation for an exam may be incomplete without recalling a proper keyword to bring back a valuable study resource.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An approach may involve manual selection of favorites or bookmarks. For instance, as a user is browsing videos (or websites), the user would be required to &#x201c;favorite&#x201d; or &#x201c;bookmark&#x201d; each content item found to be relevant and/or notable. This requires too much manual work by the user. A user may forget to bookmark an important video on D-Day that he wanted to show to a young student learning about the era. A user may see a dessert recipe and quickly click past a very relevant video for making spaghetti, forgetting to bookmark the video. Weeks later, when the user is sharing research with the young student or preparing a pasta dinner, missing the bookmark may mean missing content (or wasted time tracking down the right content). There exists a need to automatedly tag content items as they are browsed and store pointers to the content in an organized and easily accessible manner.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Described herein are systems or methods of providing content, e.g., as part of a smart bookmark system that collects consumed resources of different type related to a topic in a data structure and presents the bookmarks from the data structure in an accessible, recognizable manner. Automatic recording and collection of content as bookmarks, e.g., in a bookmark structure that is related to an identified topic or subtopic, may allow easy storage, recall, navigation, preview, and recommendation of content. Displaying such bookmarks from the bookmark structure(s) may take forms like trees, hierarchies, menus, mind-maps, linked lists, charts and graphs, and various other presentations and previews of bookmarked content. In some embodiments, a summary or slideshow of a topic or subtopic may be generated from the bookmarks in the data structure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some embodiments may utilize a bookmark engine to perform one or more parts of the systems and methods of providing content, e.g., as part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. For instance, a bookmark engine may run on a server of a content delivery platform or a streaming service. A bookmark engine may run on a component of a television, set-top box, computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device able to access a content delivery network and/or the internet.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Described herein are systems or methods of organizing content in a data structure. For instance, a bookmark engine may generate a bookmark data structure for a topic and determine retrieval of a first content item related to the topic, of a first content type. Then, in response to determining retrieval of the first content item, the bookmark engine may add the first content item to the bookmark data structure for the topic. The bookmark engine may then determine retrieval of a second content item related to the topic, of a second content type and, in response to determining retrieval of the second content item, the bookmark engine may add the second content item to the bookmark data structure for the topic.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may generate, for display in a user interface (UI), a menu based on the data structure, the menu comprising a first UI element (e.g., for a first content item) and a second UI element (e.g., second content item). In some embodiment, when interaction with the first UI element is detected, access to the first content item of the first content type may be provided, and when interaction with the second UI element is detected, access to the second content item of the second content type is provided. In some embodiments, for example, the first UI element and the second UI element may be displayed in an order based on corresponding metadata such as time published, content type, and/or time of retrieval.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some embodiments may include capabilities to add a content item to the bookmark data structure for the topic with a uniform resource locator (URL) for the content item and provide access to the content item by opening the URL to the content item, e.g., when a UI element is selected or hovered over. In some embodiments, access to first content item may comprise displaying a preview of the content item. Some embodiments, for instance, may comprise an image of the content item with a portion of the image highlighted or annotated, e.g., as a preview. The privier portion may vary based on type of bookmarked content. For example, a bookmark to a website may include a portion of the website; a bookmark to a video may feature several frames of that video (e.g., in GIF or MP4 format); a bookmark to an app may show a key portion of an app interface; and a bookmark to audio may preview a short audio clip. Some embodiments may store pointers to content types such as a webpage, website, search results, blog, ebook, podcast, audio file, on-demand video, streaming video, and/or recorded video. Some embodiments may store and/or use links to different content types for different content items in a bookmark data structure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may also determine a retrieval of a third content item related to a new topic and unrelated to a first topic (e.g., of the first two content items) and, in response to determining retrieval of the third content item, generate a new bookmark data structure for the new topic and add the third content item to the new bookmark data structure for the new topic.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may determine retrieval of the first content item by recording a timestamp, and adding the first bookmarked content item to the bookmark data structure further comprises adding the timestamp. In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may determine retrieval of the first content item by a user, e.g., saving, selecting as a bookmark, instructing to record, highlighting text or graphics, and/or printing. For instance, in some embodiments, a content type may be a recorded video, and determining retrieval of the content item may be based on instructions to record at least a portion of a video related to a topic. In some cases, a content type may be a webpage, and determining retrieval of the content item may be based on detection of a user highlighting text.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some embodiments may include a bookmark mode. For instance, generating a bookmark data structure for a topic may be performed when a user explicitly enables the bookmark mode. In some embodiments, generating a bookmark data structure for a topic may be performed in response to user enablement of a bookmark mode. In some embodiments, generating a bookmark data structure for the topic may be performed in response to a user accessing a plurality of content items related to the topic in a certain time period (e.g., in two hours, one day, five days, etc.), such as when the plurality becomes greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold (e.g., one item, three items, or 7 items).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may determine retrieval of a content item related to a topic by determining a user accessing a plurality of content items related to the topic, and, if/when the plurality greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold for the topic (e.g., two items, five items, or ten items), add the content item(s) to the bookmark data structure for the topic. In some embodiments, a bookmark engine may add a content item to the bookmark data structure for the topic by prompting a user to identify a bookmarked segment in the content item, receiving an input of the bookmarked segment in response to the prompt, and storing the bookmarked segment in the bookmark data structure for the topic with the content item. For example, when the system is operating in bookmark mode related to one or more specific topics and the user requests a bookmark, the system may generate for display a prompt for the user to select a desired portion of content (e.g., part of a web page, or a segment of a video). In some embodiments, a selected portion may later be used to generate a preview when a user interacts with the created bookmark.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative user interface in bookmark mode adding a segment, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative user interface presenting bookmark previews as part of a bookmark collection, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative data structure for organizing and presenting bookmarks, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for generating and organizing bookmarks, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flow diagram of a process for training a machine learning model to label bookmarked content by topic(s), in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of illustrative devices, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram of an illustrative system, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Devices may be designed to facilitate content consumption.

In scenario <b>100</b>, interface <b>110</b> is presented on a screen of device <b>101</b>. By way of a non-limiting example, scenario <b>100</b> depicts bookmarking a segment of a television program and storing the bookmark in a bookmark data structure. For instance, interface <b>110</b> may present a prompt to bookmark a segment and present a notification that the segment has been bookmarked to a bookmark collection for a topic.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary processes such as generating and organizing bookmarks are described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and may be carried out by a bookmark engine, e.g., as part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as device <b>101</b> and devices depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. In some embodiments, interface <b>110</b> may comprise a bookmark engine or function as a bookmark engine.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Interface <b>110</b> depicts providing content <b>102</b> for consumption via interface <b>110</b> on device <b>101</b>. Device <b>101</b> may be, for instance, a television, set-top box, computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device able to access a content delivery network that provides interface <b>110</b> and content <b>102</b>. Interface <b>110</b> may be a part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. Content <b>102</b> may be delivered via a content delivery system using one or more of cable, fiber, satellite, antenna, streaming over IP, wireless, or other content delivery methods. Content <b>102</b> may be captured live for live broadcast and/or streaming. For instance, content <b>102</b> may be a cooking show such as a show &#x201c;Pastability&#x201d; available via, e.g., Chef Channel, featuring a live demonstration of preparing food (e.g., spaghetti and meatballs). Interface <b>110</b>, for example, displays a guide bar, e.g., guide bar <b>140</b>, in the lower portion of the screen for tracking progress of playback of content <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Interface <b>110</b>, for example, displays a prompt, prompt <b>112</b>, at the top of the screen. In some embodiments, interface <b>110</b> may ask a viewer via prompt <b>112</b> if the viewer wants to bookmark a segment. For instance, prompt <b>112</b> says &#x201c;BOOKMARK MODE: ON&#x201d; indicating a that a bookmark mode has been turned on (e.g., by the viewer) and &#x201c;BOOKMARK THIS SEGMENT?&#x201d; inquiring if a viewer wants to bookmark the currently viewed segment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, interface <b>110</b> may use a &#x201c;bookmark mode&#x201d; to designate an appropriate time to inquire or suggest when to automatically add content to a bookmark data structure. For instance, a bookmark engine may inquire if a viewer wants to bookmark a content item only if bookmark mode is turned on. In some embodiments, bookmark mode may have an on/off toggle in a viewer profile or viewer settings. In some embodiments, bookmark mode may be turned on by a trigger such as a user input (e.g., from a remote control, touchscreen, microphone, etc.) indicating a trick-play function, a saving function, a record function, and/or a bookmark function. For instance, bookmark mode may be activated by a voice command to bookmark a first content item (or segment). In some embodiments, bookmark mode may be activated by remote control input such as instructions to record a show or segment. In some embodiments, bookmark mode may be enabled by pausing a program for a predetermined time duration, e.g., 5 seconds. In some cases, bookmark mode may be enabled by highlighting text, such as a recipe or article passage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, bookmark mode may be turned on or off for individual topics. For instance, bookmark mode may be turned on for a food topic, and content or segments that are related to food are automatically saved to relevant bookmark structure(s). Likewise, in some embodiments, bookmark mode may be turned off for a topic, such as &#x201c;'90s Music,&#x201d; and related content or segments are not actively saved to relevant bookmark structure(s) without bookmark mode being reactivated.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In scenario <b>100</b>, bookmark mode is depicted as activated for interface <b>110</b> as depicted in prompt <b>112</b>. Since bookmark mode is turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; in scenario <b>100</b>, prompt <b>112</b> asks whether the viewer wants to bookmark this segment&#x2014;e.g., save the segment to a bookmark data structure. In some embodiments, a viewer may respond positively to prompt <b>112</b> by inputting &#x201c;YES,&#x201d; &#x201c;OK,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Enter,&#x201d; e.g., via a remote control or touchscreen. In some embodiments, a viewer may respond positively to prompt <b>112</b> by clicking on or selecting a word in the prompt, e.g., via a remote control or touchscreen. In some embodiments, a viewer may respond negatively to prompt <b>112</b> by inputting &#x201c;No,&#x201d; &#x201c;Exit,&#x201d; or selecting a close button such as the &#x201c;X&#x201d; in the corner of prompt <b>112</b>, e.g., via a remote control or touchscreen. In some embodiments, a viewer may not respond to prompt <b>112</b> and a timeout function returns a default response. For instance, if prompt <b>112</b> is not answered in 5 seconds a default &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; response may be used. In some cases, a user profile may store a preference for a timeout response when in bookmark mode.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a prompt, such as prompt <b>112</b>, may request a user to select a portion of content that is desired. For instance, if bookmarking a webpage or blog, a prompt may request a viewer to highlight a passage of text to save with the bookmark data structure. In some embodiments, an editable, pre-selected portion may be highlighted, e.g., based on an identification of a topic, screen position, keywords, and/or other means of identifying relevant information. In some embodiments, a prompt may request a viewer to set bounds of a content segment, e.g., moving/dragging pointers indicating a beginning and/or end of a key portion of a video. In some cases, a video segment may be pre-selected, e.g., based on time, scene, commercial breaks, etc., and a viewer permitted to adjust start and/or end time limits.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a next screen of scenario <b>100</b>, interface <b>110</b> includes notification <b>114</b>, and guide bar <b>140</b> includes segment <b>145</b> as highlighted.

For instance, notification <b>114</b> of interface <b>110</b> says &#x201c;Segment has been added to &#x2018;Dinner Recipes&#x2019; bookmark.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a highlighted portion of a guide bar may indicate that a segment of a content item may be recorded/saved to a bookmark data structure for a relevant topic. The bottom screen of scenario <b>100</b> also depicts, for example, a highlighted portion of guide bar <b>140</b>, e.g., segment <b>145</b>. Segment <b>145</b> may indicate a portion of content <b>102</b> that was recorded or saved as relevant to a topic of a bookmark data structure. In some embodiments, a segment may be recorded to a hard drive or a cloud server and a pointer to the stored segment saved to a bookmark data structure for a relevant topic. In some embodiments, a notification may identify a topic or subtopic for content stored in a bookmark data structure. For instance, notification <b>114</b> indicates that a segment, segment <b>145</b>, was added to a topic &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; of a bookmark data structure. In some embodiments, a topic such as &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; may be a part of a larger data structure for all bookmarks. In some embodiments, a topic such as &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; may be a part of a larger data structure for all bookmarks related to food and recipes. In some embodiments, a topic such as &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; may be a separate data structure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Scenario <b>100</b> further depicts an exemplary bookmark data structure illustrated as bookmark collection <b>120</b>. Bookmark collection <b>120</b> may appear on-screen or be stored behind the scenes. In some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may comprise a hierarchical data structure, trees, linked lists, queues, playlists, matrices, tables, blockchains, and/or various other data structures. A bookmark data structure may include, for instance, several levels of topics, subtopics, sub-subtopics, and other linkage among topics. In some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may be stored in or with a user profile, e.g., at a server in a content delivery network. In some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may be stored, for instance, at an encrypted cloud server. Moreover, in some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may be stored at a user device. For instance, a user profile and/or history may need to be kept private, e.g., encrypted and stored only at one user device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In scenario <b>100</b>, a bookmark data structure is depicted as bookmark collection <b>120</b> with a collection of &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; for several content items of various content types such as blogs, articles, videos, programs, search results, photographs, etc. In some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may comprise several topics or subtopics. For instance, bookmark collection <b>120</b> comprises &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; as a topic with subtopics of steak subtopic <b>121</b> and pasta subtopic <b>122</b>. Each of steak subtopic <b>121</b> and pasta subtopic <b>122</b>, within the bookmark data structure, is depicted to comprise bookmarks to several content items of various content types. Pasta subtopic <b>122</b>, for instance, may include bookmarks <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b>. Bookmark <b>124</b> indicates a content item titled &#x201c;Angel Hair&#x201d; from &#x201c;Tuscany Blog&#x201d; was saved to the bookmark data structure.

There are many ways to generate, organize, and present bookmarks, and process <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary method generate and organize a bookmark data structure. For instance, a bookmarked content item may be related to a pre-established topic/subtopic, or a new topic may have to be generated.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Some embodiments may utilize a bookmark engine to perform one or more parts of process <b>400</b>, e.g., as part of a content delivery platform or interactive content guidance application, stored and executed by one or more of the processors and memory of a device and/or server such as those depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. For instance, a bookmark engine may run on a server of a content delivery platform like a streaming service. A bookmark engine may run on a component of a television, set-top box, computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device able to access a content delivery network.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At step <b>402</b>, the bookmark engine receives a new bookmarked content item. For instance, segment <b>145</b> of content <b>102</b> depicted in scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be considered a new bookmarked content item. Content <b>102</b>, for example, may be considered a portion of &#x201c;Pastability&#x201d; available via, e.g., Chef Channel, featuring a live demonstration of preparing food (e.g., spaghetti and meatballs). In some embodiments, a content item may be received as a link or pointer to the content item as accessed via web and/or content delivery network.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>404</b>, the bookmark engine generates a data structure for new bookmarked item. In some embodiments, a bookmark data structure may comprise a hierarchical data structure, trees, linked lists, queues, playlists, matrices, tables, blockchains, and/or various other data structures. For example, node <b>350</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be considered a generated data structure for a newly bookmarked item. In scenario <b>300</b>, node <b>350</b> comprises title <b>352</b>, e.g., &#x201c;Pastability,&#x201d; content type <b>354</b>, timestamp <b>356</b>, and address <b>358</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At step <b>406</b>, the bookmark engine identifies a topic and/or subtopic for the bookmarked item. For instance, with a portion of content <b>102</b> depicted in scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, e.g., &#x201c;Pastability,&#x201d; a topic of &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; and a subtopic of &#x201c;Pasta&#x201d; may be determined. Identifying a topic may be performed in several ways. Some embodiments may use a machine learning model to label a topic and/or subtopic for a content item. A machine learning model may be trained by a process such a process <b>500</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In some embodiments, labeling of topics or subtopics may be performed with data analysis. In some embodiments, labeling of topics or subtopics may be accomplished with metadata. In some embodiments, labeling of topics or subtopics may be performed using keywords and/or internet searches. In some embodiments, content may be categorized or labeled with more than one topic.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>408</b>, the bookmark engine compares the topic with other bookmarked item topics. For instance, a labeled content item topic of &#x201c;pasta recipe&#x201d; may be compared to topics already established in a bookmarking structure, such as &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; or &#x201c;World War II.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step <b>410</b>, the bookmark engine determines whether the topic is related to one or more other bookmarked item topics. For example, a topic of &#x201c;Dinner Recipe&#x201d; for &#x201c;Pastability&#x201d; may be matched with, e.g., &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; of topic <b>310</b> depicted in data structure <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>412</b>, the bookmark engine creates a new bookmarked item topic. For example, if there are no matches of a labeled topic for a content item, a new topic may be created. In some embodiments, a new topic may not be created until there are a predetermined number of unmatched content items with similar topics. For instance, if the only topics are &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; and &#x201c;World War II,&#x201d; but two content items relevant to gardening are generated, a new topic of &#x201c;Gardening&#x201d; may be generated. In some embodiments, when there are a predetermined amount of items related to a subtopic, it may elevated to be a topic (or created as its own bookmark data structure). After step <b>412</b>, the bookmark engine awaits the next content item to be bookmarked.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>414</b>, the bookmark engine links the data structure to the topic. In some embodiments, a bookmark node may be moved or linked to a specific topic data structure. In some embodiments, topic field data may be added to the bookmark data structure. In some embodiments, links may be made, for instance, with pointers or URLs between nodes, as depicted, e.g., in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, links may be made inherently when a new node is added to a topic data structure (or to a subtopic). In some embodiments, links may not be made until a predetermined threshold number (e.g., 3) of bookmark entries with a matching topic are saved to the data structure.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>416</b>, the bookmark engine identifies related bookmarks with the same topic. For instance, once a bookmark has a topic, a bookmark may be related to other bookmarks with that topic by sharing a subtopic.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step <b>418</b>, the bookmark engine compares a subtopic with related bookmarks. For example, the bookmark engine may compare a subtopic of &#x201c;pasta&#x201d; for content <b>102</b> depicted in scenario <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or node <b>350</b> of data structure <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, e.g., television program &#x201c;Pastability,&#x201d; to nodes <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, and other nodes of data structure <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step <b>420</b>, the bookmark engine determines whether the subtopic is related to one or more other related bookmarked items. In data structure <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for instance, nodes <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> are each linked to subtopic <b>330</b>, &#x201c;Pasta,&#x201d; and are considered to have a subtopic of or similar to &#x201c;pasta.&#x201d; In data structure <b>300</b>, the exemplary nodes linked with subtopic <b>320</b>, &#x201c;Steak,&#x201d; are considered to have a subtopic of or similar to &#x201c;steak.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the bookmark engine looks for nodes with related subtopics to link to the new bookmark node.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step <b>424</b>, the bookmark engine links data structures of subtopic-related bookmarks. For example, in data structure <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, nodes <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> are each linked to subtopic <b>330</b>, &#x201c;Pasta.&#x201d; A subtopic of &#x201c;pasta&#x201d; for &#x201c;Pastability&#x201d; may be matched and linked with nodes with, e.g., &#x201c;Pasta&#x201d; of subtopic <b>330</b>.

In some embodiments, detecting a bookmark topic may be accomplished with predictive modeling. For instance, a trained neural network may be used to classify a portion of provided content data by a topic or category. Generally, a training set comprising content data with various labeled bookmark topics may be used to train a neural network to predict a topic category for new content data.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Training a neural network to accurately detect bookmark topics may be accomplished in many ways. Some embodiments may use supervised learning where, e.g., a training data set includes labels identifying bookmark topics (and/or non-bookmark topics). Some embodiments may use unsupervised learning that may identify bookmark topics in training data by clustering similar data. Some embodiments may use semi-supervised learning where a portion of labeled content data may be combined with unlabeled data during training. In some embodiments, reinforcement learning may be used. With reinforcement learning, a predictive model is trained from a series of actions by maximizing a &#x201c;reward function,&#x201d; via rewarding correct labeling and penalizing improper labeling. Scenario <b>500</b> includes data labels <b>512</b>, indicating a supervised or semi-supervised learning situation.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A location of a bookmark topic within a video frame may be determined, for instance, by determining a subsection of a content item. In some embodiments, portions a video frame may be provided to a trained neural network for labeling and the coordinates and/or dimensions of the subsection, labeled as including a bookmark topic, may be returned. Portions of a video frame may be provided to a trained neural network as, e.g., content features. In some embodiments, labels returned by a trained neural network may include one or more categories of topics (and/or subtopics). A trained neural network may return a general category like &#x201c;Recipe&#x201d; or something as specific as &#x201c;Dinner Recipes&#x201d; or &#x201c;Pasta.&#x201d; A trained neural network may return a label of several topics identified.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Scenario <b>500</b> depicts training content data <b>510</b> along with data labels <b>512</b>. Training data for bookmark topic identification may be collected by manually labeling training contents with bookmark topics like Recipes, History, Sports, News, Technology, Science, Games, or even more detailed topics. Content data without a bookmark topic, e.g., from a control group, may also be captured and used. In some circumstances, an analyst may mark incoming content data with one or more bookmark topic labels, e.g., in near real time, to create the training data set. From the content data collected, at least two groups of data may be created: training content data <b>510</b> and test data <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In scenario <b>500</b>, training content data <b>510</b> is pre-processed using feature extraction to form training content features <b>516</b>. Pre-processing of training data is used to obtain proper data for training. In some embodiments, pre-processing may involve, for example, scaling, translating, rotating, converting, normalizing, changing of bases, and/or translating coordinate systems in content data. In some embodiments, pre-processing may involve filtering content data, e.g., to eliminate content noise. In some embodiments, text may be extracted and interpreted.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">After pre-processing, training content features <b>516</b> are fed into Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) <b>520</b> to generate an initial machine learning model, e.g., bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b>. In some embodiments, MLA <b>520</b> uses numbers, e.g., between 1 and 10, for topics and then translates the numbers to a word. The more data that is provided, the more accurate MLA <b>520</b> will be in creating a model, e.g., bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Once MLA <b>520</b> creates bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b>, test data may be fed into the model to verify the system and test how accurately model <b>540</b> behaves. In some embodiments, test data <b>524</b> is pre-processed to become a content feature <b>536</b> and passed to bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b> for a prediction. Bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b> identifies whether the input test data includes a bookmark topic or not. In some embodiments, each iteration of test data <b>524</b> is classified and reviewed for accuracy. For example, if expected label <b>550</b> is not correct, false result <b>552</b> may be fed back into MLA <b>520</b> as learning data. If, after test data <b>524</b> is classified and reviewed, model <b>540</b> does not perform as expected (e.g., an error rate below 5%) then additional training data may be provided until the model meets the expected criteria. In some embodiments, a reinforcement learning method may be incorporated with test data to reward or punish MLA <b>520</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Once bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b> works as expected, new real-time data may be fed to the model, and determinations of whether the data includes a bookmark topic may be predicted with confidence. For instance, in scenario <b>500</b>, new content data <b>530</b> may be pre-processed as content feature <b>536</b> and passed to bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b> for a prediction. Bookmark topic predictive model <b>540</b> may evaluate content feature <b>536</b> and present a label of bookmark topic or no bookmark topic for the data.
