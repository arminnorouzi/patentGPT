The injected electrons and holes are recombined in the emitting layer to form excitons. Specifically, according to the electron spin statistics theory, singlet excitons and triplet excitons are generated at a ratio of 25%:75%.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0003">A fluorescent organic EL device using light emission from singlet excitons has been applied to a full-color display such as a mobile phone and a television set, but an internal quantum efficiency is said to be at a limit of 25%. Accordingly, studies has been made to improve a performance of the organic EL device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0004">For instance, it is expected to further efficiently emit the organic EL device using triplet excitons in addition to singlet excitons. In view of the above, a highly efficient fluorescent organic EL device using thermally activated delayed fluorescence (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as &#x201c;delayed fluorescence&#x201d;) has been proposed and studied.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0005">For instance, a TADF (Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence) mechanism has been studied. This TADF mechanism uses such a phenomenon in which inverse intersystem crossing from triplet excitons to singlet excitons thermally occurs when a material having a small energy difference (&#x394;ST) between singlet energy level and triplet energy level is used. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence is explained in &#x201c;Yuki Hando-tai no Debaisu Bussei (Device Physics of Organic Semiconductors)&#x201d; (edited by ADACHI, Chihaya, published by Kodansha, issued on Apr. 1, 2012, on pages 261-268).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0006">As a compound exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), for example, a compound in which a donor moiety and an acceptor moiety are bonded in a molecule is known.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0007">For instance, Patent Literature 1 discloses an exemplary compound, in which, for instance, carbazole as well as benzofurocarbazole or benzothienocarbazole are substituents of dicyanobenzene.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature(s)</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0008">Patent Literature 1: International Publication No. WO 2020/022378</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0009">In order to improve performance of an electronic device such as a display, an organic EL device has been required to be further improved in performance.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0010">The performance of the organic EL device is evaluable in terms of luminous efficiency.

This document describes that, if an energy difference &#x394;E<sub>13 </sub>of a fluorescent material between a singlet state and a triplet state is reducible, a reverse energy transfer from the triplet state to the singlet state, which usually occurs at a low transition probability, would occur at a high efficiency to express thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Further, a mechanism of generating delayed fluorescence is explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>.<b>38</b></figref> in the document. The first compound of the present exemplary embodiment is preferably a compound exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence generated by such a mechanism.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0309">In general, emission of delayed fluorescence can be confirmed by measuring the transient PL (Photo Luminescence).</p><p id="p-0337" num="0310">The behavior of delayed fluorescence can also be analyzed based on the decay curve obtained from the transient PL measurement. The transient PL measurement is a method of irradiating a sample with a pulse laser to excite the sample, and measuring the decay behavior (transient characteristics) of PL emission after the irradiation is stopped. PL emission in TADF materials is classified into a light emission component from a singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation and a light emission component from a singlet exciton generated via a triplet exciton. The lifetime of the singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation is on the order of nanoseconds and is very short. Therefore, light emission from the singlet exciton rapidly attenuates after irradiation with the pulse laser.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0311">On the other hand, the delayed fluorescence is gradually attenuated due to light emission from a singlet exciton generated via a triplet exciton having a long lifetime. As described above, there is a large temporal difference between the light emission from the singlet exciton generated by the first PL excitation and the light emission from the singlet exciton generated via the triplet exciton. Therefore, the luminous intensity derived from delayed fluorescence can be determined.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0312"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an exemplary device for measuring the transient PL.
