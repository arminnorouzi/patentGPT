end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it is readily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details of the present invention can be modified in various ways. In addition, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description of the embodiments below.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, in the case where one particle is formed of one crystal grain, a surface of the particle is referred to as a surface of a crystal in some cases. Furthermore, for example, in the case where a plurality of crystals are adjacent to each other, a crystal grain boundary corresponds to a surface of the crystal in some cases.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EMBODIMENT 1</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, an example of a structure of a positive electrode active material manufactured by a manufacturing method of one embodiment of the present invention is described.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention includes fluorine. Fluorine can improve the wettability of a surface of the positive electrode active material, so that the surface can be homogenized. The crystal structure of the positive electrode active material obtained in this manner is less likely to be broken with repeated high-voltage charge and discharge, and a secondary battery including the positive electrode active material having such a feature has greatly improved cycle characteristics.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the unevenness of the surface of an active material particle of the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention falls within a certain range, the strength of the vicinity of the surface or a surface portion is increased to provide a positive electrode active material particle with less deterioration. For example, a lithium oxide and a fluoride are mixed and heated to form a positive electrode active material particle.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">When a portion where pure LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is exposed exists on the surface of the positive electrode active material particle, projections and depressions are generated and cobalt or oxygen is deintercalated at the time of charge and discharge to break the crystal structure, thereby causing deterioration. In order not to expose the pure LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>on the surface, it is preferable to uniformly cover the surface with a compound including magnesium. Magnesium has a function of maintaining the crystal structure (layered rock-salt crystal structure) when Li is deintercalated at the time of discharge. The magnesium (or fluorine) existing in the vicinity of the surface of the positive electrode active material particle or in the surface portion is also one of the features.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">With the above structure, even when pressure is applied to a positive electrode including the positive electrode active material in manufacturing a secondary battery, a crack is less likely to be generated and the shape of the particle can be maintained. This can cause less excess cracks to increase the electrode density.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the case where surface unevenness is larger than the above range and the surface is rough, a crack and breakage of the crystal structure might be caused physically. With the breakage of the crystal structure, pure LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>might be exposed on the surface to accelerate deterioration.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As the lithium oxide, a material with a layered rock-salt crystal structure is preferable; a composite oxide represented by LiMO<sub>2 </sub>is given, for example. As an example of the element M, one or more elements selected from Co and Ni can be given. As another example of the element M, in addition to one or more elements selected from Co and Ni, one or more elements selected from Al and Mg can be given.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When fluorine is included in the vicinity of the surface or in the surface portion, not only fluorine but also magnesium, aluminum, and nickel can be put in the vicinity of the surface or in the surface portion at high concentrations. The fluorine is inhibited from diffusing outward as a gas during annealing with the container covered with a lid, and the other elements such as aluminum diffuse into the solid material. The fluorine improves the wettability of the surface of the positive electrode active material, so that the surface is homogenized.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The composite oxide containing lithium, the transition metal, and oxygen preferably has a layered rock-salt crystal structure with few defects and distortions. Therefore, the composite oxide is preferably a composite oxide with few impurities. In the case where the composite oxide containing lithium, the transition metal, and oxygen includes a large amount of impurities, the crystal structure is highly likely to have a large number of defects or distortions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order that no impurity is included, it is preferable to perform heating with the lid put on after the fluoride is mixed to conduct surface modification of the positive electrode active material. The timing of putting the lid on the container is any one of the following: the lid is put so as to cover the container before heating, and then the container is placed in a heating furnace; the container is placed on the furnace, and then the lid is put so as to cover the container; the lid is put on the container during heating before the fluoride is melted.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">[Structure of Positive Electrode Active Material]</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A material with a layered rock-salt crystal structure, such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>), is known to have a high discharge capacity and excel as a positive electrode active material of a secondary battery. As an example of the material with a layered rock-salt crystal structure, a composite oxide represented by LiMO<sub>2 </sub>is given. As an example of the element M, one or more selected from Co and Ni can be given. As another example of the element M, in addition to one or more elements selected from Co and Ni, one or more elements selected from Al and Mg can be given.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is known that the Jahn-Teller effect in a transition metal compound varies in degree according to the number of electrons in the d orbital of the transition metal.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a compound containing nickel, distortion is likely to be caused because of the Jahn-Teller effect in some cases. Accordingly, when high-voltage charge and discharge are performed on LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, the crystal structure might be broken because of the distortion. The influence of the Jahn-Teller effect is suggested to be small in LiCoO<sub>2</sub>; hence, LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is preferable because the resistance to high-voltage charge and discharge is higher in some cases.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The positive electrode active material is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the case where cobalt is used as a transition metal contained in the positive electrode active material is described.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the positive electrode active material formed by one embodiment of the present invention, the difference in the positions of CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers can be small in repeated charge and discharge at high voltage. Furthermore, the change in the volume can be small. Accordingly, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention can achieve excellent cycle performance. In addition, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention can have a stable crystal structure in a high-voltage charging state. Thus, in the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention, a short circuit is less likely to occur while the high-voltage charging state is maintained. This is preferable because the safety is further improved.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention has a small change in the crystal structure and a small difference in volume per the same number of transition metal atoms between a sufficiently discharging state and a high-voltage charging state.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the crystal structures of a positive electrode active material <b>904</b> before and after being charged and discharged. The positive electrode active material <b>904</b> is a composite oxide including lithium, cobalt, and oxygen. In addition to the above, the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> preferably includes magnesium. Furthermore, the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> preferably includes halogen such as fluorine or chlorine. The positive electrode active material <b>904</b> preferably contains aluminum and nickel.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The crystal structure with a charge depth of 0 (in the discharged state) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is R-3m (O3) as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Meanwhile, the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> with a charge depth in a sufficiently charged state includes a crystal whose structure is different from the H1-3 type structure (the space group R-3m) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This structure belongs to the space group R-3m, and is not a spinel crystal structure but a structure in which oxygen is hexacoordinated to ions of cobalt, magnesium, or the like and the cation arrangement has symmetry similar to that of the spinel crystal structure. Furthermore, the symmetry of CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers of this structure is the same as that in the O3 type structure. Accordingly, this structure is referred to as an O3&#x2032; type crystal structure or a pseudo-spinel crystal structure in this specification and the like. Note that although lithium exists in any of lithium sites at an approximately 20% probability in the diagram of the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the structure is not limited thereto. Lithium may exist in only some certain lithium sites. In addition, in both the O3 type crystal structure and the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure, a slight amount of magnesium preferably exists between the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers, i.e., in lithium sites. In addition, a slight amount of halogen such as fluorine preferably exists in oxygen sites at random.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Note that in the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure, oxygen is tetracoordinated to a light element such as lithium in some cases; also in that case, the ion arrangement has symmetry similar to that of the spinel structure.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The O3&#x2032; type crystal structure can also be regarded as a crystal structure that includes Li between layers at random but is similar to a CdCl<sub>2 </sub>type crystal structure. The crystal structure similar to the CdCl<sub>2 </sub>type crystal structure is close to a crystal structure of lithium nickel oxide when charged up to a charge depth of 0.94 (Li<sub>0.06</sub>NiO<sub>2</sub>); however, pure lithium cobalt oxide or a layered rock-salt positive electrode active material containing a large amount of cobalt is known not to have this crystal structure in general.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Anions of a layered rock-salt crystal and anions of a rock-salt crystal have a cubic close-packed structure (face-centered cubic lattice structure). Anions of an O3&#x2032; type crystal are also presumed to have a cubic close-packed structure. When the O3&#x2032; type crystal is in contact with the layered rock-salt crystal and the rock-salt crystal, there is a crystal plane at which orientations of cubic close-packed structures composed of anions are aligned. Note that a space group of the layered rock-salt crystal and the O3&#x2032; type crystal is R-3m, which is different from a space group Fm&#x2212;3m of a rock-salt crystal (a space group of a general rock-salt crystal) and a space group Fd&#x2212;3m of a rock-salt crystal (a space group of a rock-salt crystal having the simplest symmetry); thus, the Miller index of the crystal plane satisfying the above conditions in the layered rock-salt crystal and the O3&#x2032; type crystal is different from that in the rock-salt crystal. In this specification, a state where the orientations of the cubic close-packed structures composed of anions in the layered rock-salt crystal, the O3&#x2032; type crystal, and the rock-salt crystal are aligned is sometimes referred to as a state where crystal orientations are substantially aligned.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the positive electrode active material <b>904</b>, a change in the crystal structure when the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> is charged with high voltage and a large amount of lithium is extracted is inhibited as compared with a comparative example described later. As shown by dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers hardly deviate in the crystal structures.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">More specifically, the structure of the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> is highly stable even when a charge voltage is high. For example, an H1-3 type structure is formed at a voltage of approximately 4.6 V with the potential of a lithium metal as the reference in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; however, the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> can maintain the crystal structure of R-3m (O3) even at the voltage of approximately 4.6 V. Even at higher charge voltages, e.g., a voltage of approximately 4.65 V to 4.7 V with the potential of a lithium metal as the reference, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention can have the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure. At a charge voltage increased to be higher than 4.7 V, an H1-3 type crystal may be finally observed in the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention. In addition, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention might have the O3&#x2032; type structure even at a lower charge voltage (e.g., a charge voltage of greater than or equal to 4.5 V and less than 4.6 V with the potential of a lithium metal as the reference).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Note that in the case where graphite is used as a negative electrode active material in a secondary battery, for example, the voltage of the secondary battery is lower than the above-mentioned voltages by the potential of graphite. The potential of graphite is approximately 0.05 V to 0.2 V with the potential of a lithium metal as the reference. Thus, even in a secondary battery that includes graphite as a negative electrode active material and has a voltage of greater than or equal to 4.3 V and less than or equal to 4.5 V, for example, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention can maintain the crystal structure of R-3m (O3) and moreover, can have the O3&#x2032; type structure at higher voltages, e.g., a voltage of the secondary battery of greater than 4.5 V and less than or equal to 4.6 V. In addition, the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention can have the O3&#x2032; type structure at lower charge voltages, e.g., at a voltage of the secondary battery of greater than or equal to 4.2 V and less than 4.3 V, in some cases.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Thus, in the positive electrode active material <b>904</b>, the crystal structure is less likely to be broken even when charge and discharge are repeated at high voltage.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the positive electrode active material <b>904</b>, a difference in the volume per unit cell between the 03 type crystal structure with a charge depth of 0 and the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure with a charge depth of 0.8 is less than or equal to 2.5%, more specifically, less than or equal to 2.2%.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the unit cell of the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure, coordinates of cobalt and oxygen can be represented by Co (0, 0, 0.5) and O (0, 0, x) within the range of 0.20&#x2264;x&#x2264;0.25.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A slight amount of additive substances, such as magnesium, existing between the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers, i.e., in lithium sites at random, has an effect of inhibiting a deviation in the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers in high-voltage charging. Thus, when magnesium exists between the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers, the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure is likely to be formed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">However, cation mixing occurs when the heat treatment temperature is excessively high, so that magnesium is highly likely to enter the cobalt sites. Magnesium in the cobalt sites is less effective in maintaining the R-3m structure in high-voltage charging in some cases. Furthermore, when the heat treatment temperature is excessively high, adverse effects such as reduction of cobalt to have a valence of two and transpiration of lithium are concerned.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In view of the above, a halogen compound such as a fluorine compound is preferably added to lithium cobalt oxide before the heat treatment for distributing magnesium over whole particles. The addition of the halogen compound depresses the melting point of lithium cobalt oxide. The depression of the melting point makes it easier to distribute magnesium over whole particles at a temperature at which the cation mixing is unlikely to occur. Furthermore, it is expected that the existence of the fluorine compound can improve corrosion resistance to hydrofluoric acid generated by decomposition of an electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the magnesium concentration is higher than a predetermined value, the effect of stabilizing a crystal structure becomes small in some cases. This is probably because magnesium enters the cobalt sites in addition to the lithium sites. The number of magnesium atoms in the positive electrode active material formed by one embodiment of the present invention is preferably 0.001 times or more and 0.1 times or less, further preferably more than 0.01 times and less than 0.04 times, still further preferably approximately 0.02 times as large as the number of cobalt atoms. The magnesium concentration described here may be a value obtained by element analysis on the entire particles of the positive electrode active material using ICP-MS or the like, or may be a value based on the ratio of the raw materials mixed in the forming process of the positive electrode active material, for example.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The number of nickel atoms in the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> is preferably 7.5% or lower, preferably 0.05% or higher and 4% or lower, further preferably 0.1% or higher and 2% or lower of the number of cobalt atoms. The nickel concentration described here may be a value obtained by element analysis on the entire particle of the positive electrode active material using ICP-MS or the like, or may be a value based on the ratio of the raw materials mixed in the forming process of the positive electrode active material, for example.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Particle Size&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A too large particle size of the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> causes problems such as difficulty in lithium diffusion and too much surface roughness of an active material layer in coating to a current collector. By contrast, a too small particle size causes problems such as difficulty in carrying the active material layer in coating to the current collector and overreaction with an electrolyte solution. Therefore, an average particle diameter (D50, also referred to as median diameter) is preferably more than or equal to 1 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 100 &#x3bc;m, further preferably more than or equal to 2 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 40 &#x3bc;m, still further preferably more than or equal to 5 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 30 &#x3bc;m.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">&#x3c;Analysis Method&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Whether or not a positive electrode active material has the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure when charged with high voltage can be determined by analyzing a high-voltage charged positive electrode using XRD, electron diffraction, neutron diffraction, electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), or the like. The XRD is particularly preferable because the symmetry of a transition metal such as cobalt contained in the positive electrode active material can be analyzed with high resolution, the degrees of crystallinity and the crystal orientations can be compared, the distortion of lattice periodicity and the crystallite size can be analyzed, and a positive electrode obtained by disassembling a secondary battery can be measured without any change with sufficient accuracy, for example.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As described so far, the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> has a feature of a small change in the crystal structure between the high-voltage charged state and the discharged state. A material where 50 wt % or more of the crystal structure largely changes between the high-voltage charged state and the discharged state is not preferable because the material cannot withstand the high-voltage charge and discharge. In addition, it should be noted that an objective crystal structure is not obtained in some cases only by addition of impurity elements. For example, although the positive electrode active material that is lithium cobaltate containing magnesium and fluorine is a commonality, the positive electrode active material has 60 wt % or more of the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure in some cases, and has 50 wt % or more of the H1-3 type crystal structure in other cases, when charged with a high voltage. Furthermore, at a predetermined voltage, the positive electrode active material has almost 100 wt % of the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure, and with an increase in the predetermined voltage, the H1-3 type crystal structure is generated in some cases. Thus, the crystal structure of the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> is preferably analyzed by XRD or the like. The combination of the analysis methods and measurement such as XRD enables more detail analysis.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Note that a positive electrode active material in the high-voltage charged state or the discharged state sometimes causes a change in the crystal structure when exposed to air. For example, the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure changes into the H1-3 type crystal structure in some cases. Thus, all samples are preferably handled in an inert atmosphere such as an atmosphere including argon.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A positive electrode active material illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) to which halogen or magnesium is not added in a manufacturing method described later. The crystal structure of the lithium cobalt oxide illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is changed depending on a charge depth.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, lithium cobalt oxide with a charge depth of 0 (discharged state) includes a region having a crystal structure of the space group R-3m, and includes three CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers in a unit cell. Thus, this crystal structure is referred to as an O3 type crystal structure in some cases. Note that the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layer has a structure in which octahedral geometry with oxygen hexacoordinated to cobalt continues on a plane in the edge-sharing state.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the charge depth is 1, LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>has the crystal structure of the space group P&#x2212;3m1, and one CoO<sub>2 </sub>layer exists in a unit cell. Thus, this crystal structure is referred to as an O1 type crystal structure in some cases.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, lithium cobalt oxide with a charge depth of approximately 0.8 has the crystal structure of the space group R-3m. This structure can also be regarded as a structure in which CoO<sub>2 </sub>structures such as P-3m1 (O1) and LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>structures such as R-3m (O3) are alternately stacked. Thus, this crystal structure is referred to as an H1-3 type crystal structure in some cases. Note that the number of cobalt atoms per unit cell in the actual H1-3 type crystal structure is twice as large as that of cobalt atoms per unit cell in other structures. However, in this specification including <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the c-axis of the H1-3 type crystal structure is half that of the unit cell for easy comparison with the other structures.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For the H1-3 type crystal structure, the coordinates of cobalt and oxygen in the unit cell can be expressed as follows, for example: Co (0, 0, 0.42150&#xb1;0.00016), O<sub>1 </sub>(0, 0, 0.27671&#xb1;0.00045), and O<sub>2 </sub>(0, 0, 0.11535&#xb1;0.00045). O<sub>1 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>are each an oxygen atom. In this manner, the H1-3 type crystal structure is represented by a unit cell including one cobalt and two oxygen. Meanwhile, the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure of one embodiment of the present invention is preferably represented by a unit cell including one cobalt and one oxygen. This means that the symmetry of cobalt and oxygen differs between the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure and the H1-3 type structure, and the amount of change from the O3 structure is smaller in the O3&#x2032; type crystal structure than in the H1-3 type structure. A preferred unit cell for representing a crystal structure in a positive electrode active material is selected such that the value of GOF (good of fitness) is smaller in the Rietveld analysis of XRD, for example.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">When charge with a high voltage of 4.6 V or higher based on the redox potential of a lithium metal or charge with a large charge depth of 0.8 or more and discharge are repeated, the crystal structure of lithium cobalt oxide changes (i.e., an unbalanced phase change occurs) repeatedly between the H1-3 type crystal structure and the R-3m (O3) structure in a discharged state.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">However, there is a large deviation in the position of the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layer between these two crystal structures. As indicated by dotted lines and an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the CoO<sub>2 </sub>layer in the H1-3 type crystal structure greatly shifts from that in the R-3m (O3) structure. Such a dynamic structural change might adversely affect the stability of the crystal structure.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A difference in volume is also large. The H1-3 type crystal structure and the O3 type crystal structure in a discharged state that contain the same number of cobalt atoms have a difference in volume of 3.0% or more.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In addition, a structure in which CoO<sub>2 </sub>layers are continuous, such as P-3m1 (O1), included in the H1-3 type crystal structure is highly likely to be unstable.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, the repeated high-voltage charge and discharge break the crystal structure of lithium cobalt oxide. The break of the crystal structure degrades the cycle performance. This is probably because the break of the crystal structure reduces sites where lithium can stably exist and makes it difficult to insert and extract lithium.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, the behavior of elements such as magnesium, fluorine, nickel, aluminum, and titanium in the positive electrode active material of one embodiment of the present invention was examined by quantum molecular dynamics calculation and first principles calculation.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">&#x3c;Quantum Molecular Dynamics 1&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The stability of the structure of LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>from which lithium in lithium layers was removed was examined by quantum molecular dynamics calculation, in which a structure where an atom was newly placed in the lithium layer and a structure where another atom was substituted for a Co atom in a CoO<sub>2 </sub>layer were each used as the initial state.

For example, when analyzed with a glow discharge mass spectroscopy method, the total impurity concentration is preferably less than or equal to 10,000 wt ppm, further preferably less than or equal to 5,000 wt ppm.

Although the mixing can be performed by a dry process or a wet process, the wet process is preferable because the materials can be ground to a smaller size. When the mixing is performed by a wet method, a solvent is prepared. As the solvent, ketone such as acetone, alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol, ether, dioxane, acetonitrile, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or the like can be used. An aprotic solvent that hardly reacts with lithium is further preferably used. In this embodiment, acetone is used.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0151">For example, a ball mill, a bead mill, or the like can be used for the mixing. When the ball mill is used, a zirconia ball can be used as media, for example. The mixing and grinding steps are preferably performed sufficiently to pulverize a mixture <b>903</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0152">The materials mixed and ground in the above manner are collected (Step S<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>), whereby the mixture <b>903</b> is obtained (Step S<b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0153">For example, the D50 of the mixture <b>903</b> is preferably greater than or equal to 600 nm and less than or equal to 20 &#x3bc;m, further preferably greater than or equal to 1 &#x3bc;m and less than or equal to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0154">Then, the mixture <b>903</b> is heated (Step S<b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). This step is referred to as annealing in some cases. LiMO<sub>2 </sub>is produced by the annealing. Thus, the conditions of performing Step S<b>16</b>, such as temperature, time, an atmosphere, or weight of the mixture <b>903</b> to be annealed, are important. The meaning of annealing in this specification, includes a case where the mixture <b>903</b> is heated and a case where a heating furnace in which at least the mixture <b>903</b> is placed is heated. The heating furnace in this specification is equipment used for performing heat treatment (annealing) on a substance or a mixture and includes a heater unit, an atmosphere including a fluoride, and an inner wall that can withstand at least 600&#xb0; C. Furthermore, the heating furnace may be provided with a pump having a function of reducing and/or increasing the inside pressure of the heating furnace. For example, pressure may be applied during the annealing in S<b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0155">The annealing temperature in S<b>16</b> is further preferably higher than or equal to the temperature at which the mixture <b>903</b> melts. The annealing temperature needs to be lower than or equal to a decomposition temperature of LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>(1130&#xb0; C.). Since the decomposition temperature of LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is 1130&#xb0; C., decomposition of a slight amount of LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is concerned at a temperature close to the decomposition temperature. Thus, the annealing temperature is preferably lower than or equal to 1130&#xb0; C., and is lower than or equal to 1000&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0156">LiF is used as the fluoride <b>902</b> and the annealing in S<b>16</b> is conducted with the lid put on, whereby the positive electrode active material <b>904</b> with favorable cycle characteristics and the like can be manufactured. It is considered that when LiF and MgF<sub>2 </sub>are used as the fluoride <b>902</b>, the reaction with LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is promoted with the annealing temperature in S<b>16</b> set to be higher than or equal to 742&#xb0; C. to generate LiMO<sub>2 </sub>because the eutectic point of LiF and MgF<sub>2 </sub>is around 742&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0157">Furthermore, an endothermic peak of LiF, MgF<sub>2</sub>, and LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>is observed at around 820&#xb0; C. by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC measurement). Thus, the annealing temperature is preferably higher than or equal to 742&#xb0; C., further preferably higher than or equal to 820&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0158">Accordingly, the annealing temperature is preferably higher than or equal to 742&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 1130&#xb0; C., further preferably higher than or equal to 742&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 1000&#xb0; C. Moreover, the annealing temperature is preferably higher than or equal to 820&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 1130&#xb0; C., further preferably higher than or equal to 820&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 1000&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0159">In this embodiment, LiF, which is a fluoride, is considered to function as flux. Accordingly, since the capacity of the heating furnace is larger than the capacity of the container and LiF is lighter than oxygen, it is expected that LiF is volatilized and the reduction of LiF in the mixture <b>903</b> inhibits production of LiMO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, heating needs to be performed while volatilization of LiF is inhibited.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0160">Thus, when the mixture <b>903</b> is heated in an atmosphere including LiF, that is, the mixture <b>903</b> is heated in a state where the partial pressure of LiF in the heating furnace is high, volatilization of LiF in the mixture <b>903</b> is inhibited. By performing annealing using the fluoride (LiF or MgF) to form an eutectic mixture with the lid put on, the annealing temperature can be lowered to the decomposition temperature of the LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>(1130&#xb0; C.) or lower, specifically, a temperature higher than or equal to 742&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 1000&#xb0; C., thereby enabling the production of LiMO<sub>2 </sub>to progress efficiently. Accordingly, a positive electrode active material having favorable characteristics can be formed, and the annealing time can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates an example of the annealing method in S<b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0162">A heating furnace <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> includes a space <b>102</b> in the heating furnace, a hot plate <b>104</b>, a heater unit <b>106</b>, and a heat insulator <b>108</b>. It is further preferable to put a lid <b>118</b> on a container <b>116</b> in annealing. With this structure, an atmosphere including a fluoride can be obtained in a space <b>119</b> enclosed by the container <b>116</b> and the lid <b>118</b>. In the annealing, the state of the space <b>119</b> is maintained with the lid put on so that the concentration of the gasified fluoride inside the space <b>119</b> can be constant or cannot be reduced, in which case fluorine or magnesium can be contained in the vicinity of the particle surface or in a surface portion of the particle. The atmosphere including a fluoride can be provided in the space <b>119</b>, which is smaller in capacity than the space <b>102</b> in the heating furnace, by volatilization of a smaller amount of a fluoride. This means that an atmosphere including a fluoride can be provided in the reaction system without a significant reduction in the amount of a fluoride included in the mixture <b>903</b>. Accordingly, LiMO<sub>2 </sub>can be produced efficiently. In addition, the use of the lid <b>118</b> allows the annealing of the mixture <b>903</b> in an atmosphere including a fluoride to be simply and inexpensively performed.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0163">Furthermore, the fluoride or the like attached to inner walls of the container <b>116</b> and the lid <b>118</b> is likely to be fluttered again by the heating and attached to the mixture <b>903</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0164">Here, the valence number of Co (cobalt) in LiMO<sub>2 </sub>formed by one embodiment of the present invention is preferably approximately 3.

The steps in this order enable the mixture <b>903</b> to be annealed in an atmosphere including oxygen and a fluoride. During the annealing, the space <b>102</b> in the heating furnace is preferably sealed to prevent any gas from being discharged to the outside.

In particular, introducing an oxygen gas after exhausting air from the space <b>102</b> in the heating furnace (oxygen displacement) is preferred.

When a secondary battery using lithium is regarded as a closed circuit, lithium ions transfer and a current flows in the same direction. Note that in a secondary battery using lithium, the anode and the cathode are interchanged in charging and discharging, and the oxidation reaction and the reduction reaction are interchanged; thus, an electrode with a high reaction potential is called the positive electrode and an electrode with a low reaction potential is called the negative electrode. For this reason, in this specification, the positive electrode is referred to as a &#x201c;positive electrode&#x201d; or a &#x201c;plus electrode&#x201d; and the negative electrode is referred to as a &#x201c;negative electrode&#x201d; or a &#x201c;minus electrode&#x201d; in all the cases where charge is performed, discharge is performed, a reverse pulse current is supplied, and a charge current is supplied. The use of terms such as anode and cathode related to oxidation reaction and reduction reaction might cause confusion because the anode and the cathode are reversed in charging and in discharging. Thus, the terms such as anode and cathode are not used in this specification. If the term such as an anode or a cathode is used, whether it is at the time of charge or discharge is noted and whether it corresponds to a positive electrode or a negative electrode is also noted.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0212">Two terminals illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref> are connected to a charger, and the secondary battery <b>300</b> is charged.

The positive electrode active material layer <b>414</b> may also include a conductive material and a binder. As the conductive material, a carbon material such as carbon black (e.g., AB), graphite (black lead) particles, carbon nanotubes (CNT), or fullerene can be used. Alternatively, metal powder or metal fibers of copper, nickel, aluminum, silver, gold, or the like, a conductive ceramic material, or the like can be used. Alternatively, a graphene compound may be used as the conductive material. A graphene compound has excellent electrical characteristics of high conductivity and excellent physical properties of high flexibility and high mechanical strength in some cases. A graphene compound has a planar shape. A graphene compound enables low-resistance surface contact. Furthermore, a graphene compound has extremely high conductivity even with a small thickness in some cases and thus allows a conductive path to be formed in an active material layer efficiently even with a small amount. Hence, a graphene compound is preferably used as a conductive additive, in which case the area where the active material and the conductive additive are in contact with each other can be increased. In addition, a graphene compound is preferable because electrical resistance can be reduced in some cases. Here, examples of the graphene compound include graphene, multilayer graphene, multi graphene, graphene oxide, multilayer graphene oxide, multi graphene oxide, graphene oxide that is reduced, multilayer graphene oxide that is reduced, multi graphene oxide that is reduced, and graphene quantum dots. The graphene oxide that is reduced is also referred to as reduced graphene oxide (hereinafter RGO). Note that RGO refers to a compound obtained by reducing graphene oxide (GO), for example. In the case where an active material particle with a small particle diameter, e.g., 1 &#x3bc;m or less, is used, the specific surface area of the active material particle is large and thus more conductive paths for connecting the active material particles are needed. In such a case, a graphene compound that can efficiently form a conductive path even in a small amount is particularly preferably used. In this specification and the like, graphene oxide contains carbon and oxygen, has a sheet-like shape, and includes a functional group, in particular, an epoxy group, a carboxy group, or a hydroxy group.

The graphene net covering the active material can function as a binder for bonding active materials. The amount of binder can thus be reduced, or the binder does not have to be used.
