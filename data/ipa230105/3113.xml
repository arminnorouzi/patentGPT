However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.)</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology. Rather, the use of ordinal numbers is to distinguish between the elements. By way of an example, a first element is distinct from a second element, and the first element may encompass more than one element and succeed (or precede) the second element in an ordering of elements.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, embodiments of the disclosure include systems and methods for predicting caliper log data using a descaling model. To illustrate the problem of scaling in the oil and gas industry, scales on well components may be a problem of production flow assurance. Iron sulfide scaling, for example, may result from the presence of iron and hydrogen sulfide in sour oil and gas wells. Thus, some embodiments include using a descaling model to predict the outcome of one or more scale treatments for addressing different types of scaling, such as iron sulfide scaling. More specifically, caliper log data may be acquired in a wellbore for a well of interest, where the caliper log data may be input to the descaling model in order to simulate or predict values of the well after a scale treatment. In other words, a caliper logging tool may obtain radius values inside a well tubular for a scaled joint, which may be subsequently used to determine characteristics of the descaled joint (e.g., resulting thickness and other physical dimensions, maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) values, etc.) after a scale treatment. Using this predicted scale treatment knowledge, a control system or other well managing system may determine whether to perform a particular scale treatment or proceed with a well intervention operation to workover (e.g., replace) the well tubulars with the scaled joints. Example of well tubulars may include casings in a well as well as production tubing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, a descaling model may be a linear regression model that generates virtual caliper logs or merely individual predicted caliper log values. These virtual caliper logs may be synthetic data that are used to predict new tubing thicknesses after descaling. Accordingly, a predicted descaled well may be analyzed for various predetermined criteria, such as a new maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) on well tubing. If this new MAOP value is out of range from a recommended rating, a tubing replacement may be selected over a scale treatment in order to maintain tubing integrity.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram in accordance with one or more embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a well environment (<b>100</b>) that may include a well (<b>102</b>) having a wellbore (<b>104</b>) extending into a formation (<b>106</b>). The wellbore (<b>104</b>) may include a bored hole that extends from the surface into a target zone of the formation (<b>106</b>), such as a reservoir. The formation (<b>106</b>) may include various formation characteristics of interest, such as formation porosity, formation permeability, resistivity, density, water saturation, and the like. The well environment (<b>100</b>) may include a drilling system (<b>110</b>), a logging system (<b>112</b>), a control system (<b>114</b>), and a simulator (<b>160</b>). The drilling system (<b>110</b>) may include a drill string, drill bit, a mud circulation system and/or the like for use in boring the wellbore (<b>104</b>) into the formation (<b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The control system (<b>114</b>) may include hardware and/or software for managing drilling operations, maintenance operations, and/or well intervention operations. For example, the control system (<b>114</b>) may include one or more programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that include hardware and/or software with functionality to control one or more processes performed by the drilling system (<b>110</b>). Specifically, a programmable logic controller may control valve states, fluid levels, pipe pressures, warning alarms, and/or pressure releases throughout a drilling rig. In particular, a programmable logic controller may be a ruggedized computer system with functionality to withstand vibrations, extreme temperatures, wet conditions, and/or dusty conditions, for example, around a drilling rig. Thus, controls systems may be used to perform various well operations, such as drilling operations, well completion operations, well intervention operations, and well maintenance operations.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The logging system (<b>112</b>) may include one or more logging tools (<b>113</b>), such as a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging tool and/or a resistivity logging tool, for use in generating well logs (<b>140</b>) of the formation (<b>106</b>) and/or well components in the wellbore (<b>104</b>), such as casings, production tubing, or other well tubulars. For example, a logging tool may be lowered into the wellbore (<b>104</b>) to acquire measurements as the tool traverses a depth interval (<b>130</b>) (e.g., a targeted reservoir section) of the wellbore (<b>104</b>). The plot of the logging measurements versus depth may be referred to as a &#x201c;log&#x201d; or &#x201c;well log&#x201d;. Well logs (<b>104</b>) may provide depth measurements of the well (<b>102</b>) that describe such reservoir characteristics as formation porosity, formation permeability, resistivity, density, borehole or tubular sizes, water saturation, and the like. The resulting logging measurements may be stored and/or processed, for example, by the control system (<b>114</b>), to generate corresponding well logs (<b>140</b>) for the well (<b>102</b>). A well log may include, for example, a plot of a logging response time versus true vertical depth (TVD) across the depth interval (<b>130</b>) of the wellbore (<b>104</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the one or more logging tools (<b>113</b>) includes a caliper logging tool. For example, a caliper logging tool may include hardware to determine a diameter of a borehole along its depth. In particular, a caliper logging tool may measure variation in borehole diameters as the logging tool is withdrawn from the bottom of a borehole, using two or more articulated arms that push against the borehole wall. An articulated arm may be connected to a potentiometer that causes resistance to change as the diameter of the borehole changes, resulting in varying electrical signals that correspond to changes to diameter. After calibration, the caliper logging tool may generate a caliper log that is printed as a continuous series of hole diameter values or radius values with respect to depth.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, some caliper logging tools may use electromagnetic techniques or acoustic techniques to determine diameter sizes. For electromagnetic sensing techniques, a caliper logging tool may include a coil centered inside a tubular that generates an alternating magnetic field and another coil farther up the logging tool that measures phase shift introduced by the tubular. For acoustic sensing techniques, a caliper logging tool may include a transducer that detects a high-frequency pulse reflected from a tubular or a borehole wall back to the transducer. As such, a diameter measurement may be determined from the time of flight of this reflected wave and a fluid's acoustic velocity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, a caliper logging tool is a multifinger caliper. For an irregularly-shaped wellbore, a multifinger caliper may simultaneously determine diameters at several different locations. Within casing pipe and using a large number of arms (also called &#x201c;fingers&#x201d;), the caliper logging tool may detect small changes in the wall of the pipe. For illustration purposes, a multifinger caliper may have between 20 and 80 fingers (in comparison to caliper logging tools with 2 or 4 fingers), where such larger numbers of fingers may be used in larger pipes. Thus, a caliper logging tool may detect deformations, scale buildup, and/or metal loss due to corrosion. In some embodiments, a caliper logging tool is a smart caliper tool. For example, a caliper logging tool may generate a caliper log during a measurement-while-drilling (MWD) operation. A smart caliper tool may use ultrasonic caliper measurement techniques to account for bottom-hole assembly (BHA) placement and changes in fluid density. As such, a smart caliper tool may include hardware for onboard calibration and multiple sensors that allow 360&#xb0; mapping of a wellbore or tubular shape.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, scales may form within one or more tube sections of the wellbore (<b>104</b>). For example, a scale may be a mineral deposit that occurs on wellbore tubulars (e.g., casing, production tubulars, etc.) and other well components due to exposure of well fluids, changing temperatures, and different pressure conditions in the production conduit. The formation of scale may affect the performance of downhole tools such as artificial lift equipment. In addition, scales may interfere with the safe operation of pipeline valve systems and rapidly erodes surface chokes because of the high erosion rate when certain chemical compositions flow with a production stream. Thus, scales may result in restrictions, or even a plug, within a wellbore tubular and other well equipment. Examples of different scaling types include iron sulfide scaling (e.g., that results in iron sulfide or iron oxide deposits), carbonate scaling (e.g., resulting in calcium carbonate or calcite deposits), sulfate scaling (e.g., resulting in gypsum or anhydrite deposits), silica scaling (e.g., resulting chalcedony or amorphous opal deposits), and/or chloride scaling (e.g., resulting in sodium chloride deposits).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">To remove scales, one or more well intervention operations may be performed in the wellbore (<b>104</b>). Where iron sulfide scales precipitate in a production well or a water injection well, for example, iron sulfide scales may be removed with a chemical scale treatment, such as a treatment that uses hydrochlroric acid in conjunction with sequestering or reducing agents to dissolve the scales. For chemical scale treatments, different solvents may be used depending on the type of scale. In particular, carbonate scales may also be dissolved using hydrochloric acid at specific temperatures, while sulfate scales may be removed using ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. Chloride scales may be eliminated using fresh water or weak acidic solutions, such as solutions that include acetic acid. Silica scaling that is associated with steam flooding operations may be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Scale treatments may also include mechanical treatments. In some embodiments, for example, coil tubing (CT) milling and high-pressure rotary jetting tools are used to remove scales. Abrasive jetting may cut scales while leaves a corresponding well tubular undamaged. A well intervention operation for a mechanical treatment may use various deployment mechanisms, such as a derrick or a coiled tubing truck to implement a workstring for performing the mechanical treatment within a well. In some embodiments, both chemical and mechanical treatments are used to remove scales (e.g., for iron sulfide scaling, a hydrochloric acid treatment may be used to remove FeS, while a mechanical treatment may be used to remove FeS<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some well intervention operations also include scale-inhibition treatments. More specifically, a scale-inhibition treatment may include applying a chemical inhibitor into a water-producing zone for subsequent commingling with produced fluids, thereby preventing scale precipitation. Scale inhibitors may include various chemicals that delay, reduce and/or prevent scale deposition, such as acrylic acid polymers, maleic acid polymers, and phosphonates. In some embodiments, scale-inhibition treatments are performed using continuous injection into a wellbore via a tubing string that may reach various well perforations or injection into a gas lift system. Likewise, a scale inhibitor may be disposed in a rathole (i.e., an additional hole drilled at the end of the well beyond a final zone of interest) to implement a slow dissolution of the scale inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to simulator (<b>160</b>), a simulator (<b>160</b>) may include hardware and/or software with functionality for storing and analyzing well logs (<b>140</b>), such as caliper logs, to generate and/or update one or more descaling models (<b>170</b>). While the simulator (<b>160</b>) is shown at a well site, in some embodiments, the simulator (<b>160</b>) may be remote from a well site. In some embodiments, the simulator (<b>160</b>) is implemented as part of a software platform for the control system (<b>114</b>). The software platform may obtain data acquired by the drilling system (<b>110</b>) and logging system (<b>112</b>) as inputs, which may include multiple data types from multiple sources. The software platform may aggregate the data from these systems (<b>110</b>, <b>112</b>) in real time for rapid analysis. In some embodiments, the control system (<b>114</b>), the logging system (<b>112</b>), and/or the simulator (<b>160</b>) may include a computer system that is similar to the computer system (<b>602</b>) described below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, a descaling model (e.g., one of the descaling models (<b>170</b>)) is used to predict results of a scale treatment in a well. For example, a descaling model may be a linear regression model that predicts inner diameters of a tubular following a predetermined scale treatment. In some embodiments, a descaling model uses acquired caliper logs to produce a virtual caliper log or synthetic caliper log prior to actual performance of a descaling job. Thus, a descaling model may be an algorithmic model that may include functionality for determining the success or failure of a particular scale treatment. In some embodiments, a descaling model is a machine-learning model that is trained to predict caliper log values. Examples of machine-learning models include convolutional neural networks, deep neural networks, recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, inductive learning models, deductive learning models, supervised learning models, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a control system (<b>114</b>) may communicate commands to one or more well systems based on caliper log data and a descaling model (e.g., one of the descaling models (<b>170</b>)). For example, the control system (<b>114</b>) may generate one or more control signals for positioning a workstring in the wellbore (<b>104</b>) or a jetting tool at a downhole end for cleaning operations. Likewise, a simulator (<b>160</b>) may communicate replacement operations or scale treatment operations to one or more control systems based on predicted caliper log values from one or more descaling models. For example, in response to a simulator (<b>160</b>) determining that a descaling treatment satisfies one or more predetermined criteria, a control system may implement the respective scale treatment. In contrast, where the simulator (<b>160</b>) determines that a scale treatment fails to satisfy a predetermined criterion, a control system may select a different scale treatment or a tubular replacement. Upon determining well tubular(s) that require replacement, casing or a production tubular may be removed from the wellbore (<b>104</b>) and a new tubular inserted accordingly. Depending on the type of well tubular, a cementing operation may be performed that includes pumping cement slurry into the wellbore (<b>104</b>) to displace existing well fluid and fill space between the well tubular and the untreated sides of the wellbore (<b>104</b>). Thus, a control system may transmit commands to mixers and storage tanks for managing cement slurry (e.g., a mixture of various additives and cement) for a corresponding well intervention operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows various configurations of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the disclosure.

Furthermore, the blocks may be performed actively or passively.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In Block <b>200</b>, caliper log data are obtained regarding a well in accordance with one or more embodiments. For example, caliper log data may be obtained from various databases, preprocessed, and/or formatted for further analysis. In some embodiments, caliper log data correspond to one or more well logs that are acquired using a caliper logging tool, such as a multifinger caliper tool. For more information on caliper logging tools, see caliper logs and caliper loggings tools described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the accompanying description.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In Block <b>205</b>, a descaling model is obtained for a scale treatment in accordance with one or more embodiments. In some embodiments, a descaling model may be a model for a well or an oil and gas field that describes the effect of one or more scale treatments based on input caliper log data. For example, caliper logs may be acquired frequently in some wells to identify tubing scale obstructions and following scale treatments. As such, a descaling model may use caliper log data to predict the properties of scaled joints following a scale treatment, such as inner diameter values or radius values. In other words, a descaling model may output various values relating to a respective joint after descaling, e.g., a minimum radius value, a maximum radius value, and an average radius value. Likewise, multiple descaling models may be used for different scale treatments and/or different types of wells. For example, scale composition may be dependent on a specific reservoir type or well type. In some embodiments, a descaling model is further calibrated to a predetermined accuracy (e.g., accurate above 80%).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, a descaling model may be a regression model that is generated using a linear regression analysis. In some embodiments, for example, a descaling model is expressed using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Y=&#x221d;+&#x3b2;</i><sub>1</sub><i>X</i><sub>1</sub>+&#x3b2;<sub>2</sub><i>X</i><sub>2</sub>+&#x3b2;<sub>3</sub><i>X</i><sub>3</sub>+&#x3f5;&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0037" num="0000">where Y is the response variable, such as an average radius postscale treatment, &#x221d; is an intercept term, X<sub>1,2,3 </sub>are explanatory variables or predictor variables (e.g., maximum radius, minimum radius, and average radius), &#x3b2;<sub>1,2,3 </sub>correspond to various slopes that indicate an increase or decreasing associated with a single unit increase in the explanatory variables, and &#x3f5; is a random error term. Thus, a descaling model similar to Equation 1 may be generated using caliper log data from various wells.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides an example of a descaling model in accordance with one or more embodiments. The following example is for explanatory purposes only and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosed technology. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, descaling model A is a regression model based on a 4.5&#x2033; tubing size for iron sulfide scaling. In some embodiments, descaling models are generated for different tubing sizes, such that different types of well tubulars may experience different results from scale treatments. To generate the descaling model A, caliper log data is obtained for various scaled wells with a similar well tubular. Thus, this caliper log data correspond to data that describes both the scaled wells before and after the particular scale treatment. Using this caliper log data, the descaling model A is generated using the variables that are available from backward selection. Next, a p-value is used to select variables that have stronger relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable. In other words, the p-value may test a null hypothesis such that a coefficient equal to zero has no effect. In other words, a low p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) may indicate that a null hypothesis can be rejected (i.e., a predictor variable with a low p-value is a meaningful addition to a descaling model), while a predictor variable with a high p-value is a statistically insignificant addition because a high p-value suggests that changes in a predictor variable are independent of changes in a response variable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">Accordingly, a variable selection method for descaling model A may achieve an objective of forming a model that predicts an average inner diameter of joints following a scale treatment. Finally, caliper log data is calibrated in order to select relevant caliper measurements at different joints. Thus, data calibration may provide the best predictors of inner diameters following a scale treatment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, more than 1200 depth points are used to fit the descaling model A to caliper log data with a total of 14884 data points. After a history matching calibration, the descaling model A predicted 92% of 650 data point within 10% accuracy as illustrated in the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The descaling model A may include the following coefficients based on a linear regression analysis: an intercept value of 2.922307755, a pre-treatment maximum radius value of &#x2212;0.02928276, a pre-treatment minimum radius value of &#x2212;0.056929242, and a pre-treatment average radius value of &#x2212;0.390300302. For example, these coefficients may correspond to the a value and the &#x3b2;<sub>1,2,3 </sub>values in Equation 1 above, respectively. p Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in Block <b>210</b>, various predicted caliper log values are determined for a descaled well using caliper log data and a descaling model in accordance with one or more embodiments. In particular, the descaled well may be a predicted well based on the well in Block <b>200</b> e.g., where values for the predicted well are determined using one or more descaling models. Thus, the descaled well may described a prediction of values that may exist for a well following one or more scale treatments. After obtaining a descaling model, for example, pre-treatment caliper log data may be input for various scaled joints that are targeted for scale removal. Thus, the output of the descaled model may include various predicted caliper log values for the same joints. In some embodiments, a descaling model outputs other types of scale treatment information instead of predicted caliper log values, e.g., whether the descaled joint passes a pressure burst criterion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">Moreover, the predicted caliper log values may be presented in a log visualization tool, such as one implemented using a graphical user interface within a user device. For example, a simulator may generate a synthetic or virtual caliper log for a particular well that describes the results of a scale treatment. However, the predicted caliper log values may also be merely measurement values (e.g., minimum radius value, maximum radius value, average radius value, etc.) in a table or other format that are used for further processing by a simulator.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">In Block <b>220</b>, a determination is made whether a descaled well satisfies a predetermined criterion in accordance with one or embodiments. More specifically, various predicted caliper log values may be used in a tubing condition evaluation after de-scaling. Examples of predetermined criteria for a well tubular may include pipe pressure thresholds, physical dimensions (e.g., is the change in well tubular thickness sufficient for a desired purpose, such as a specific well integrity), changes in well productivity (e.g., does the resulting thickness after a scale treatment increase well productivity beyond a desired amount additional productivity), etc. For example, the predetermined criterion may correspond to a pressure rating of one or more well tubulars within the descaled well. In some embodiments, for example, a simulator updates a maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) for one or more joints among various well tubulars. Where the predicted descaled well satisfies the predetermined criterion, this process may proceed to Block <b>230</b>. Where the predicted descaled well fails to satisfy the predetermined criterion, this process may proceed to Block <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">In some embodiments, a predetermined criterion may be based on post-treatment radius of one or more well tubulars. For example, a predicted radius value may be converted to a thickness measurement using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Thickness</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mo>(</mo>        <mrow>         <mi>average</mi>         <mo>&#x2062;</mo>         <mtext>   </mtext>         <mi>radius</mi>         <mo>*</mo>         <mn>2</mn>        </mrow>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mi>OD</mi>      </mrow>      <mn>2</mn>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>2</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0044" num="0000">where the average radius corresponds to a value at a predetermined well location and OD corresponds to an outer diameter value of a particular well tubular. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a virtual caliper log is illustrated that describes various wellbore thicknesses between predicted caliper log values and acquired caliper log data.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">In some embodiments, a burst pressure is determined using one or more thickness values of one or more well tubulars. A burst pressure value may correspond to a mechanical strength limit of a well tubular, where the burst pressure may identify a pressure that exceeds the tensile strength of a tubing material. Thus, a burst pressure may be determined based on a tensile strength of a tubing polymer as well as the tubing wall thickness value (e.g., the thickness value determined in Equation 2 above). In some embodiments, burst pressure is determined using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>P</mi>      <mi>b</mi>     </msub>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mn>0</mn>       <mo>.</mo>       <mn>8</mn>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mn>7</mn>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mn>5</mn>      <mo>*</mo>      <mfrac>       <mrow>        <mn>2</mn>        <mo>*</mo>        <msub>         <mi>Y</mi>         <mi>p</mi>        </msub>        <mo>*</mo>        <mi>t</mi>       </mrow>       <mi>D</mi>      </mfrac>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>Equation</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mtext>   </mtext>     <mn>3</mn>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0047" num="0000">where P<sub>b </sub>corresponds to a minimum internal yield pressure (e.g., as measured in psi), Y<sub>p </sub>corresponds to a minimum yield strength (e.g., as measured in psi), t corresponds to a nominal wall thickness (e.g., in inches), and D corresponds to a nominal outside diameter of the pipe (e.g., in inches). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a comparison is illustrated that shows burst pressure values from predicted data and burst pressures obtained from acquired data. The lowest measured burst pressure may be set as a new maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) for a well. Thus, MAOP values may differ between a well analyzed with a caliper logging tool and the same well after a descaling treatment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0041">Furthermore, some embodiments may automate a decision-making process for performing and analyzing descaling jobs on one or more wells. A simulator may determine which descaling tasks result in a tubular rating becomes compromised after a particular scale treatment. Where a scale treatment compromises a well component instead of improving well performance, for example, a workover may be performed on the corresponding well component instead. Thus, some embodiments are integrated in various well intervention operations to manage control systems, well delivery schedules, and other well operations.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0042">In Block <b>230</b>, a scale treatment is determined for a well in accordance with one or more embodiments. The scale treatment may be similar to one of the scale treatments described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the accompanying description. In particular, multiple scale treatments with different parameters may be available to remove a particular type of scale. Thus, predicted caliper log values from different descaling models may be used to determine which scale treatment to use. In some embodiments, parameters of a scale treatment are tailored to a particular well based on the results of the predicted caliper log values.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0043">In Block <b>240</b>, one or more commands are transmitted to perform a scale treatment in a well in accordance with one or more embodiments. For example, one or more control systems may be used to implemented one or more scale treatments. Thus, a control system may transmit one or more commands to one or more well components to implement the scale treatment determined in Block <b>230</b>. Such commands may be used to manage a well delivery schedule regarding one or more wells. Likewise, commands may also be transmitted over a well network, e.g., as part of an automation algorithm for one or more well intervention operations.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0044">In Block <b>250</b>, one or more tubular replacements are determined for a well in accordance with one or more embodiments. Where the resulting descaled well fails to be suitable for future well operations, a corresponding tubular replacement operation may be implemented. Accordingly, a replacement operation may use the existing well design parameters, or adjust them accordingly based on changes to the well.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0045">In Block <b>260</b>, one or more commands are transmitted based on one or more tubular replacements in accordance with one or more embodiments.
