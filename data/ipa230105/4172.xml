APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0086665 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 1, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a mobile object and a method of operating the same, and more particularly, to a mobile object capable of delivering an article, and a method of operating the mobile object.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is an increasing demand for mobility vehicles that can be used for various purposes in addition to the existing vehicles, and thus studies are being actively conducted on unmanned delivery robots.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The unmanned delivery robot encounters various types of obstacles during a process of delivering an article. In particular, when the unmanned delivery robot encounters an obstacle protruding upward from a route, the unmanned delivery robot needs to climb over the obstacle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the unmanned delivery robot in the related art does not include a separate mechanism for overcoming the obstacle. Even in a case in which the unmanned delivery robot in the related art has the mechanism for overcoming the obstacle, there is a problem in that safety of an article being delivered cannot be ensured because the horizontal stability of the unmanned delivery robot deteriorates during a process of overcoming the obstacle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007"

step, the accommodation part may rotate relative to the body part so that a center of gravity of the mobile object is positioned forward from a region in which the wheel is in contact with the obstacle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the first-3 step, the accommodation part may rotate relative to the body part so that the accommodation part is perpendicular to a gravitational direction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A third exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method of controlling the mobile object, the method including a second-1 step in which the drive part is positioned at a front side of the mobile object and faces an obstacle protruding from a ground surface, a second-2 step in which the body part rotates relative to the drive part and the

In further detail of the drive part <b>200</b>, particularly, the wheel <b>210</b> may be coupled to a lower region of the body part <b>100</b>. For example, as illustrated in the drawings, the drive part <b>200</b> may include two wheels <b>210</b>. However, the number of wheels provided in the drive part <b>200</b> is not limited by the contents illustrated in the drawings, and more wheels may be present in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, the mobile object <b>10</b> may include an accommodation part <b>300</b> coupled to the other side of the body part <b>100</b> and having an internal space S capable of accommodating an article.

The body part <b>100</b> may be rotatable relative to the drive part <b>200</b>. The accommodation part <b>300</b> may be coupled to the upper region of the body part <b>100</b>. The accommodation part <b>300</b> may be rotatable relative to the body part <b>100</b>. More particularly, the body part <b>100</b> may be coupled to be rotatable in a forward or rearward direction relative to the drive part <b>200</b>, and the accommodation part <b>300</b> may be coupled to be rotatable in the forward/rearward direction relative to the body part <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the present disclosure, i) the rotational motion of the body part <b>100</b> relative to the drive part <b>200</b> and ii) the rotational motion of the accommodation part <b>300</b> relative to the body part <b>100</b> are independently performed. Therefore, when the mobile object <b>10</b> encounters an obstacle, a center of gravity of the mobile object <b>10</b> may be quickly moved, such that the mobile object <b>10</b> may easily pass over the obstacle. A process in which the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure passes over the obstacle will be described below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may include a frame <b>310</b> including a plurality of rod members <b>300</b><i>a </i>coupled to one another to define an internal space S, and a battery <b>320</b> fixed to a lower region of the frame <b>310</b>.

Therefore, the center of gravity of the mobile object <b>10</b> may be moved in the forward/rearward direction by the rotational motion of the accommodation part <b>300</b>. In this case, when the battery <b>320</b> is disposed on the lower region of the frame <b>310</b>, the battery <b>320</b> is positioned below the center of gravity of the accommodation part <b>300</b>.

Therefore, according to the present disclosure, the first rotary shaft <b>332</b> may be rotated relative to the first plate <b>114</b> by the operation of the rotary motor <b>330</b>. Therefore, the rotational motion of the accommodation part <b>300</b> relative to the body part <b>100</b> may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Meanwhile, when the accommodation part <b>300</b> is rotated relative to the body part <b>100</b> by the operation of the rotary motor <b>330</b>, a second rotary shaft <b>340</b> needs to be rotated along with the rotation of the first rotary shaft <b>332</b>. To this end, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may further include the second rotary shaft <b>340</b> configured to penetrate the second plate <b>124</b> and provided to be rotatable relative to the second plate <b>124</b>. Unlike the first rotary shaft <b>332</b>, the second rotary shaft <b>340</b> may not be rotated by a separate power but instead is rotated passively by the rotation of the first rotary shaft <b>332</b>. Meanwhile, bearing members may be additionally provided between the first rotary shaft <b>332</b> and the first plate <b>114</b> and between the second rotary shaft <b>340</b> and the second plate <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Method of Controlling Mobile Object</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are views illustrating an example in which the mobile object according to the present disclosure climbs over an obstacle on a ground surface.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a first example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure allows the mobile object <b>10</b> to pass an obstacle A when the mobile object <b>10</b> encounters the obstacle A on a ground surface L while the mobile object <b>10</b> moves.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In further detail, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, the first example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure may include a first-1 step in which the drive part <b>200</b>, i.e., the wheel <b>210</b> is positioned at a front side of the mobile object <b>10</b> and faces the obstacle A protruding from the ground surface L, a first-2 step in which the body part <b>100</b> rotates forward relative to the drive part <b>200</b> and the body part <b>100</b> tilts forward, a first-3 step in which the rotary motor <b>330</b> operates and rotates the first rotary shaft <b>332</b> and the accommodation part <b>300</b> rotates relative to the body part <b>100</b> in a direction in which the accommodation part <b>300</b> moves forward, and a first-4 step in which the wheel <b>210</b> of the drive part <b>200</b> rotates and the mobile object <b>10</b> moves forward and passes the obstacle A.

In the first-3 step, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b> so that a center of gravity G of the mobile object <b>10</b> is positioned forward from a region in which the wheel <b>210</b> is in contact with the obstacle A. More particularly, before the first-3 step, the center of gravity G of the mobile object <b>10</b> may be positioned rearward from the region in which the wheel <b>210</b> is in contact with the obstacle A. After the first-3 step, the center of gravity G of the mobile object <b>10</b> may be positioned forward from the region in which the wheel <b>210</b> is in contact with the obstacle A.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The description will be made with reference to the above-mentioned contents. In the first-2 step, the body part <b>100</b> tilts forward to allow the mobile object <b>10</b> to easily pass the obstacle A by moving a center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the accommodation part <b>300</b> forward in a state in which a center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the drive part <b>200</b> is fixed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Meanwhile, to allow the mobile object <b>10</b> to easily pass the obstacle A, the center of gravity G of the mobile object needs to be positioned forward from the region in which the mobile object <b>10</b> is in contact with the obstacle A. In this case, if the accommodation part <b>300</b> does not rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b>, the body part <b>100</b> needs to tilt forward greatly to move the center of gravity of the mobile object <b>10</b> forward.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, according to the present disclosure, since the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b>, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate forward in the first-3 step. Therefore, in the first-2 step, the center of gravity G of the mobile object <b>10</b> may be effectively moved forward even though the body part <b>100</b> tilts forward to a relatively low degree. The forward rotational motion of the accommodation part <b>300</b> relative to the body part <b>100</b> may be understood as being similar to the motion of the inverted pendulum.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In particular, according to the present disclosure described above, since the battery <b>320</b> provided in the accommodation part <b>300</b> is fixed to the bottom surface of the frame <b>310</b>, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the accommodation part <b>300</b> may be disposed at a relatively lower side. Therefore, a distance between the first rotary shaft <b>332</b> and the center of gravity G of the accommodation part <b>300</b> may be maximized, and thus the movement amount of the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the accommodation part <b>300</b> in accordance with the rotation of the first rotary shaft <b>332</b> may also be maximized.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Meanwhile, in the first-3 step of the first example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b> so that the accommodation part <b>300</b> is perpendicular to the gravitational direction. In this case, it is possible to prevent a problem that the article stored in the internal space of the accommodation part <b>300</b> is lopsided to one side during the process in which the mobile object <b>10</b> passes the obstacle A.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Meanwhile, a second example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure may include a second-1 step in which the drive part <b>200</b> is positioned at the front side of the mobile object <b>10</b> and faces the obstacle A protruding from the ground surface L, a second-2 step in which the body part <b>100</b> rotate relative to the drive part <b>200</b> and the body part <b>100</b> tilts forward, a second-3 step in which the wheel <b>210</b> of the drive part <b>200</b> rotates and the mobile object <b>10</b> moves forward, and a second-4 step in which the accommodation part <b>300</b> rotates relative to the body part <b>100</b> in a direction in which the accommodation part <b>300</b> moves rearward which is opposite to the forward direction. For example, the second-2 step, the second-3 step, and the second-4 step may at least partially overlap one another in a time series manner. Alternatively, the second-2 step, the second-3 step, and the second-4 step may be simultaneously performed.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure minimizes a magnitude of net force applied to the article accommodated in the internal space of the accommodation part <b>300</b> when the mobile object <b>10</b> passes the obstacle A, thereby minimizing acceleration of the article. That is, in the second-2 step and the second-3 step, a force is applied to the accommodation part <b>300</b> forward. In contrast, in the second-4 step, a force is applied to the accommodation part <b>300</b>. Therefore, a magnitude of net force applied to the accommodation part <b>300</b> and the article may decrease.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Meanwhile, the second example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure may further include a second-5 step in which the accommodation part <b>300</b> rotates relative to the body part <b>100</b> in the direction in which the accommodation part <b>300</b> moves forward after the second-4 step. The second-5 step is performed to compensate for the rearward tilting of the accommodation part <b>300</b> in the second-4 step.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, in the second example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure, like the first-3 step of the first example, the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b> so that the accommodation part <b>300</b> is perpendicular to the gravitational direction in the second-5 step.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Meanwhile, a third example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure is provided to accelerate the mobile object <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In further detail, the third example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure may include an acceleration step of accelerating the mobile object <b>10</b>. In this case, in the acceleration step, i) a rotational speed of the wheel <b>210</b> of the drive part <b>200</b> may increase, and ii) the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b> in a direction in which the mobile object <b>10</b> moves.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the third example, since the accommodation part <b>300</b> rotates in the forward direction in which the mobile object <b>10</b> moves, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the accommodation part <b>300</b> moves forward. Therefore, the mobile object <b>10</b> may be more quickly accelerated, and a distance required to accelerate the mobile object <b>10</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, a fourth example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure is provided to decelerate the mobile object <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In further detail, the fourth example of the method of controlling the mobile object <b>10</b> according to the present disclosure may include a deceleration step of decelerating the mobile object <b>10</b>. In this case, in the deceleration step, i) a rotational speed of the wheel <b>210</b> of the drive part <b>200</b> may decrease, and ii) the accommodation part <b>300</b> may rotate relative to the body part <b>100</b> in a direction opposite to the direction in which the mobile object <b>10</b> moves.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the fourth example, since the accommodation part <b>300</b> rotates in the rearward direction opposite to the forward direction in which the mobile object <b>10</b> moves, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the accommodation part <b>300</b> moves rearward. Therefore, the mobile object <b>10</b> may be more quickly decelerated, and a distance required to decelerate the mobile object <b>10</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present disclosure has been described with reference to the limited embodiments and the drawings, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto.
