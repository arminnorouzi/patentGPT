No. 15/931,892 filed on May 14, 2020, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETECTING FRAUD RINGS and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to fraud detection technology, and more specifically technology detecting fraud attempts by groups of individuals, such as against a contact center or other entity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer systems exist to detect fraud perpetrated against call centers or other organizations via interactions such as voice or telephone interactions. An interaction may be a conversation or exchange of information between two or more people, for example a customer, person or fraudster on the one hand, and a call center agent or another person on the other hand. An interaction may be for example a telephone call, chat exchange, e-mail exchange, or combination of such exchanges. An interaction may describe both the event of the conversation and also the data associated with that conversation, such as an audio recording of the conversation, text messages exchanged as part of the interaction, and metadata. Metadata describing an interaction may include information beyond the exchange itself: metadata may include for example the telephone number of the customer or fraudster (e.g. gathered via AM, automatic number identification), an internet protocol (IP) address associated with equipment used by the caller or fraudster, account information relevant to or discussed in the interaction, the purported name or identification (ID) of the person, audio information related to the interaction such as background noise, and other information.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Technology exists to detect fraudsters by clustering calls or interactions based on the fraudster's voice. Such technology may not be able to detect a coordinated, linked defraud effort of multiple different fraudsters, which may be termed a fraud ring.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A group of individuals in a fraud ring may cooperate to produce damage to an organization or individual. For example, more than one separate person (each person having a different voice) may call the same institution in order to obtain a fraudulent loan, using the same general techniques. Each person may call the institution using a different phone number and different name, making it hard to correlate the different people as being part of one ring. In another example, a number of different people may contact a certain institution regarding the same individual account, each attempting to get an item of information regarding the account with the goal of taking over or taking control of the account, e.g. to fraudulently transfer funds.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A system and method may identify a fraud ring based on call or interaction data by analyzing, by a computer processor, interaction data including audio recordings to identify clusters of interactions which are suspected of involving fraud, each cluster including interactions having the same speaker (typically the same speaker external to the organization, not necessarily the same speaker being an agent within the organization); analyzing by the computer processor the clusters, in combination with metadata associated with the interaction data, to identify fraud rings, each fraud ring describing a plurality of different speakers, each fraud ring defined by a set of speakers and a set of metadata corresponding to interactions including that speaker; and for each fraud ring, creating a relevance value or score defining the relative relevance of the fraud ring.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the invention may improve security or fraud detection technology, by for example analyzing call metadata together with voice clusters to expose sophisticated fraud rings. Machine learning (ML) algorithms may be used, and may receive calls and metadata, and may provide an indication as to whether a suspicious fraud ring is detected or not, automatically.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Currently, it is difficult or impossible to determine complex connections between interactions that would indicate suspected fraud rings. Doing so manually is difficult and impractical, and a human would not use the various algorithms discussed herein. Embodiments may expose cross-cluster connections that are not detected by standalone clustering algorithm.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Non-limiting examples of embodiments of the disclosure are described below with reference to figures listed below.

Each individual in a ring might not themselves trigger an alarm, but forming rings into clusters may improve the ability of fraud technology to detect fraud.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments may improve fraud detection technology by combining &#x201c;Something you are&#x201d; (e.g. biometric information such as a voiceprint) with &#x201c;Something you have&#x201d; (e.g. a smart personal identification card, RSA SecureID token device, a telephone device or a subscriber identification module (SIM) card) and &#x201c;Something you know&#x201d; (e.g. a password or one's primary school's name).

The operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be performed by the systems described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, but other systems may be used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In operation <b>50</b>, an interaction may take place; for example a person (e.g. external to the organization) may engage in a telephone call with an agent at a call center (the agent typically internal to the organization, e.g. the call center) regarding a certain account. The interaction itself (an audio recording of the call) may be recorded, and data describing the interaction, such as metadata, may be recorded. In some embodiments, if the interaction involves a user using a computing device including for example a mobile application or a web page, additional metadata may be captured such as the behavior of the user relative to the device or software, e.g. the way the user moves the mouse, the buttons interacted with, timing of operations etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Only certain interactions, for example those corresponding to certain rules, may be input to cluster detection and/or ring-detection processes; in other embodiments all interactions may be input to a cluster and/or ring-detection process, Interactions or calls may first be collected and filtered or flagged to produce calls or interactions which are deemed to be high risk, significant, or otherwise relevant to a PFE process to determine or create clusters of interactions by the same speaker possibly involved in fraud or high risk transactions. A PFE cluster may be a group of events and data where a person with the same voice (thus the same person) engages in multiple interactions or telephone calls with one entity such as a call center (where the person associated with the call center, e.g. the agent is not considered to be the person with the same voice). A PFE cluster may be detected by detecting the same voice (typically the same calling voice, or the same voice external to the call center) used across multiple interactions, e.g. using voiceprint matching or comparison. A PFE cluster may refer to both the real-world events (e.g. multiple interactions) and the data structure(s) representing such a cluster. A cluster may include or be identified by data such as a cluster ID (identification), the telephone numbers involved, a voiceprint, a cluster score (e.g. measuring the probability the identified cluster is in fact a cluster), etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments interactions or audio recordings may be analyzed to identify clusters or groups of such recording or interactions which are suspected of fraud or being associated with fraud, where each cluster includes or is associated with interactions or audio recordings, each interaction or audio recording associated with the same speaker (the speaker being other than an agent at a call center).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, in operation <b>52</b>, in an identification or &#x201c;tagging&#x201d; phase, it may be determined if the interaction should be sent to a cluster identification process. A set of rules may have been defined (e.g. by a security officer) that describe which interactions should be sent for cluster or ring analysis. Example rules include for example, that if any of the following occur, the interaction should go to cluster:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0028">a.

When an interaction or call ends, its information (e.g. voice data, metadata) may be sent to a calls or interaction collection engine which applies rules or other functionality to determine if the interaction matches to one or more pre-defined rules of the system. If the interaction matches one or more of the rules, it is stored in a pending interaction database <b>22</b> pending interaction database, waiting to be analyzed by a PFE engine <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032">In operation <b>54</b> a computer processor such as processor executing or acting as a I&#x2032;FE engine <b>30</b> may analyze calls or interactions filtered or flagged and deemed to be highly relevant (e.g. stored in pending interaction database <b>22</b>) to identify clusters of interactions, for example those which are suspected of involving fraud each cluster including the same speaker. Each cluster may be represented as, stored as, or defined by a graph of relevant data, with data such as metadata (e the purported identity of a caller, the voiceprint-defined identity of the caller, etc.) linked to other data in the cluster by relationships, arcs, links or edges. Other methods of defining, storing or representing a cluster may be used.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033">Clustering may be performed periodically, for example once a day, or based on other periods, or other triggers to start.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Clusters of interactions may be created by matching the voices in the various interactions to other voices in the interactions. In one embodiment, for each relevant interaction a voiceprint (VP) may be created, stored for example in database <b>20</b>, pending interaction database <b>22</b>, and/or cluster database <b>32</b>, the voiceprint representing features of the person's voice. A VP may be a spectrogram, or acoustic frequency spectrum of a voice, or a vector or feature vector of, for example, 400 numbers, typically stored in digital form. A VP may be a vector of voice biometric attributes. A cluster may be represented as a matrix or a list of VP vectors, together with a calculated score or rank; a cluster may be for example a collection of voice prints and a calculated score. For example, for each cluster, the confidence and/or amount of the inner ties among VPs may be calculated, and this value or score may be normalized. This score may be used to sort the clusters and decide which are relevant (e.g. to a ring detection process) and which are not. One embodiment may use probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) scores to compare VPs. Other embodiments may use a neural networks (NN) such as a DNN (e.g. using x-vectors). A cluster may also be represented as a graph. VI's may be compared using similarity scores, resulting from a comparison of two voice samples based on extracted i-vectors.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">Clustering voices into clusters may be performed by generating a similarity score for each pair of voices or VPs, each voice or voiceprint corresponding to an interaction, and then performing an algorithm such as the following:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">Given N interactions, and a threshold (T)&#x2014;N empty groups (G).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">Create a N&#xd7;N matrix (M) containing compare scores of all pairwise comparisons of pairs of VPs.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">Diagonal values nay be set to (-infinity).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">For i from 0 to N:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0040">a.

The data or metadata pattern in the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows three interactions with similarities. All three are part of the same PPE cluster, indicating the same speaker; in all three, the claim of the speaker was that the speaker was Customer1, and the telephone number or ANI of the two interactions on the left match the listed phone number of the claimed customer (Customer1) while the telephone number or ANI of the interaction on the right does not match the listed phone number of the claimed customer but rather matches a listed phone number of a different customer (Customer2), who is not the claimed customer of that interaction.

For example, a technician may understand from a specific user or customer what types of metadata and metadata connections are important or which define rings. For example, rules may cause clusters to be combined to rings if two people who are different per their voiceprint or providing different self-identification, provide or use the same phone or account number, which indicates clusters including those two people are in the same ring. A set of rules may be developed based on this information for use by a ring identification process, which may identify rings and provide the rings to a technician. The technician may provide feedback in response to the identified rings. For example, a technician may indicate that identified fraud rings are or are not fraud rings, or the technician may indicate that certain links within an identified ring (e.g. as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) are more or less important. Such feedback may include scores or ratings of rings or links. After receiving this feedback, a ring identification process may learn and create ratings or weights for the rules, diminishing or increasing the power or use of certain rules during the identification process.

Metadata may be represented in manners other than a graph. A ring may be defined in part by the speakers associated with the ring. Some of such metadata may identify ties or connections between clusters. Metadata may include interaction transcripts or information derived from such transcripts: for example certain text repeating across calls may indicate a correlation among the calls, and thus a ring.

Thus a relevance function or value may be used. The relevance or rank of rings may include exterior knowledge about the clusters (e.g. metadata) that are contained in an identified ring.

A user may indicate or double click on a displayed fraud ring to &#x201c;drill down&#x201d; and display an expanded view including for example, as a list of individual fraudsters in the cluster, the number of speaker IDs (the ID of the claimed customer, or an ID generated for a suspected fraudster, used to track that suspected fraudster) for each fraudster, the type of detected fraud behavior, the number of calls attributed to that fraudster (e.g. as part of the ring, or calls detected outside the ring), the frequency of a fraudster's activity, a status (e.g. the caller or speaker was added to a watch list), the rank or relevance (e.g. a PFE rank categorizing fraudsters by low, medium and high, typically relative to other suspected fraudsters), a type of fraud attempted by an individual, and comments if any. A ring may have a rank or relevance (e.g. low, medium, high) separate from the rank of fraudsters in the ring. A cluster or fraudsters may be ranked for example based on how likely the cluster is indeed a cluster of the same person.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0088">A security officer reviewing the presented fraud rings may for example, approve the ring (e.g. confirm it is actually a relevant fraud ring, such confirmation possibly being fed back to the relevance module), reject the ring (e.g. correct that it is not a relevant fraud ring, such information possibly being fed back to the relevance module for training), or send FRE engine <b>40</b> other input according to the taken decision, to allow it to learn about its recommendations' quality. FRE engine <b>40</b> may use the security officer's input to re-train its model. FRE engine <b>40</b> may use a security officer's input to detect consistent fraud ring detection results, which may contribute to the automation of the process. Known outcomes of historical interactions (e.g. post-facto knowledge of a perpetrated fraud) can be used by a security officer to refine and redefine the rules and weights in the engine. The approved rings' individuals may be added, e.g. automatically or by a security officer, to a real-time watchlist of fraudsters (e.g. such that if any member of the ring contacts the contact center, an alert is presented or triggered in real time). Such a watchlist may be used automatically as part of fraudster detection on future calls. Creating a relevance value or score defining the relative relevance of a newly seen fraud ring may use information regarding previously seen fraud rings: for example an embodiment may have received from a person such as a security officer a relevance value for a previous or previously seen fraud ring, and may use the received relevance value to create a relevance value defining the relative relevance of the newly seen fraud ring. This may be done by comparing the new and previously seen rings: for example creating a relevance value for a newly seen ring may include first comparing the new fraud ring to a fraud ring having a previously determined relevance value, and then using this comparison, and the relevance value of the previously seen ring, to determine a relevance value for the new ring.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0089">A user display may display the type of fraud attempted, including for example:<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0090">1.

A relevance value or function may define the relevance of the ring relative to other rings. A value of a relevance value or function may be for example a range of 0-1, 0-100, or another scale. A relevance value or function may aim to estimate the significance of inputs such as data describing the ring itself, e.g. data represented by a graph representing the ring, and/or data such the identities of the speakers in a ring, metadata such as ANIs in a ring, IPs of the speakers, geolocations of the speaker, claimed speaker IDs, credit card numbers, account IDs, etc. and connections between such items in the graph (e.g. the edges).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0095">A given ring may be defined by for example a vector X(A, Y) where A may be clusters relevant to or defining the ring (e.g. output from a PFE process) and Y may be metadata, presented as for example key-value combinations (the key being the descriptor or category and the value being the value corresponding to the key) which, in in combination with a system's knowledge about previously seen rings' data and these rings importance, determines a new rings' relevance or importance. Importance or relevance may be exterior information input by a security analyst, such that over time a system or the engine learns to identify importance or relevance in an implicit way through machine learning. After appropriate machine learning or training the importance or relevance remains implicit but a system is able to determine importance or relevance using a trained engine</p><p id="p-0065" num="0096">Various methods may be used to construct or create the relevance value or function.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0097">In a rule-based method, expert knowledge may be used to create a relevance value or function. This relies on the security personnel's knowledge of whether a ring is relevant or not, and thus it may be difficult to estimate it continuously. For example, it may be questionable as to whether an expert that asserts a ring is relevant can be relied on with much accuracy. Thus in some embodiments a security officer may be asked to provide a binary relevant/not relevant input, rather than a numerical rating. A security officer may alter weights or relevance of data in a ring; e.g. arcs or links.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0098">Various machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence systems or algorithms may be used to create a relevance value or function.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0099">Expert data, such as historical data or human labelling, may be used to train deep learning, deep-Q, reinforcement learning, or other machine learning tools. For example, in a supervised learning system, human experts may label each ring in a binary manner (relevant=1, not relevant=0). This &#x201c;wisdom of the crowd&#x201d; (e.g. the experts) analysis may be input to an ML tool or system such as random forest or a neural network which may be trained, and which may then create relevance scores for new or unseen rings. Expert or historical data input to train ML algorithms may be in the form of a trained model F&#x2014;(Deterministic or semi-stochastic), where F maps each ring X to an interval I (e.g. [0,1] or [0,100]), where I is the relevance score scale. In an inference operation to determine if a ring is deemed relevant, an inference module (e.g. an ML module) may receive a pre-defined relevance threshold T (for example a number in range I) and the pair (X, F), X being a ring and F being a model, and may output y&#x3f5;I. In other embodiments, thresholds need not be used. In some embodiments, an ML embodiment may output a score or rating which, if above a threshold, deems the ring relevant, and if not above the threshold, deems the ring not relevant. The output may be a distilled relevance measure that attaches a relevance value or score to every given fraud ring.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0100">Another ML system that may be used includes a random forest method, which may be a supervised learning method. A random forest ML system is an ensemble learning method for operating by constructing a number of decision trees at training time. A set of decision trees may be constructed. For each tree rings may be injected or input with their associated labels (e g human generated relevance scores, for example on a scale or binary). At each step or decision within a tree a security office may pick or determine which attribute in the ring to cause a decision or split based upon an importance generic measurement (e.g. information gain, purity gain) associated with the importance of an attribute of the ring to its relevance. This may be done for a set of known rings. The output may be a set of trees, that for a given new, unseen, fraud ring returns a set of distributions that is combined into a single core. After such training using pre-categorized or pre-rated rings (input with their relevance value), a new ring when input to the random forest receives from the random forest a relevance value.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0101">One ML system to create a relevance value includes a NN such as a deep NN, which may be a supervised learning method. A NN may refer to an information processing paradigm that may include nodes, referred to as neurons, organized into layers, with links between the neurons. The links may transfer signals between neurons and may be associated with weights. A NN may be configured or trained for a specific task, e.g., pattern recognition or classification. Training a NN for the specific task may involve adjusting these weights based on examples. Each neuron of an intermediate or last layer may receive an input signal, e.g., a weighted sum of output signals from other neurons, and may process the input signal using a linear or nonlinear function (e.g., an activation function). The results of the input and intermediate layers may be transferred to other neurons and the results of the output layer may be provided as the output of the NN. Typically, the neurons and links within a NN are represented by mathematical constructs, such as activation functions and matrices of data elements and weights. A processor, e.g. CPUs or graphics processing units (GPUs), or a dedicated hardware device may perform the relevant calculations.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0102">During training of a NN fraud rings and labels (e.g. human generated relevance scores, for example on a scale or binary) may be input to the NN. For example, labels may be in a binary mask, where the rings are in continuous or binary representation. At each step or iteration a ring may be provided to a NN as an input and if the network calculated the relevance label or score correctly nothing is done, otherwise the NN weights may be adjusted using NN back propagation. The output may be a NN with fixed weights that is able to predict every ring (e.g. in a similar mechanism to a random forest).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0103">One embodiment using a NN such as a DNN may estimate the odds that a ring is indeed &#x201c;interesting&#x201d; or relevant. In one example, rings are considered relevant for analysis if the amount of ANIs that exist in the ring (some may find a unique ANI as relevant, other many) is above or below a certain amount, credit types or categories lower than 3 and a high PFE classes or ratings (in one embodiment, the higher the number of calls in a PFE, the higher its class). Data input to the NN may be labelled based on rules such as this and provide the NN data for training. Training may be performed by inputting a number of sample rings to a NN, having a security specialist rate or determine the output to provide a correction, and have the NN calculate loss and perform back propagation for NN training. The example NN may return that:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0104">P(Ring A is relevant)=0.99</p><p id="p-0074" num="0105">P(Ring B is relevant)=0.2</p><p id="p-0075" num="0106">P(Ring C is relevant)=0.99</p><p id="p-0076" num="0107">One ML system to create a relevance value includes Bayesian methods as are known in the art (e.g. statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more information becomes available). In an embodiment using Bayesian methods, there may be an assumption about the distribution of the relevance scores in fraud rings; using this the parameters of the distribution e.g. mean and variance for a Gaussian distribution, may be trained (e.g. if it is believed that the relevance has a Gaussian distribution, the mean and standard deviation may be learned), A Bayesian training method may be performed to learn generic distribution through generic parameters (e.g. mean and variance), to learn a certain Gaussian distribution of relevance scores of rings, After such training the distribution may be used to take as input a newly seen ring, and to output the likelihood of the relevance of that ring falling at a certain spot on the distribution. For example, rings represented as numbers such as hot codings or embeddings may be distributed with assigned relevance scores across a Gaussian distribution, and a new ring may be placed in the Gaussian such that its relevance, as a probability measure, may be determined.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0108">ML systems used to create relevance values may include unsupervised learning methods. Unsupervised methods differ from supervised in the sense that there are no labels or scores provided by humans (at least to start: feedback may be provided after an initial analysis). This may prevent the learning of a deterministic function from the rings to the relevance space (e.g. the interval [0,1]). A suitable unsupervised ML learning algorithm may learn from the data existing, which is the rings themselves. An algorithm may learn appropriate representations within the data. Having such representations with a coherent metric function on the space of representation may aid in learning as it may be assumed that the relevance function continues in some level. Unsupervised (or supervised) methods may compare data representations of rings to find rings which are similar to each other, e.g. in a graph or based on another representation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0109">That continuity may hold may be seen from the opposite scenario, where one assumes that the relevance function has manners of Dirichlet function, shown below in equation 1:</p><p id="p-0079" num="0000">Let c and d&#x2260;c be real numbers (usually taken as c=1 and d=0).

This is perhaps possible, but removes every plausible mechanism. Thus continuity is essential. Embodiments of the invention may use embedding techniques such that rings are mapped into vectors (e.g. ordered lists of numbers corresponding to characteristics of the rings) and vectors that are near each other by some measure are assumed to have near or close relevance. Thus knowing the relevance for a previously seen ring and the distance between the vector for that ring and a new ring, one may determine the relevance for the new ring.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0111">One ML embedding technique that may be used to create a relevance value defining the relative relevance of a fraud ring is PCA. A PCA embodiment may input all fraud ring vectors (e.g. a vector X(A, Y) where A may be clusters relevant to or defining the ring and Y may be metadata) and measure their covariance matrix. From that an embodiment may calculate the eigen states and project the vectors on the leading states (e.g. leading upon the eigen values magnitude). The output may be a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables which may allow a user or process to determine the most relevant or important attributes of rings. Such an example projection is shown in the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts representations of fraud rings graphed according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, each of the X axis and Y axis represents the two characteristics (e.g. tenure and annual income) of the plotted rings (represented by circles on the graph), which are zeroed, per the X and Y axes. Data corresponding to fraud rings (represented as circles) may be plotted in its raw representation after being centerized (e.g. the mean is subtracted from each coordinate's data). The PCA representation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may provide a new set of coordinates (PCA first and second dimensions), using rotated axes where the angle is determined by the singularities of the data variance. The PCA first and second dimensions may represent the highest variance direction and the best perpendicular to this direction. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> the PCA 1<sup>st </sup>dimension <b>600</b> represents a leading component (e.g. most important data variance-wise) and PCA 2d dimension <b>602</b> represents a second leading component. Fraud rings <b>604</b> are plotted according to these components. An analysis such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may be used to determine input to an ML or other tool.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0112">Another ML technique used in some embodiments is ring embedding. Embedding is used in text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) and may resolve the need for quantitative representation of words. In the context of ring analysis, embedding may classify rings as being similar or not to each other, which in combination with a user's input regarding the relevance of certain rings, may allow for an automatic determination of the relevance of newly seen rings whose relevance has not been rated by a user. An unsupervised version of embedding may be performed by an autoencoder. An engine such as a NN may receive an input vector (e.g. an ordered series of numbers such as a hot coding) describing a fraud ring. The engine may map the ring to a lower dimension space (e.g. a vector representing the ring and which may be used to determine the ring's similarity to other rings) and then restore it to the original vector space for the purpose of learning to accurately encode rings. Learning such as NN backpropagation may be performed based on the restored vector: the error may be calculated between the input and the output, typically performed in L2 norm (e.g. the square root of the element wise square differences). A weight update of the NN may follow backpropagation based on the error. The resulting embedding representations may be mapped to a Euclidean space to determine the distance and thus possibly the similarity between rings.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0113">Characteristics describing the ring or the entities constituting the ring (e.g. clusters or individuals) may be represented as hot coded vectors. &#x201c;One hot&#x201d; encoding translates categorical variables or numbers into a form provided to ML algorithms. A one-hot coding is a group of bits where the legal combinations (typically for a data item) include only those with a single high (1) bit and all the others low (0). For example, if a certain characteristic of a cluster entity has a value of 0-5 (e.g. tenure or length of time of a person as being known by an institution) that may be represented as 0=000001, 1=000010, 2=000100, etc.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0114">In one example, a ring is defined by entities or clusters each cluster representing a person. Each entity in one example is described by tenure (length of time known by the system), gender, ANI, PFE class, score or results (e.g. a PFE score may represent the average of similarity scores within clusters; a PFE class may be higher the number of separate calls within a PFE) and credit degree or assessment (represented using two genders, 5 types of or different ANIs (an ANI is typically a telephone number; here it is depicted as a low integer for simplicity), 10 PFE classes, 6 credit degrees and 7 ranges or lengths of tenures. Three example people may have the following characteristics where the integers correspond to a characteristic, e.g. male=1, female=0:</p><p id="p-0086" num="0115">Person A has tenure 1, gender 1, PFE 3, ANI 2 and credit 1</p><p id="p-0087" num="0116">Person B has tenure 2, gender 0, PFE 5, ANI 0 and credit 4</p><p id="p-0088" num="0117">Person C has tenure 2, gender 0, PFE 3, ANI 2 and credit 1</p><p id="p-0089" num="0118">One embodiment uses one hot coding method for each attribute, in order to represent for input to an ML algorithm a ring's constituent people (e.g. clusters). Thus the three rings are represented as (in the following simplified example each ring includes one person; typically a ring includes more than one person):<ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0119">Ring A [0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.1,0.0.0,1.0.0,0.0.0,0.0.0,1.0.0,0.1.0,0.0.0.]</li>        <li id="ul0017-0002" num="0120">Ring B: [0.0.1.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.]</li>        <li id="ul0017-0003" num="0121">Ring C: [0.0.1.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.]</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0090" num="0122">Such hot coded vectors are input to an autoencoder. After that, geometry may be measured: the vectors output from the auto encoder may have distances measured between each pair (e.g. measuring the Euclidian distances between entities). For example, the distances between the rings (represented as an example as groups of people) discussed above may be:<ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0019" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0123">D(A,B)=3.7765644</li>        <li id="ul0019-0002" num="0124">D(A,C)=1.788</li>        <li id="ul0019-0003" num="0125">D(B,C)=3.203643</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0091" num="0126">In this example rings A and C are closest. In one embodiment, a user provides input regarding the relevance of a certain ring, and based on that relevance and the distance to a ring X, which is new and unseen or not rated by a user, the relevance of ring X may be determined, for example using a trained NN In this manner, similar clusters may have similar relevance scores.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0127">An output of an ML or other process may be clusters and the suspected fraud rings, rated for relevance, or presented as relevant or not relevant, which may be presented in a display or web application that a security officer can review.

If the security officer suspects that a call is made by an actual fraudster, he can add the call and the fraudsters information to a fraudsters' watch list. If the officer deems the call to be not of a fraudster, or the ring not relevant, an appropriate process may receive feedback from the officer and possible adjust its model. Later, if the same fraudster calls the contact center, it may be detected by a real-time fraudster prevention solution.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0128">Various data structures may store the data described herein. Voice data buffers may be held using byte-arrays storing binary data. Scores may be numeric values, held in a data structure such as a dictionary, mapping a pair of compared measures to their comparison score result. Alternatively, scores can be stored as a List as JSON structures or similar. A PFE engine may use i-vectors to represent the voiceprints. i-vectors may be stored as byte-arrays. An &#x201c;i-vector&#x201d; may be an intermediate vectors or identity vector which is an enhancement for a previously used approach in speaker verification technology called Joint Factor Analysis (JFA). JFA divides a human voice into two factors: a speaker factor and a channel factor. The data structure of the i-vectors may be an array, and each element in the data structure may represent a characteristic of the speech of a speaker.

Customer metadata may be stored as a complex object including for example: Customer ID, tenant ID (e.g. the identity of the organization owning or creating the data or associated with the customers, in the case of a system handling multiple such organizations), CRM reference, gender ID, first name, last name, address, birth date, seniority, nationality, state of origin, credit risk, marital status or other data.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0130">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, showing a high-level block diagram of an exemplary computing device according to some embodiments of the present invention.
