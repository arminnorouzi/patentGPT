The present invention also relates to an apparatus for testing a device having a fine pitch and a device alignment method. More particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus for aligning a device having a fine pitch, an apparatus for testing a device having a fine pitch, and a device alignment method, in which after loading all devices to be tested on a base plate, the loaded devices are aligned at the same time so that the test thereof can be performed by bringing the ball terminals of the devices into contact with the terminals of a tester at the same time.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, semiconductor devices such as ICs are inspected for defects by inspecting electrical characteristics during the manufacturing process thereof. The electrical characteristic test of a semiconductor device is performed by electrically connecting the ball terminals of a semiconductor device and the contact points of a test board including a printed circuit board PCB. Such a test is conducted for a set time so that good products are shipped and defective products are retested or discarded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, devices to be tested are individually transferred to a tester side so as to carry out the test of the electrical characteristics of each device in a state in which the device to be tested is inserted into a carrier.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">That is, the electrical test of the device is performed through electrical contact between the ball terminals of the device loaded in the carrier and probe pins supported on a socket assembly. At this time, the ball terminals and the probe pins of a very small size are arranged in a narrow pitch, so very high precision alignment is required during testing. However, the ball terminals and the probe pins are aligned through the mutual alignment of the alignment holes of the carrier and the alignment pins of the socket guide.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">(Patent Document 0001) Korean Reg.

axis directions by a base plate position adjusting means after loading all the devices to be tested on the top surface of the base plate to which vacuum pressure is applied through the openings formed in a jig plate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">Another objective of the present invention is to enable electrical testing of a plurality of devices by moving a base plate to a tester side in a state, in which the positions of the plurality of devices are aligned and the plurality of devices are adsorbed to the base plate by vacuum pressure, and then connecting the ball terminals of the plurality of devices adsorbed to the base plate to the terminals of a tester at the same time, thereby classifying good products and defective products according to the results.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">In order to achieve the objectives, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for aligning a device having a fine pitch, including a base plate, which has vacuum holes respectively formed at seating points for devices and suctions the devices with vacuum pressure that allows minute movement as the vacuum pressure is applied in a state in which the devices are loaded, a jig plate, which is fixedly installed so as to be positioned on the upper portion of the base plate and has openings, in which the devices are received, in the same number as the number of the devices loaded on the base plate, and a base plate position adjusting means for finely moving the positions of the devices loaded on the base plate in X-Y-&#x3b8; directions so as to position the devices in the openings formed in the jig plate, wherein the base plate is finely moved in the X-Y-&#x3b8; directions by the base plate position adjusting means in a state, in which the devices are received in the respective openings formed in the jig plate and suctioned to the base plate, so that the plurality of devices are aligned at the same time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for testing a device having a fine pitch, including a frame, a loading part and an unloading part provided at both ends of the frame, a jig plate, which is installed in the loading part and has a plurality of openings in which a plurality of devices <b>30</b> are received, an aligner for aligning the plurality of devices received in the openings of the jig plate, a Z-axis motor for lifting or lowering the aligner, a rail installed over the loading part and the unloading part, a transfer means, on which the Z-axis motor is fixed and which moves horizontally along the rail, and a tester for testing the performance of the plurality of devices aligned by the aligner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for aligning a device having a fine pitch, including the steps of sequentially loading devices on the upper surface of a base plate having vacuum holes through each of a plurality of openings formed in a jig plate, suctioning the devices with vacuum pressure that allows minute movement as the vacuum pressure is applied in a state in which the devices are loaded, and moving the base plate finely in X-Y-&#x3b8; directions by a base plate position adjusting means so as to align the devices by guiding each of the devices to two sides of each of the openings, wherein the devices loaded on the base plate are aligned at the same time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">The present invention has the following advantages over the prior art.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">First, a plurality of devices was sequentially loaded onto the base plate and then suctioned with vacuum pressure that allows fine movement, and in a state in which the devices suctioned to the base plate are inserted in the openings of the jig plate, the base plate is moved finely in the X-Y-&#x3b8; directions by the base plate position adjusting means so that the plurality of devices is aligned at the same time, thereby maximizing the utilization ratio of the equipment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">Second, testing is performed by electrically connecting a plurality of devices to a tester at the same time without using any separate carrier so that mismatching or offset between the ball terminals of the devices and the probe pins is prevented in advance and the test efficiency of the expensive equipment is maximized.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">Third, the alignment precision is maximized owing to the excellent positioning performance of the base plate position adjusting means and frictional force reduction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view for showing an embodiment of the present invention,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>are plan views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> excluding a jig plate and a base plate, respectively,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view for showing another embodiment of the present invention,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>are a front view and a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, respectively,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>is a plan view for showing a state in which devices are inserted into the openings of a jig plate and seated on a base plate in the present invention,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>is a view for showing a state in which device alignment is completed in the openings formed in the jig plate by finely moving the base plate in X-Y-&#x3b8;
