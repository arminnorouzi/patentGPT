These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases, a UE may operate over one or more wireless connections, which may share a same buffer. The buffer may, for example, store a number of received packets for the wireless connections, and some downlink throughput may be lost if retransmission of missed packets are not received before the buffer is flushed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support techniques for reducing a feedback time for communications over multiple wireless connections. Generally, the described techniques provide for entering a fast-negative acknowledgement (NACK) mode. For example, a user equipment (UE) may enter a fast-NACK mode and may decrease a value of a respective radio link control (RLC) timer for one or more wireless connections (e.g., may decrease the RLC timer independently for each connection). In some cases, the RLC timer (e.g., or a value thereof) may be referred to as a retransmission request time duration. Decreasing the RLC timer may be referred to as entering a fast-NACK mode, and may result in requesting retransmission of any missed packets earlier. In some cases, the UE may additionally, or alternatively, be configured with two or more component carriers (CCs) for a same wireless connection, and may determine a value of the decreased RLC timer based on a respective numerology for one or more of the CCs that may be associated with a missed packet. The UE may determine to enter the fast-NACK mode for one or both of the wireless connections. Based on entering the fast-NACK mode, the UE may override a configured RLC timer for the respective wireless connection with a new, shorter timer. Based on expiration of the new timer, the UE may transmit an RLC NACK to a base station via the corresponding wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for wireless communications at a UE is described. The method may include receiving, for a first connection, first control signaling indicating a first retransmission request time duration for requesting packet retransmission relative to when a packet in a first subset of a sequence of packets is determined to be unsuccessfully received via the first connection, receiving, for a second connection, second control signaling indicating a second retransmission request time duration for requesting packet retransmission relative to when a packet in a second subset of the sequence of packets is determined to be unsuccessfully received via the second connection, and transmitting, prior to expiration of the first retransmission request time duration, a first retransmission request to request retransmission of at least one packet in the first subset of the sequence of packets based on overriding the first retransmission request time duration with a third retransmission request time duration for the first connection, where the second retransmission request time duration is maintained for the second connection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An apparatus for wireless communications at a UE is described. The apparatus may include a processor, memory coupled with the processor, and instructions stored in the memory.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some cases, a user equipment (UE) may communicate (e.g., transmit in the downlink and/or uplink) with one or more base stations using two or more wireless connections (e.g., may communicate with one base station using the two or more wireless connections, with a respective base station for each wireless connection). For example, the base station and the UE may communicate using a first wireless connection and a second wireless connection, which may be respectively configured by the base station. The UE may reorder downlink traffic across the two connections, for example, while a first timer is running. The downlink traffic may be represented by packets from both connections within a buffer of the UE, which may be referred to as a reordering window (e.g., because the buffer includes packets that may be reordered while in the buffer). The reordering window may be limited, in some cases (e.g., to a predetermined quantity of data that may be stored by the buffer). The downlink traffic for the two connections may include a sequence of packets, where the packets associated with the first wireless connection may include a first subset of the sequence of packets and the packets associated with the second wireless connection may include a second subset of the sequence of packets. When the timer expires, the UE may flush or empty the buffer (e.g., may terminate flow control of the connections for any missing packets) and may deliver any received data to an application layer of the UE.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A radio link control (RLC) layer of the UE may attempt to recover missing packets (e.g., holes in the data) before the timer expires, for example, by sending RLC negative acknowledgements (NACKs) when an RLC reordering timer for the respective wireless connection expires. An RLC reordering timer may represent a reordering timer configured by the base station and associated with an RLC status report that may be transmitted to the base station to request retransmission of missing packets. In some cases, the RLC timers for the wireless connections may each have a relatively larger value, such that the buffer (e.g., reordering window) may reach its capacity for storing the combined data from the two wireless connections (e.g., may be full) before expiration of the RLC reordering timer (e.g., based on buffering downlink throughput from both wireless connections). Reaching the capacity of the buffer, or reordering window, may result in flushing the buffer before the RLC layer requests retransmission to recover holes in the data. In such cases, the data may be delivered to the application layer of the UE with holes in the data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present disclosure provides techniques to increase a likelihood of recovering holes in the data before flushing the shared or combined buffer. For example, the UE may enter a fast-NACK mode and may decrease a value of the respective RLC timer for one or both wireless connections (e.g., may decrease the RLC timer independently for each connection). Decreasing the RLC timer may be referred to as entering a fast-NACK mode, and may result in requesting retransmission of any missed packets before the shared buffer is filled. For example, the UE may identify a reordering window (e.g., an amount of data in the reordering window) that is maintained in the buffer based on a hole in data received via the first wireless connection. If the identified reordering window satisfies (e.g., exceeds, or meets or exceeds) a threshold, the UE may enter the fast-NACK mode. Additionally, or alternatively, the UE may enter the fast-NACK mode if the network (e.g., the base station) configures the respective RLC timer within a threshold of the corresponding first timer. In some cases, the UE may additionally, or alternatively, be configured with two or more component carriers (CCs) for a same wireless connection, and may determine a value of the decreased RLC timer based on a respective numerology for one or more of the CCs that may be associated with a missed packet.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The UE may determine to enter the fast-NACK mode for one or both of the wireless connections. Based on entering the fast-NACK mode, the UE may override a configured RLC timer for the respective wireless connection with a new, shorter timer. Based on expiration of the new timer, the UE may transmit an RLC NACK to the base station via the corresponding wireless connection. As described herein, the RLC NACK may be transmitted such that the transmission thereof may result in a higher downlink throughput.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems. Aspects of the disclosure are further illustrated by and described with reference to sequences of packets, an error detection scheme, process flows, apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to techniques for reducing a feedback time for communications over multiple wireless connections.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b> that supports techniques for reducing a feedback time for communications over multiple wireless connections in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include one or more base stations <b>105</b>, one or more UEs <b>115</b>, and a core network <b>130</b>. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, an LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) network, an LTE-A Pro network, or a New Radio (NR) network. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support enhanced broadband communications, ultra-reliable (e.g., mission critical) communications, low latency communications, communications with low-cost and low-complexity devices, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The base stations <b>105</b> may be dispersed throughout a geographic area to form the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. The base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may wirelessly communicate via one or more communication links <b>125</b>. Each base station <b>105</b> may provide a coverage area <b>110</b> over which the UEs <b>115</b> and the base station <b>105</b> may establish one or more communication links <b>125</b>. The coverage area <b>110</b> may be an example of a geographic area over which a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may support the communication of signals according to one or more radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout a coverage area <b>110</b> of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary, or mobile, or both at different times. The UEs <b>115</b> may be devices in different forms or having different capabilities. Some example UEs <b>115</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b>, the base stations <b>105</b>, or network equipment (e.g., core network nodes, relay devices, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) nodes, or other network equipment), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b>, or with one another, or both. For example, the base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through one or more backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an S1, N2, N3, or other interface). The base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over the backhaul links <b>120</b> (e.g., via an X2, Xn, or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>), or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>), or both. In some examples, the backhaul links <b>120</b> may be or include one or more wireless links.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">One or more of the base stations <b>105</b> described herein may include or may be referred to by a person having ordinary skill in the art as a base transceiver station, a radio base station, an access point, a radio transceiver, a NodeB, an eNodeB (eNB), a next-generation NodeB or a giga-NodeB (either of which may be referred to as a gNB), a Home NodeB, a Home eNodeB, or other suitable terminology.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A UE <b>115</b> may include or may be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client, among other examples. A UE <b>115</b> may also include or may be referred to as a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may include or be referred to as a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or a machine type communications (MTC) device, among other examples, which may be implemented in various objects such as appliances, or vehicles, meters, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The UEs <b>115</b> described herein may be able to communicate with various types of devices, such as other UEs <b>115</b> that may sometimes act as relays as well as the base stations <b>105</b> and the network equipment including macro eNBs or gNBs, small cell eNBs or gNBs, or relay base stations, among other examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may wirelessly communicate with one another via one or more communication links <b>125</b> over one or more carriers. The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may include one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally, or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a device-to-device (D2D) communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to IP services <b>150</b> for one or more network operators. The IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally, or alternatively, an antenna panel may support radio frequency beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. An RLC layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback is one technique for increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise conditions). In some examples, a device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">HARQ feedback may represent a MAC layer flow control, in which packets (e.g., MAC service data units (SDUs)) may be passed from the MAC layer to the RLC and/or PDCP layer(s) upon successful decoding of the packets by the MAC layer. In some cases (e.g., when communicating via multiple wireless connections or multiple CCs) a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple HARQ processes, such that the UE <b>115</b> may perform RLC and/or PDCP reordering of the received packets at the RLC and/or PDCP layer(s) (e.g., reordering of the received packets from the multiple HARQ processes). For example, some HARQ processes may successfully transfer a packet to the RLC and/or PDCP layer(s), while others may perform multiple retransmissions before transferring to the RLC and/or PDCP layer(s) or may fail and may not be transferred to the RLC and/or PDCP layer(s).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A UE <b>115</b> may enter a fast-NACK mode for RLC and/or PDCP packet reordering, and may decrease a value of a respective RLC timer for one or more wireless connections (e.g., may decrease the RLC timer independently for each connection). Decreasing the RLC timer may be referred to as entering a fast-NACK mode, and may result in requesting retransmission of any missed packets before a shared buffer is filled. In some cases, the UE <b>115</b> may be configured with two or more CCs for a same wireless connection, and may determine a value of the decreased RLC timer based on a respective numerology for one or more of the CCs that may be associated with a missed packet. The UE <b>115</b> may determine to enter the fast-NACK mode for one or both of the wireless connections. Based on entering the fast-NACK mode, the UE <b>115</b> may override a configured RLC timer for the respective wireless connection with a new, shorter timer. Based on expiration of the new timer, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit an RLC NACK to a base station <b>105</b> via the corresponding wireless connection. As described herein, the RLC NACK may be transmitted such that the transmission thereof may result in a higher downlink throughput.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>200</b> that supports techniques for reducing a feedback time for communications over multiple wireless connections in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. Wireless communications system <b>200</b> may include a base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and a UE <b>115</b>-<i>a</i>, which may represent examples of a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some cases, base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may operate in a dual connectivity (DC) mode, such as evolved terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) NR dual connectivity (EN-DC) or NR dual connectivity (NR-DC) (e.g., among other examples). In the DC mode, base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may communicate (e.g., transmit in the downlink and/or uplink) using two or more wireless connections. It is to be understood that while the examples described herein refer to one base station <b>105</b> (e.g., base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>), these examples may equally apply to multiple base stations <b>105</b> (e.g., including base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>) with which UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may communicate in the DC mode (e.g., UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may communicate with a respective base station <b>105</b> for each wireless connection).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>and UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may communicate using a first wireless connection <b>215</b> and a second wireless connection <b>220</b>, which may be respectively configured by base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>. In such a DC configuration (e.g., EN-DC or NR-DC), a PDCP layer of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may reorder downlink traffic across the two connections, for example, while a PDCP reordering timer (e.g., a t-reordering timer) is running. The downlink traffic may be represented by packets or PDUs from both connections within a buffer of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a</i>, which may be referred to as a PDCP reordering window (e.g., because the buffer includes packets that may be reordered while in the buffer). The reordering window may be limited, in some cases (e.g., to a predetermined quantity of data that may be stored by the buffer). The downlink traffic for the two connections may include a sequence of packets or PDUs, where the packets associated with the first wireless connection <b>215</b> may include a first subset of the sequence of packets and the packets associated with the second wireless connection <b>220</b> may include a second subset of the sequence of packets. When the PDCP reordering timer expires, the PDCP layer may flush or empty the buffer (e.g., may terminate flow control of the connections for any missing packets) and may deliver the received data to an application layer of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An RLC layer of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may attempt to recover missing packets or PDUs (e.g., holes in the data) before the PDCP reordering timer expires, for example, by sending RLC NACKs when an RLC reordering timer for the respective wireless connection expires. An RLC reordering timer may represent a reordering timer (e.g., t-reordering for LTE or t-reassembly for NR) associated with an RLC status report that may be transmitted to base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>(e.g., to request retransmission of missing packets or PDUs). For example, the respective RLC reordering timer may be started (e.g., by UE <b>115</b>-<i>a</i>) when a packet (e.g., a PDU) in a first subset of a sequence of packets is determined to be unsuccessfully received via a corresponding connection (e.g., when UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>has missed the packet or PDU). At expiration of the respective RLC reordering timer, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may transmit a retransmission request to base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>for the missed packet or PDU (e.g., among other missed packets or PDUs).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The RLC timer for each wireless connection may be configured by base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>via configuration signaling <b>205</b> (e.g., RRC signaling) over a respective wireless connection. For example, a first RLC timer for the first wireless connection <b>215</b> may be configured via configuration signaling <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and a second RLC timer for the second wireless connection <b>220</b> may be configured via configuration signaling <b>205</b>-<i>b</i>. In some cases, configuration signaling <b>205</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>205</b>-<i>b </i>may be received via a same connection or via a same transmission.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some cases, the RLC timers for the wireless connections may each have a relatively larger value, such that the buffer (e.g., reordering window) may reach its capacity for storing the combined data from the two wireless connections (e.g., may be full) before expiration of the RLC reordering timer (e.g., based on buffering downlink throughput from both wireless connections). Reaching the capacity of the buffer, or reordering window, may result in flushing the buffer before the RLC layer requests retransmission to recover holes in the data (e.g., to recover any missing packets or PDUs). In such cases, the data may be delivered to the application layer of UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>with holes in the data, which may degrade transmission control protocol (TCP) throughput for UE <b>115</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, in some cases, downlink DC communications (e.g., via NR and LTE) may have a peak throughput, such as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps). In some cases, a hole in the downlink data may occur via one of the wireless connections (e.g., on LTE), and the corresponding RLC timer for the connection (e.g., t-reassembly) may be greater than a given value (e.g., 24 ms). In such cases, a reordering window may go beyond an available buffer space (e.g., may go beyond 30 megabytes (MB)), or an available reordering window budget, in order to request retransmission for the missed data.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The present disclosure provides techniques to increase a likelihood of recovering holes in the data before delivering the data to the application (e.g., before flushing the shared or combined buffer). For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter a fast-NACK mode and may decrease a value of the respective RLC timer for one or both wireless connections (e.g., may decrease the RLC timer independently for each connection). Decreasing the RLC timer may be referred to as entering a fast-NACK mode, and may result in requesting retransmission of any missed packets (e.g., PDUs) earlier, which may reduce the likelihood for the buffer to be filled. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may identify a reordering window (e.g., an amount of data in the reordering window) that is maintained in the buffer based on a hole in data received via the first wireless connection <b>215</b>. If the identified reordering window satisfies (e.g., exceeds, or meets or exceeds) a threshold, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the fast-NACK mode. Additionally, or alternatively, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the fast-NACK mode if the network (e.g., base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>) configures the respective RLC timer within a threshold of the corresponding PDCP timer (e.g., having a value close to the PDCP timer). In some cases, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may additionally, or alternatively be configured with two or more CCs for a same wireless connection, and may determine a value of the decreased RLC timer based on a respective numerology for one or more of the CCs that may be associated with a missed packet.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The fast-NACK mode may increase downlink throughput and may, for example, be configured to balance between throughput loss due to buffer flushing (e.g., as described herein) when the RLC timer is longer (e.g., NACK requests are less frequent) and throughput loss due to receiving duplicate RLC data when the RLC timer is shorter (e.g., NACK requests are more frequent or aggressive). Throughput loss may occur when the RLC timer is shorter, for example, if a NACK is sent to base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>while HARQ recovery of the data is ongoing, such that duplicate data may be received by UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>based on a HARQ retransmission and an RLC retransmission (e.g., if both retransmissions from base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>are successful).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The fast-NACK mode may include one or more levels, where each level may be associated with a different value for the RLC timer (e.g., a different level of aggressiveness for sending a NACK). For example, the fast-NACK mode may be off, may be at a first level (e.g., Level 0), may be at a second level (e.g., Level 1), or may be at a third level (e.g., Level 2), based on one or more parameters. As described herein, when the fast-NACK mode is off the RLC timers may be maintained at a same value as configured by base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>(e.g., via an RRC configuration). Entering the first level (e.g., Level 0) of the fast-NACK mode may be based on UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>determining that one or more of the RLC timers configured by base station <b>105</b>-<i>a </i>are too large (e.g., the one or more RLC timers each satisfy a corresponding threshold amount of time, such as by meeting or exceeding the threshold time).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may compare the configured RLC timer for a wireless connection to a threshold that represents a respective multiple of a HARQ round trip time (RTT) for the wireless connection (e.g., k times the HARQ RTT, where k may be equal to three, four, five, etc.). If the RLC timer is greater than or equal to the respective threshold, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may trim or reduce the one or more RLC timers. A HARQ RTT for a respective connection may be determined dynamically and empirically, for example, from past HARQ RTTs, as well as from estimates based on one or more variables. In some cases, the HARQ RTT for the connection may include an upper bound and a lower bound (e.g., as estimated) for the HARQ RTT. A HARQ RTT as described herein may be affected by (e.g., may depend on) whether a corresponding wireless connection is associated with a TDD or an FDD mode, a technology for the connection (e.g., LTE or NR), a numerology for the connection, a number of HARQ processes for the connection, or whether the HARQ for the connection is synchronous, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Because entering the first level may be based on a respective threshold for each of the configured RLC timers, the first level may not be based on a reordering window or a reordering window size for either wireless connection (e.g., or for both wireless connections). In some cases, based on the configuration of the RLC timers (e.g., as configured by base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>), a base fast-NACK level for UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may either be off or may be the first level (e.g., based on whether one or more RLC timers satisfy the respective threshold time). In such cases, there may be no switching back and forth between the off mode and the first level for fast-NACK (e.g., because one or the other may always be in operation, such as by default based on the configured values of the RLC timers).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Entering the second level (e.g., Level 1) or the third level (e.g., Level 2) of the fast-NACK mode for a wireless connection may be based on UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>identifying an amount of the buffer or reordering window (e.g., amount of data in the buffer) that may be attributed to the wireless connection (e.g., connection i). For example, for a wireless connection i (e.g., the first wireless connection <b>215</b> or the second wireless connection <b>220</b>), UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may determine an amount of data (e.g., an amount of packets or PDUs) of a corresponding reordering window (e.g., R<sub>i</sub>) that may be attributed to the wireless connection i. If the reordering window (e.g., a sequence or an amount of packets or data) attributed to the connection satisfies a first threshold (e.g., a threshold number of packets or data) associated with the connection (e.g., a threshold R<sub>1,i</sub>), UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the second level of the fast-NACK mode. If the reordering window attributed to the connection satisfies a second threshold associated with the connection (e.g., a threshold R<sub>2,i</sub>), UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the third level of the fast-NACK mode.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the fast-NACK mode and may send RLC NACKs to base station <b>105</b>-<i>a</i>, for example, as long as an RLC hole (e.g., missing packets or PDUs) remains. In some cases, however, the hole may not be filled (e.g., any missing packets or PDUs may not be received) after expiration of the original RLC timer (e.g., t-reassembly, t-reordering). If there is only one hole (e.g., a hole X) the RLC timer may not be restarted upon expiration, such that UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may not send further RLC NACKs until polled by the network. In such cases, if a polling interval for the network is much greater than a t-statusProhibit timer, a delay until a next RLC NACK is sent may become relatively large. In order to reduce such delays, if there is an unrecovered hole (e.g., missing packets or PDUs) associated with a wireless connection, upon expiration of the original RLC timer UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may restart the RLC timer when a next RLC PDU arrives on the wireless connection. Additionally, or alternatively, if there is an unrecovered hole (e.g., missing packets or PDUs) associated with a wireless connection, upon expiration of the original RLC timer UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may restart the RLC timer (e.g., immediately), using a timer value associated with a fast-NACK level being used by UE <b>115</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The thresholds for entering the second and third levels of the fast-NACK mode may be dynamic for the respective connection and may, for example, be based on a HARQ RTT for the connection and a total downlink throughput, among other examples. In such cases, different HARQ RTTs for different numerologies (e.g., NR numerologies, such as subcarrier spacing and cyclic prefixes) may result in different thresholds for each numerology (e.g., for each different NR numerology, as well as for LTE). Because the thresholds for entering the second level and the third level may be based on the HARQ RTT for a given connection, different wireless connections may be associated with different, respective thresholds for entering the second level and/or the third level. For example, the first wireless connection <b>215</b> may be associated with a first threshold for entering the second level and the second wireless connection <b>220</b> may be associated with a second threshold for entering the second level.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As such, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may, in some cases, enter a fast-NACK mode (e.g., the second or third level of fast-NACK) for one wireless connection while maintaining its configured RLC timers for the other wireless connection (e.g., based on the different thresholds for entering the fast-NACK mode). For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may enter the second level or the third level of fast-NACK for the first wireless connection <b>215</b>, while maintaining fast-NACK off (e.g., maintaining the configured RLC timers) or in the first level for the second wireless connection. Upon entering a level (e.g., the first, second, or third level) of fast-NACK for a wireless connection, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may override the configured RLC timer for that wireless connection with a new, shortened timer. For example, UE <b>115</b>-<i>a </i>may replace the value of the RLC timer for the wireless connection with a new value for the timer. The value of the new timer (e.g., new RLC timer) may be based on HARQ RTT for the wireless connection, and may therefore correspond to the numerology for the connection (e.g., be tailored to LTE, or to different numerologies for NR).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When overriding the configured RLC timer (e.g., replacing the timer value), the new RLC timer (e.g., t-reassembly, t-reordering) for the fast-NACK mode (e.g., for the first, second, or third level of fast-NACK) may be large enough to support a relatively high probability of HARQ recovery of any missing packets or data. For example, the new RLC timer may be configured to wait for a defined number of HARQ retransmissions (e.g., a number of HARQ RTTs), such that a success of the HARQ process may be increased (e.g., may be maximized). Doing so may also reduce (e.g., minimize) throughput loss due to RLC duplicates of HARQ retransmissions.

For example, when a HARQ error (e.g., a missing packet, RLC hole) on a first transmission is detected for a respective CC, layer <b>1</b> (L1) of the UE <b>115</b> may send an indication of a CC identifier (ID) for the CC to the RLC layer of the UE <b>115</b>. For example, the L1 of the UE <b>115</b> may detect one or more first (e.g., initial) HARQ transmission errors <b>410</b> within a first time frame <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>or within a second time frame <b>405</b>-<i>b </i>and may send a hole detection <b>415</b> notification to the RLC layer of the UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0135">When configured with multiple CCs, the UE <b>115</b> may use one or more techniques as described herein to determine a HARQ RTT for the fast-NACK parameters. For example, if the RLC hole detected by the UE <b>115</b> is associated with an L1 indication from two or more CCs, and if each of the two or more CCs has the same numerology, the UE <b>115</b> may set the HARQ RTT based on the common numerology of the two or more CCs. If the RLC hole detected by the UE <b>115</b> is associated with an L1 indication from two or more CCs, and if each of the two or more CCs have at least one different numerology, the UE <b>115</b> may set the HARQ RTT to a highest (e.g., maximum) HARQ RTT across the numerologies of all the CCs associated with the RLC hole. If the L1 indication is from one CC, the UE <b>115</b> may set the HARQ RTT based on the numerology of the one CC. Such techniques may extend to carrier aggregation with more than two numerologies (e.g., three or more numerologies).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0136">In some cases (e.g., with multiple CCs or one CC per connection), the network (e.g., the base station <b>105</b>) may flip a new data indicator (NDI) field before a HARQ process can succeed, or the network may switch a HARD ID for a HARQ process. In such cases, L1 may send an indication to the RLC layer to expire the RLC timer and immediately send an RLC NACK. Before expiring the timer, the UE <b>115</b> may ensure that all CCs associated with a HARQ error (e.g., mapped to the RLC hole) have either had a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) success or have failed HARQ.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0137">As described herein, the UE <b>115</b> may use the HARQ RTT to determine one or more parameters (e.g., thresholds, timer values) associated with the fast-NACK mode. In such cases, if a threshold (e.g., based on the HARQ RTT) is satisfied (e.g., is met or exceeded), the UE <b>115</b> may enter the fast-NACK mode and may set a new RLC timer value based on the HARQ RTT.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a process flow <b>500</b> that supports techniques for reducing a feedback time for communications over multiple wireless connections in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.
