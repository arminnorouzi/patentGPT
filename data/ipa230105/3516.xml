In contrast, some scales may be formed by the co-mingling of incompatible fluids such as when barite (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) is precipitated by mixing injected high sulfate seawater with formation brines that contain barium cations.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some of the more common oilfield scales include calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), barite (BaSO<sub>4</sub>), celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>), anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), iron sulphide (FeS), and halite (NaCl). Less common oilfield scales include aragonite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), vaterite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>), fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), and various oxides, hydroxides and silicates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the most common method used to determine scale thickness is a direct and destructive measurement that includes exposing, preparing, and examining test sample cross sections using optical or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For example, Al-Aithan, G. H. et al., &#x201c;A Mechanistic Erosion-Corrosion Model for Predicting Iron Carbonate (FeCO<sub>3</sub>) Sale Thickness in a CO<sub>2 </sub>Environment with Sand&#x201d;, NACE Corrosion paper 3854, 2014 describes the analysis of FeCO<sub>3 </sub>scale formed on AISI 1018 carbon steel immersed in 2 wt % NaCl/1900 ppm NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>at 65 and 93&#xb0; C. and 241.3 KPa CO<sub>2</sub>. The specimens, with scale formed, were mounted in epoxy, cross sectioned, polished, and the scale thicknesses was measured directly from SEM images. In addition to being a time consuming test, this direct method can be a challenge in term of sampling statistics.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other methods that have been used to determine scale thickness include electrolytic reduction, ultrasonics, and temperature differential measurements. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,558 describes an electrolytic reduction of an electrically insulative metal oxide deposited on an electrically conductive metal substrate. The electrolytic reduction requires the removal of the oxide, and the thickness of the oxide coating is determined by measuring the cell voltage change and elapsed time of reduction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 4,669,310 describes the use of time-of-flight ultrasonic pulsing to detect and measure oxide scale on the inner cylindrical surface of a fluid containing boiler tube. This is achieved by positioning an ultrasonic transducer on the outer surface of the boiler tube, and the device then measures the buildup of scale on the inner surface. This ultrasonic method cannot be used to measure scale thickness from the scaled surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 9,568,375 describes a temperature differential method to determine scale thickness in a liquid system, such as a heat exchanger. By comparing the temperature differential between two sensors on heated, wetted surfaces with and without scale, the thickness of scale on a scaled substrate can be determined based on the reduced heat transfer though the heated, wetted surface caused by the accumulated scale. In this method, sensors are positioned on and project through a conduit wall, flush with the inside of the conduit wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to scaling, corrosion may occur within a well environment. For instance, significant corrosion may also occur on steel substrates (e.g., casing, drill pipe, coiled tubing) exposed to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) rich aqueous systems. The dissolution of CO<sub>2 </sub>in water results in the formation of carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) which partially dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) providing H<sup>+</sup> ions which drive the corrosion reaction. The oxidation of iron (Fe) from the steel surface produces Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and when the concentrations of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212; </sup>ions exceed the solubility limit, precipitation occurs on the steel surface to form a FeCO<sub>3 </sub>film. The film acts as a diffusion barrier for corrosive species, reducing the corrosion rate of the steel. A dense and protective scale may form when the rate of precipitation is faster than the corrosion rate. In contrast, a porous, non-protective corrosion product layer may form when the corrosion rate is faster than the precipitation rate. Similarly, a high supersaturation of ions can result in a thin, well adhered surface film while at low ion supersaturation, fewer nucleation sites and slower crystal growth results in a less adherent, less protective film.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The protectiveness, rate of precipitation, and stability of the FeCO<sub>3 </sub>film is influenced by the composition and microstructure of the base alloy, and characteristics of the corrosive environment such as temperature, CO<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure, pH, and flow rate. For example, the precipitation of FeCO<sub>3 </sub>is facilitated and the rate of scaling is increased by increasing the pH and temperature and by reducing the rate of transport of reactant and corrosion products to and from the steel surface. The scale that forms at higher temperature (e.g., at or above 60&#xb0; C.) can be more adherent and protective than that formed at a lower temperature. When conditions are favorable for the formation of FeCO<sub>3 </sub>scale, increasing the partial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>can also result in accelerated precipitation of FeCO<sub>3</sub>. Corrosion products may be various oxides, hydroxides, etc., and mixtures with the more corrosion resistant phases in the metal or alloy (e.g., enrichment of the surface with metal carbides such as iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Pitting corrosion can occur when the FeCO<sub>3 </sub>film is not continuous due to being formed under conditions that favor porous films with low adherence to the surface such as low temperature, low pH, and low ion supersaturation. A film with low adherence can cause a separation between the metal and the scale, allowing the solution to penetrate and contact a large metal area below the scale. This contact enables &#x201c;under-scale&#x201d; corrosion to continue even though scale coverage of the metal appears to be complete. Similarly, any mechanical damage to the protective FeCO<sub>3 </sub>film that exposes the underlying metal to an aggressive corrosive environment will likely lead to localized corrosion. The presence of Calcium (Ca) can also lead to localized corrosion since Ca<sup>2+ </sup>can incorporate into the FeCO<sub>3 </sub>structure and, at sufficient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations, the mixed metal carbonate may not be protective.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Iron sulphide (FeS) scale can be formed due to hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) corrosion of carbon steel, or the reaction of sulphide with free ferrous ions. The low solubility and fast precipitation kinetics of FeS lead to accumulation of the scale on steel, accelerating pitting and crevice corrosion. The precipitation of FeS is enhanced by a lower flow rate, a higher temperature, and a higher ionic strength. Higher temperatures (e.g., at or above 70&#xb0; C.), can significantly promote H<sub>2</sub>S corrosion, FeS deposition, and FeS scale retention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below.

Therefore, measurements can be conveniently taken on site using a portable device, such as an analyzing downhole tool on a rig site.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another feature of using XRF measurements according to the present disclosure to determine deposit layer thickness is that, unlike direct methods such as SEM, XRF measurements can be non-destructive as no cutting or cross-sectioning is used to assess the nature of the scale/corrosion. As a result, the sample, tool, or piece of equipment to be analyzed can stay intact and may even be returned into service to perform its function when the analysis indicates an acceptable (e.g., acceptably low) level of scale/corrosion.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">XRF analysis can be limited by the maximum depth of analysis of the corresponding XRF device; however, the inventors of the present disclosure have found that, despite this limitation, XRF spectroscopy works well for the purpose of the present disclosure and can be used to accurately and conveniently determine the thickness of a deposit layer, particularly in combination with a calibration relationship between deposit layer thickness and the elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the substrate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for measuring a thickness of a deposit layer on a metal or alloy substrate using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, wherein the deposit layer includes scale deposits, corrosion products, or both scale deposits and corrosion products. The method can include measuring an elemental composition of any one or more of the deposit layer, the metal substrate, or the alloy substrate using the XRF spectrometer and obtaining the thickness of the deposit layer from the elemental composition. Obtaining the thickness may include using a calibration relationship between deposit layer thicknesses and corresponding elemental compositions of the corresponding deposit layer, metal substrate, or alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The elemental composition may be a concentration of an element in the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate, and the calibration relationship may be a relationship between deposit layer thicknesses and corresponding concentrations of the element in the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the elemental composition may be a ratio between a concentration of an element in the deposit layer and a concentration of an element in the metal or alloy substrate, and the calibration relationship may be a relationship between deposit layer thicknesses and corresponding ratios between the concentration of the element in the deposit layer and the concentration of the element in the metal or alloy substrate. Optionally, the ratio may be between a concentration of an element enhanced in the deposit layer and a concentration of an element enhanced in substrate and obscured by deposit layer.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When establishing the calibration relationship, the deposit layer thicknesses may be measured using a direct measurement method such as SEM, and the corresponding elemental compositions of the deposit layer and/or the substrate may be measured by an XRF spectrometer. The XRF measurements on substrates with different deposit layer thicknesses may then be correlated with the corresponding deposit layer thicknesses as determined by SEM to produce the calibration relationship.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, identical test coupons made of the relevant substrate material may be produced and then exposed to a corrosive/scaling environment for varying length of time to produce test coupons with different deposit layer thicknesses. For each test coupon, an elemental composition can be determined by XRF and a corresponding deposit layer thickness can be determined by SEM. The elemental compositions and the corresponding deposit layer thicknesses of the test coupons can be used to generate a calibration relationship.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once established, the calibration relationship can be used to determine deposit layer thicknesses using XRF measurements alone, thereby potentially eliminating the use of direct measurements such as SEM in field measurements. As noted herein, SEM is a destructive test and cuts the tool to expose a cross-section, which is polished for accurate measurements of deposit layer thickness.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When an XRF spectrometer is used, the thickness of the deposit layer obtained using the calibration relationship may be an average thickness of the deposit layer. The XRF spectrometer may be a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer or an energy-dispersive XRF (EDX) spectrometer. When either is used without SEM, the thickness of the deposit layer obtained using the calibration relationship may be an average thickness of the deposit layer. When SEM-EDX is used, the thickness of the deposit layer obtained using the calibration relationship may be a localized thickness of the deposit layer, because when SEM and EDX are used together, chemical composition of a localized area in a sample may be analyzed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the analyzed scale deposit or layer of corrosion products may be reported as a concentration of scale per unit area when an average compositional analysis is made using XRF. The analyzed scale deposit or layer of corrosion products may be reported as a scaled or corrosion product thickness of the scaled or corroded regions, when compositional analysis of scaled or corroded regions is made using SEM-EDX.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The deposit layer may include inorganic scale deposits and/or corrosion products. By way of illustration, inorganic scale deposits may include at least one of calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), barite (BaSO<sub>4</sub>), celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>), anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>), gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O), iron sulphide (FeS), halite (NaCl), aragonite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), vaterite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>) fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS), or silicate scales. The inorganic corrosion products may include at least one of oxides, hydroxides, or carbides.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the same or other embodiments, the deposit layer may include organic deposits. The method may be used to analyze organic deposits where the elements associated with the metal/alloy substrate are increasingly obscured as the organic scale forms and builds up on the surface. In addition, the organic scale may contain XRF-detectable elements such as nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) in asphaltenic deposits or Ca in calcium naphthenate deposits.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Metal or alloy substrates used in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure may be part of a tool or equipment used in a corrosive or scaling environment. This may include tools inserted into a downhole environment to perform various oilfield operations, treatments, or measurements. For example, the substrate may be an armored housing of power cables for downhole use made of a copper nickel alloy, or may be casing, coiled tubing, drill collars, drill pipe, or the like.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the metal or alloy substrate may be test samples used to evaluate the strength of a corrosive/scaling environment and/or the performance of scale/corrosion inhibitors or other production chemicals. Such test samples may be exposed to the scaling and/or corrosive fluid environment in the laboratory or under wellbore/downhole conditions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the metal or alloy substrate is part of a tool or equipment used in a corrosive and/or scaling environment, the method may be used to obtain information used to decide when to deploy, repair (including remediation), or replace the tool or equipment. As such, the method may further include, for example, comparing the thickness of the deposit layer with a predetermined threshold and deciding whether to repair or replace the tool or equipment. In the same or other embodiments, the method may include comparing the thickness of the deposit layer with a predetermined static or dynamic threshold and triggering automatic deployment, repair, or replacement of the tool or equipment.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, monitoring of the scaling and corrosion of metal tools and/or equipment used in a corrosive/scaling environment can be used to inform operations regarding the timing of servicing. For example, it may be decided that a treatment should be performed when the thickness of the deposit layer reaches a predetermined threshold. The treatment may be triggered, or an alert may be generated, automatically when the predetermined threshold is reached. For instance, upon calculating (e.g., downhole or at the surface), that a deposit has exceeded the predetermined threshold (e.g., 3 micron, 6 micron, 12 micron, 15 micron, 20 micron, 50 micron, etc.), a sensor or computing system may initiate or request a treatment. The predetermined threshold may be a fixed thickness or may be adaptive/dynamic. For instance, the predetermined threshold may vary based on different conditions, such as the type of operation being performed, the size of the tool, the materials being used, and the like. A treatment that is performed may include any methods suitable for reducing corrosion and/or scaling such as adding scale inhibitors and/or corrosion inhibitors, a cleaning procedure, a mechanical removal procedure to remove scale deposits and/or corrosion products, or the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The methods described herein may be used to measure a rate of deposit layer formation on a metal or alloy substrate using an XRF spectrometer, where the deposit layer includes scale deposits or corrosion products. This may include obtaining a first thickness of the deposit layer and exposing the metal or alloy substrate to a scaling and/or corrosive environment for a first period. This may be repeated to obtain a second thickness of the deposit layer after the first period, and the first thickness and the second thickness can be compared and used in determining the rate of deposit layer formation on the metal or alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The rate of deposit layer formation may be calculated by dividing the difference between the first thickness and the second thickness by the length of the first period, although the first period may be any unit of time. Linear or non-linear models may be applied to calculate an instantaneous rate of deposit layer formation.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The rate of deposit layer formation may be expressed in terms of rate of corrosion and/or rate of scaling. Furthermore, the rate of corrosion and/or rate of scaling may be cumulative rate of corrosion and/or cumulative rate of scaling.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first thickness of the deposit layer may be obtained using the methods described herein (e.g., obtained from an elemental composition measurement using a calibration relationship). In other embodiments, to determine the rate of deposit layer formation on a clean metal or alloy substrate without any scale/corrosion, the first thickness of the deposit layer may be zero.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another aspect of the present disclosure includes a method for measuring a rate of deposit layer formation on a metal or alloy substrate using an XRF spectrometer, where the deposit layer includes scale deposits and/or corrosion products, and the method includes obtaining a first elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate, exposing the metal or alloy substrate to a scaling and/or corrosive environment for a first period, measuring a second elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or metal or alloy substrate using the XRF spectrometer after the first period, obtaining a first change in elemental composition by calculating the difference between the first and second elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate, and determining a first rate of deposit layer formation on the metal or alloy substrate using a calibration relationship between rates of deposit layer formation and corresponding changes in elemental composition. The rate of deposit layer formation may be expressed as a rate of corrosion and/or a rate of scaling.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The calibration relationship may be a calibration relationship between rate of deposit layer formation measured using an electrochemical method and corresponding changes in elemental composition measured using an XRF spectrometer. The electrochemical method may include linear polarization resistance. The elemental composition may be a concentration of an element in the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate or a ratio between a concentration of an element in the deposit layer and a concentration of an element in the metal or alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first change in elemental composition can be the change in elemental composition over the first period. The corresponding changes in elemental composition used when establishing the calibration relationship may be measured over the same length of time as the first period for ease of comparison. The first period may for example be one minute, five minutes, ten minutes, half an hour, an hour, two hours, five hours, ten hours, twenty-four hours, or anything therebetween. In other embodiments, the period may be less than one minute or greater than twenty-four hours. In further embodiments, the corresponding changes in elemental composition per unit time may be used when establishing the calibration relationship. A corresponding change in elemental composition per unit time may be obtained by dividing the change in element composition by the length of time over which the changes occurred. Similarly, the first change in elemental composition per unit time may be calculated by dividing the first change by the first period. The first change in elemental composition per unit time may then be used to determine a first rate of deposit layer formation using a calibration relationship between rates of deposit layer formation and corresponding change in elemental composition per unit time.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate may be obtained using an XRF spectrometer. Optionally, to determine the rate of deposit layer formation on a clean metal or alloy substrate without any scale/corrosion, the first elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate may be obtained from the manufacturer of the substrate or re-surfaced by a supplier or the entity performing the method.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The rate of deposit layer formation may be used to evaluate the strength of a scaling and/or corrosive environment on a certain type of metal/alloy substrate. For example, an environment which produces a higher rate of deposit layer formation over the same period of time under the same conditions has a stronger scaling and/or corrosive effect on the metal/alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, example methods may also include exposing the metal or alloy substrate to the scaling and/or corrosive environment for a second period, measuring a third elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate using the XRF spectrometer after the second period, obtaining a second change in elemental composition by calculating the difference between the second and third elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate, determining a second rate of deposit layer formation on the metal or alloy substrate during the second period using a calibration relationship between rates of deposit layer formation and corresponding changes in elemental composition, and determining overall rate of deposit layer formation on a metal or alloy substrate.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For ease of comparison and/or calculation, the first period may be the same as the second period, although this is merely illustrative and the first and second periods may be different. The second rate of deposit layer formation may be obtained by using the second change in elemental composition per unit time and, in establishing the calibration relationship, corresponding changes in elemental composition per unit time, or simply by selecting the second period and optionally also the first period to be unit time. Generally, a change in elemental composition per unit time may be calculated by dividing the change in elemental composition by the length of the period.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, the methods described herein may include exposing the metal or alloy substrate to the scaling and/or corrosive environment for a second period, measuring a third elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate using the XRF spectrometer after the second period, obtaining a second change in elemental composition by calculating the difference between the second and third elemental composition of the deposit layer and/or the metal or alloy substrate, determining a second rate of deposit layer formation on the metal or alloy substrate during the second period using a calibration relationship between rates of deposit layer formation and corresponding changes in elemental composition, and predicting a future rate of scaling and/or future rate of corrosion.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Again, for ease of comparison and/or calculation, the first period may be the same as the second period or may be different. The second rate of deposit layer formation may be obtained by using the second change in elemental composition per unit time and, in establishing the calibration relationship, corresponding changes in elemental composition per unit time, or simply by selecting the second period and optionally also the first period to be unit time. Generally, a change in elemental composition per unit time may be calculated by dividing the change in elemental composition by the length of the period.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In embodiments of the present disclosure the scaling and/or corrosive environment may be a downhole environment. For instance, the environment may be encountered in a well exploration, well construction, fluid production, or wellbore treatment operation.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Monitoring the scaling deposits and corrosion products remaining on tools and/or equipment after servicing/remediation allows the effectiveness of the treatment to be evaluated. Specifically, the some embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods for evaluating the effectiveness of a treatment to reduce scale deposits and/or corrosion products on a metal or alloy substrate using XRF spectrometry, where the metal or alloy substrate is exposed to a scaling and/or corrosive environment. Example methods include obtaining a first rate of corrosion and/or scaling, performing the treatment to reduce scale deposits and/or corrosion products on the metal or alloy substrate, obtaining a second rate of corrosion and/or scaling, comparing the first rate of corrosion and scaling with the second rate of corrosion and scaling, and evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment to reduce scale deposits and/or corrosion products.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An example treatment that is evaluated may include any treatment suitable for, or intended to, reduce scaling and/or corrosion, and may include adding scale inhibitors and/or corrosion inhibitors to the scaling and/or corrosive environment, a cleaning procedure, or a removal procedure. The removal procedure may be deployment of scale and corrosion product removal/treatment/cleaning strategies using chemical, chemo-mechanical, mechanical, electrical, electrochemical, or electromechanical methods. For instance, a removal procedure may include scale removal, scale dissolution, scale erosion, acid pickling, or scale blasting treatments.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Monitoring of the scaling and corrosion can be used to optimize and/or design the chemistry and performance of scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors and/or combined scale and corrosion inhibitors by evaluating relative effectiveness of different inhibitors or combinations of inhibitors.

This process causes electrons from the inner electron shells to be ejected. Electrons from outer electron shells then fill the voids, and in this process, energy is released in the form of x-rays. The number and energy of the x-rays emitted from the sample can be measured by an energy-dispersive spectrometer or a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer.

SEM produces a magnified image of the sample, which then allows EDX to carry out a localized chemical composition analysis. As a complementary or alternative technique to XRF spectroscopy, SEM-EDX can give a localized compositional analysis of the scaled and non-scaled regions separately. Thus, with SEM-EDX, a direct measurement of scale thickness can be correlated to, for example, the composition of FeCO<sub>3 </sub>in regions where scale is present to produce a localized calibration relationship.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref> show how the wt % of Si, C, O, and Fe measured by SEM-EDX respectively vary with deposit thickness measured by SEM in a calibration relationship, with point <b>500</b> representing an original sample after GBB, and points <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, and <b>524</b> representing samples after 2, 4, and 24 hours, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the Si concentrations measured by SEM-EDX are consistent with those measured by XRF and obscuration of Si in the glass bead blasted steel due to scale build up is reflected similarly in SEM-EDX measurements.

Destructive SEM methods can therefore be avoided for future measurements once the calibration relationship is established.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0101">Sulphidation of Cu&#x2014;Ni Alloy Substrate Exposed Under Downhole Conditions to H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2 </sub>at 104&#xb0; C. for 209 Days</p><p id="p-0107" num="0102">Copper nickel alloy (Monel) is a material that may be used in various applications, including to as an armor strip housing for power cables connected to an electrical submersible pump (ESP) usable in downhole artificial lift applications. In this example, a 10 cm long armor strip sample of the Monel was exposed for 209 days to conditions at 104&#xb0; C., with a pressure of 1,674 psig, in a fluid environment at 55 mol % H<sub>2</sub>S and 41 mol % CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0103">Prior to the exposure, ten XRF measurements evenly distributed on the 10 cm long armor strip sample were taken and the average of the ten measurements was calculated.

The XRF-measured average wt % of Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn on the surface of the armor strips decreased after the exposure, and the average sulfur concentration was 6.2 wt %.

Alternatively, when exposure time is equal to unit time, no calculation may be needed. An example equation for calculating the rate of deposit formation (K) may include:</p><p id="p-0114" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K</i>=(thickness<sub>aft-exp</sub>&#x2212;thickness<sub>pre-exp</sub>)/<i>t </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0115" num="0000">where thickness<sub>aft-exp </sub>is the deposit layer thickness after exposure, thickness<sub>pre-exp </sub>is the deposit layer thickness before exposure, and t is the exposure time.

This method is demonstrated in more detail in Example 3.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows how, for all ten XRF measurements on the exposed Monel armor sample surface, the sum of the mol % of Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn decreases generally linearly with the increase in mol % of sulfur. Since the exposure time is constant, these results indicate a varying degree of sulphidation of the alloy at different points on the sample surface. Thus, the sulphidation process is somewhat heterogeneous in terms of its degree and/or penetration. Moreover, the data indicates that approximately 0.2 mol (Cu, Ni, Fe, Mn) reacts with approximately 0.3 mol S, suggesting an average metal sulphide composition of (Cu, Ni, Fe, Mn)S<sub>1.5</sub>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0111">As apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, there are two distinct outliers in the mol % (Cu+Ni+Fe+Mn) versus mol % S relationship, namely when the mol % sulfur is about 0.19 and about 0.28.

However, it is understood that the method can be used to monitor the growth of various types of scale on numerous metal/alloy substrates, provided that there is a differentiating XRF-detectable element in the scale and/or the substrate. The XRF instrument may not quantify some lighter elements such as carbon and oxygen but, in contrast, SEM-EDX will report weight percentages of these light elements. As a result, when the differentiating element in the scale and/or the substrate involves a lighter element that's not readily detectable by XRF, SEM-EDX may be used instead of or to supplement XRF.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0113">Development of corrosion products on carbon steel substrate exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated brine at 70&#xb0; C. without corrosion inhibitors</p><p id="p-0121" num="0114">A low carbon AISI SAE 1018 steel with a manufacturer's composition specification of 0.14-0.20 wt % carbon, 98.81-99.26 wt % iron, 0.60-0.90 wt % manganese, &#x2264;0.040 wt % phosphorous, and &#x2264;0.050 wt % sulfur, was the substrate material.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0115">After the carbon steel samples were polished with P1200 silicon carbide paper and before being exposed to a corrosive environment, XRF analyses of the bulk C-steel gave the following elemental composition (wt %) for three different samples:</p><p id="p-0123" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Fe</entry><entry>Mn</entry><entry>Cu</entry><entry>Cr</entry><entry>Ni</entry><entry>Mo</entry><entry>Sn</entry><entry>P</entry><entry>Si</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Sample 1</entry><entry>97.55</entry><entry>0.806</entry><entry>0.148</entry><entry>0.094</entry><entry>0.107</entry><entry>0.026</entry><entry>0.017</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.482</entry></row><row><entry>Sample 2</entry><entry>97.34</entry><entry>0.792</entry><entry>0.156</entry><entry>0.097</entry><entry>0.104</entry><entry>0.025</entry><entry>0.017</entry><entry>0.024</entry><entry>0.676</entry></row><row><entry>Sample 3</entry><entry>98.04</entry><entry>0.748</entry><entry>0.06</entry><entry>0.04</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.008</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>0.356</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>Samples were then exposed to CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated 3% NaCl brine at 70&#xb0; C. for 2, 5, 7, and 24 hours respectively.

Thus, it should be understood that storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0145">It is to be understood that the disclosure herein provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, but may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed or provide between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0146">Embodiments of the present disclosure may be described as a process that may include various acts, or which can be depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a data flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a process or flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed at least partially in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process may terminate or restart when its operations are completed, but could have additional steps not included in the description or figure, or some or all of the steps may be repeated through an iterative process. A process may correspond to a method, a function, a procedure, a subroutine, a subprogram, etc. When a process or act corresponds to a function, its termination can correspond to a return of the function to the calling function or a main function.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0147">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;having&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, and the like are intended to be open-ended, whereas the term &#x201c;consisting&#x201d; is closed. Thus, a method having/including/comprising three elements may include more than the three elements, whereas a method consisting of the three elements would include only the recited three elements. The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein is not intended to be mutually exclusive of recited options, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, a method including A or B would include A alone, B alone, or A and B. In contrast, a method including a single one of A or B would include A lone or B alone, but not A and B.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0148">The foregoing outlines features of several embodiments so that those skilled in the art may better understand the aspects of the present disclosure.
