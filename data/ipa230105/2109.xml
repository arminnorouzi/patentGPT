More specifically, the present invention is directed to packaging that may enclose or package a stored value card&#x2014;digital or physical&#x2014;with customizable panels or surfaces.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Giving gifts during holidays and certain events has been a part of culture and celebrations for generations. It is widely common to obscure the gift, for example by using wrapping paper, a gift bag, etc., to make the gift a surprise and/or increase excitement and intrigue around the gift giving process.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transaction cards, stored value cards, or gift cards, as they are commonly called based upon their intended use, have become popular gifts. Gift cards typically comprise a stored value card associated with a certain cash equivalent value. Such value may be encoded upon a magnetic strip, bar code, or chip applied to the surface of the card, or may be associated with an account number or indicia present on the card. This stored value may be determined by the vendor prior to packaging and display for sale or, more commonly, is selected at the point of sale by the purchaser and loaded by the cashier by activating an account associated with the card or account number present on the card.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While popular, gift cards are typically provided with a generic and impersonal design, typically identifying an associated merchant for which the card may be used to purchase merchandise or even channel of redemption (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.), and therefore are not personalized in view of the intended recipient. Various gift card packages have been introduced, but such packages are generally also generic and impersonal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide for packaging of transaction cards and stored value cards in a means that is both exciting and may be personalized by a giver. Such personalized packaging may also reduce the need for the additional purchase of a greeting card or tag, thereby potentially reducing costs and material consumption.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, aspects may include a package for a value item, at least a portion of the package comprising a removable layer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, aspects may include a greeting card comprising a value item, wherein at least a portion of the greeting card comprises a removable layer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, aspects may include a value item packaging system, comprising: a package for a value item, the package comprising a substrate with colors or patterns printed thereon, and a removable layer disposed on top of, and at least partially obscuring, the colors or patterns, the package at least partially enclosing the item; and a stylus, the stylus configured to scrape or scratch away at least a portion of the removable layer thereby showing the colors or patterns printed beneath</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, aspects may include a packaging system, comprising: a package comprising a box and a lid, the box and the lid comprised of a substrate; the substrate of the lid at least partially covered by a liner, the liner having: colors or patterns printed thereon; and a removable layer disposed on top of, and at least partially obscuring, the colors or patterns; and a stylus, the stylus configured to scrape or scratch away at least a portion of the removable layer thereby showing the colors or patterns printed beneath.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other aspects will become apparent from the following description of the invention taken in conjunction with the following drawings, although variations and modifications may be affected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention can be more fully understood by reading the following detailed description together with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference indicators are used to designate like elements.

Descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness. Moreover, as used herein, the singular may be interpreted in the plural, and alternately, any term in the plural may be interpreted to be in the singular.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention is generally directed to customizable packaging that includes a removable layer. More specifically, the present invention is directed to packaging that may enclose or package a stored value card with a scratch-off removable layer for customization. Note that such packaging may be used for a physical gift card (where the gift card is present to conduct transactions) as well as digital gift cards, where the value may be digitally maintained either in an associated account, digital wallet, or otherwise stored. As discussed in greater detail below, the layer exposed by partial removal or scratching off of a coating may comprise various designs or patterns, including but not limited to designs or patterns directed to specific holidays or events.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>100</b> will now be discussed. System <b>100</b> may comprise a package comprising a box <b>110</b> and a lid <b>120</b>, as well as a stylus <b>130</b>. Box <b>110</b> and lid <b>120</b> may be of any size or shape and is not bound to the specific configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Stylus <b>130</b> may comprise plastic, wood, metal, and/or any other material that may be firm enough to remove an outer coating when the stylus is used to scratch.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A stylus may also take various forms, such as a pen, pencil, keychain, etc. It is also contemplated that rather than a stylus, a disc, button, or other item may be provided to scratch away the layer. Such items may be associated with the gift or may provide a side-gift for the user. For example, a gift corresponding to a graduation event may offer a scratcher that can be worn as a button labeled &#x201c;Proud Parent.&#x201d; Or a scratcher for a holiday card may include a bottom or item labeled something along the lines of &#x201c;Happy Holidays&#x201d; or &#x201c;Ho Ho Ho.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Box <b>110</b> and/or lid <b>120</b>, or any portion thereof, may comprise a pattern or color, covered by a removable layer. For example, the lid <b>120</b> may comprise a bright green color, covered by a removable, differently colored titanium oxide layer that may be scratched away by a user. In this manner, a user may scratch away portions of the titanium oxide layer, thereby exposing in such areas the bright green color beneath. A user may therefore personalize the packaging for the recipient, user, event, and/or any other factor or characteristic.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Note that other materials may be used for the removable layer in addition to titanium oxide. For example, removable layers may comprise a removable metallic foil, opaque latex material, paints, inks, foils, overlays, and/or any other material that may be adhered to a substrate of the box <b>110</b> or lid <b>120</b> and removed using a scraping or scratching motion. Various layers of paint or adhesives may be used, as well as additional items such as but not limited to glitter, confetti, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary cross section <b>200</b> of a substrate with a removable coating is illustrated. Specifically, substrate <b>210</b> is shown having a pattern or color <b>220</b> printed thereon (shown on top of the substrate <b>210</b>). The pattern or color <b>220</b> is then covered with a removable layer <b>230</b> (shown on top of the pattern or color <b>220</b>). Accordingly, when the removable layer <b>230</b> is removed in whole or in part, such removal may expose the pattern or color <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Looking to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an exemplary package <b>300</b> is shown. Packaging <b>300</b> may be used to merchandise and/or sell a stored value card or other financial product, such as but not limited to a gift card, digitally redeemable gift card, general purpose financial card (which may or may not be reloadable), coupon, chit, and/or any other item of value. Package <b>300</b> may comprise a substrate <b>310</b>, which item of value <b>320</b> may be attached to, adhered to, inserted within, encased by, or otherwise associated with the substrate <b>310</b>. In addition, a stylus <b>330</b> may be provided to enable a user to remove some or all of the removable layer. Stylus <b>330</b> may be attached to package <b>300</b> using element <b>331</b>. Element <b>331</b> may be any means sufficient to removably attach the stylus <b>330</b> to the package <b>300</b>, such as tape, adhesive, putty, rubber band, low-tack glue, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Package <b>300</b> may optionally comprise additional elements, such as but not limited to a removable section <b>340</b>, which may comprise means for hanging or merchandising the package <b>300</b> (such as, but not limited to the sombrero hole <b>341</b>), and information such as activation information shown at <b>350</b>. Note that removable section <b>340</b> may be separated from the rest of the package by a line of weakness or scoring <b>342</b>, which may permit a user to remove the pricing information from the packaging before offering the package <b>300</b> and item <b>320</b> to a recipient.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that the configuration and orientation of the package <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is exemplary only. In other words, it is contemplated by the present invention that the stylus <b>330</b> may, for example, be attached to the removable portion <b>340</b>, or may be packaged within the package itself (particularly if the item of value <b>310</b> comprises a removable coating for decorative purposes). In short, variations from the design and configuration illustrated are expected.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, a greeting card or birthday card is shown. Greeting card or birthday card may comprise a front surface <b>410</b>, an inside surface (typically printed on) <b>420</b>, and a back surface <b>430</b>, each shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref>, respectively. As with a typical greeting card or birthday card, the front surface <b>410</b> may comprise text or design <b>411</b>. Text or design <b>411</b> may be, for example, a greeting, well-wishes, introduction to a joke or whimsical saying, image of balloons or holiday items, etc. The inside surface <b>420</b> may be printed with colors and/or a design and may be covered in whole or in part with a removable layer <b>421</b>. A user may scratch away removable layer <b>421</b> to personalize the card with messages, drawings, etc., shown at <b>423</b>. In this manner, a generalized greeting card may be personalized using system, methods, and/or processes in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that the card may also include a value item <b>422</b>. Value item <b>422</b> may be a stored value card or other such physical item or may be an identifier that may be redeemed for digital value. In accordance with some embodiments, value item may be a code (such as but not limited to a bar code (traditional, QR code, etc.), an alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric code) that may be used to redeem a value or a digital item.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the back portion <b>430</b> of the card may comprise additional information, for example information <b>431</b> used to purchase the card and/or activate the value item. In accordance with some embodiments, for security purpose the value item <b>422</b> may be packaged within or sealed within the substrate of the card and the back portion <b>430</b> may include lines of weakness or scoring that may be used to remove the value item <b>422</b> from the card.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that in the discussion above the removable layer was only discussed on the inner portion <b>420</b>. However, it is contemplated that any portion&#x2014;or the entirety&#x2014;of the card may be covered with printed colors or designs, overlayed with a removable layer. In this manner, any portion of the card may be personalized by a user.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>, a value item <b>500</b> will now be discussed. Value item <b>500</b> may comprise a stored value card, gift card, toll-card, long-distance card, wireless top-up card, gift certificate, chit, credit card, prepaid credit card, general purpose financial services product, reloadable financial services product, coupon, and/or any item redeemable for something of value. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates a front surface <b>510</b> of a value item, which may comprise some identifying features (such as redemption network <b>512</b> (&#x201c;VISA&#x201d;) and/or amount <b>513</b> (&#x201c;$50&#x201d;). Note that it is contemplated that these items are optional are not required by all embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Front surface <b>510</b> of the value item <b>500</b> may also comprise an area coated with a removable layer <b>511</b>. In this manner, a user may scratch away portions of the removable layer <b>511</b> to personalize the value item <b>500</b>. As discussed above, under the removable layer <b>511</b> various colors, patterns, designs, images, etc. may be printed in one or more colors.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, a back surface <b>520</b> of the value item <b>500</b> may comprise information required to use or otherwise redeem the value item <b>500</b>. For example, back surface <b>520</b> may comprise an indicia <b>521</b> (which may be a machine readable indicia, such as a magnetic stripe or bar code), serial or personal account number <b>522</b> associated with the value item, expiration date <b>523</b>, area for a signature or identifying information <b>524</b>, and potentially a card verification value (CVV) or card verification code (CVC) <b>525</b>. Additional information, such as a contact number <b>526</b> may also be printed on the value item. However, again note that the additional information shown on the back surface <b>520</b> of value item <b>500</b> is exemplary, and it is contemplated that in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, various products may include all, some, or none of this information.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As discussed above, beneath a removable layer a substrate may be printed with various colors, patterns, designs, etc. Some or all of such colors, patterns, designs, etc. may be revealed when a user removes some or all of the removable layer. It is contemplated that colors, designs, patterns, etc. may be event-agnostic (that is, merely colored or using various patterns), or may be specifically directed to certain events. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>G</figref>, various patterns can be seen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate event-agnostic patterns, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>D-<b>6</b>F</figref> are directed to specific events. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> shows balloons, often associated with birthdays, graduations, and other celebratory events. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref> shows hearts, often associated with Valentine's day, dating, anniversaries, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref> illustrates snowflakes, often associated with winter holidays such as Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanza, etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is also contemplated that patterns may be more specific, but not directed to a specific event. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref> shows a pattern of sports-balls and/or equipment which may be used for various events (birthdays, Father's Day, Christmas, random gifts, etc.).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a greeting or birthday card <b>700</b> in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. Card <b>700</b> includes an inner surface <b>710</b> which may comprise a message <b>711</b> printed on the card <b>700</b>. However, portions or the entirety of the surface <b>710</b> may be coated with a removable layer, as discussed above. In this manner, a user may personalize the card <b>700</b> by writing personal messages or greetings, drawing various items, etc., such as shown at <b>713</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Card <b>700</b> may also comprise an indicia <b>712</b> that may be used by a recipient to access and/or redeem something. For example, indicia <b>712</b> may redeem a digital value item, or may provide access to an online video personalized by the user. It is contemplated that indicia <b>712</b> may be visible, or itself be covered by the removable layer. Covering the indicia by the removable layer (particularly if the indicia is redeemable for a value item) may increase the security of the item and potentially reduce fraud based on bad actors having access to the redeemable code.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is contemplated that indicia <b>712</b> may be activated or authorized by transactions&#x2014;for example, through a purchase transaction in the case of a value item, or by associated a file with the indicia in the case of a personalized video. Such activation or authorization may be associated with an additional indicia or indicium (such as discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) or through other means (for example, explained in packaging, sales material, etc.).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, removable layers may be used to both provide personalization from users as well as provide additional fun or excitement to recipients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> show a message or salutation at <b>811</b> (&#x201c;Happy Birthday!&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows an inside surface of a greeting card or birthday card when a portion of the removable layer has been removed. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows that a user has scratched away a portion of the removable layer at <b>813</b> to write a name &#x201c;John&#x201d; and draw a smiley face. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows a notation <b>812</b> that a gift for the recipient can be found under a portion of the removable layer <b>814</b>, surrounded by an indicator line <b>815</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, this portion <b>814</b> of the removable layer has been removed, showing for example a value of the gift at <b>816</b> (&#x201c;$50&#x201d;), and a code or other redemption information <b>817</b>. In this manner, even upon opening a personalized card, a recipient is still unaware of the gift, potentially building the excitement.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, such excitement can also be found by using the scratch-off layer to obscure or cover details of a value item or chit <b>900</b>. More specifically, value item <b>900</b> may comprise an identifier <b>910</b> of a redemption network, but the value <b>930</b> and/or indicia or instructions to access the value <b>940</b> may be covered by a removable layer <b>920</b>. Such removable layer <b>920</b> may be removed in whole or in part by a user for personalization of the gift, and may be provided to the recipient with portions of the removable layer <b>920</b> intact, for example continuing to obscure the gift amount <b>930</b> and indicia <b>940</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In accordance with some embodiments of the invention and as discussed above, the indicia may be a machine-readable indicia (bar code, QR code, magnetic stripe, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, etc.), or may comprise a alpha, numeric, and/or alphanumeric code that may be entered or otherwise provided subsequently to access or obtain the value.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">While various packaging shapes and sizes are contemplated by the present invention, specific examples are set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>E and <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> illustrate a box approximately four (4) inches wide by four (4) inches high, and approximately 0.875 inches deep. Note that these sizes and values are variable, and this detailed description of size is included as exemplary only and shall not be construed to be limiting. In general, the box may be made so that a bottom and a top fit together, with the top overlapping the bottom edges, as is typical with two-part boxes. The box and top may be constructed of any material, for example cardboard, pressboard, one-millimeter grey board, etc. The box and top may be lined with laminated paper, such as 0.0075&#x2033; coated one-side (C1S) matte paper. The top of the box may be printed with various shapes and colors, for example using four-color printing to achieve vibrant colors. Additional details regarding the box and lid are discussed below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>E and <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A top view of a box top <b>1010</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows the reverse of the top <b>1020</b> and illustrates that a stylus or other type of scraping device <b>1030</b> may be attached to the reverse of the top <b>1020</b>, for example using tape <b>1040</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> illustrates a bottom <b>1050</b>, together with top may be used to form a box in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, additional elements may be included, for example a tray as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>, which may be used to hold a value item and may include an area <b>1070</b> for a user to write or inscribe a value of the product. For merchandising purposes, a j-hook <b>1080</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>, may be attached to the box top or bottom, for example by using an adhesive area <b>1090</b>. It is contemplated that such packaging may be sold assembled or unassembled in a flat condition. As discussed in greater detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, one or more portions or surfaces of the box or top may be coated with a removable layer as discussed throughout this invention.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref> show a liner for a top surface of a box top <b>1110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, a reverse side of the liner <b>1120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, a first surface of a bottom liner <b>1130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, and a reverse side of the bottom liner <b>1140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref>. It can be seen that one side of the liners (<b>1110</b>, <b>1130</b>) may include a removable layer that may be personalized by a user. The bottom liner may also comprise additional information, such as user/recipient information at <b>1231</b> and/or information about the product <b>1232</b>, such as but not limited to a product number, universal price code (UPC) or stock-keeping unit (SKU), identification of manufacturer, etc. Note that other than the user/recipient information at <b>1231</b> and the information about the product <b>1232</b>, the rest of the liner may be coated with a removable layer that may be partially removed by a user to personalize the gift box.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, the scratch-off layer may be protected or shielded by a peel-off layer or sticker to prevent unwanted scratches or marks on the scratch-off layer. Such stickers may be adhered to the scratch-off layer via adhesive or static attraction. In some embodiments, an insert such as a cardboard panel may be used to protect the scratch-off layer until purchase and personalization. The ability to protect the scratch-off coating may also determine what surfaces of a gift component are coated with the scratch-off material. For example, sides of a gift box may be difficult to protect, and accordingly may not be coated with the scratch-off material.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is also contemplated by the present invention that the scratch off layer may be of any color or opacity. Designs, patterns, pictures etc. may be printed on top of the scratch off layer, as well as beneath the scratch-off layer. Such scratch off material may be utilized in any sort of gift card holder, including three-dimensional holders (boxes, jars, components, etc.).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Personalization of gift card holders and other devices (such as cards that indicate or provide information sufficient to obtain and/or redeem a digital value or digital gift card) may occur in additional manners. For example, in some embodiments rather than physically scratching off and irreversible altering an item or packaging, personalization may be removable, erasable, or otherwise modifiable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, through the use of resistive screens or panels, various personalization may occur. Resistive screens may comprise &#x201c;magic screen&#x201d; or &#x201c;magic slate&#x201d; material, where a flap of material is pressed against a backing using a finger or stylus, and a mark is made where the material is pressed against the backing. Such drawings or marks may be removed or erased by lifting the flap of material away from the backing, removing the marks for subsequent drawing or marking.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a simple embodiment, a transparent sheet (for example a sheet of acetate) may loosely rest atop a substrate. The substrate may be, for example, a wax or wax-like material. When the transparent sheet is pressed against the substrate, the color of the substrate may show through. Any markings or drawings may be erased by lifting the sheet away from the substrate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments of the invention, the transparent sheet may comprise polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or any material with similar characteristics or properties, and the substrate may comprise a wax-coated board, cardboard, paper, or substrate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some resistive screens may comprise at least in part a liquid crystal display (LCD) and utilize a power source such as a battery. Such devices may have layers of electrodes with liquid crystals disposed between. Such liquid crystals may generally be transparent, but if pressed&#x2014;for example by a finger or a stylus&#x2014;the liquid crystals may be aligned, thereby becoming reflective and indicating the marks. The battery may be utilized to provide a small amount of power to return the liquid crystals to their original, transparent, orientation.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other mechanisms for personalization may comprise magnetophoretic panels, which may utilize a liquid comprising dark magnetic particles that may be drawn to the panel surface using a magnetic stylus or device.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It will be understood that the specific embodiments of the present invention shown and described herein are exemplary only. Numerous variations, changes, substitutions and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that all subject matter described herein and shown in the accompanying drawings be regarded as illustrative only, and not in a limiting sense.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
