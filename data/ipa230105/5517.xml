id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An object is to shorten the time for rewriting data in memory cells. A memory module includes a first memory cell, a second memory cell, a selection transistor, and a wiring WBL<b>1</b>. The first memory cell includes a first memory node. The second memory cell includes a second memory node. One end of the first memory cell is electrically connected to the wiring WBL<b>1</b> through the selection transistor. The other end of the first memory cell is electrically connected to one end of the second memory cell. The other end of the second memory cell is electrically connected to the wiring WBL<b>1</b>. When the selection transistor is on, data in the first memory node is rewritten by a signal supplied through the selection transistor to the wiring WBL<b>1</b>. When the selection transistor is off, data in the first memory node is rewritten by a signal supplied through the second memory node to the wiring WBL<b>1. </b></p></abstract><drawings

The use of transistors exhibiting low off-state current as the transistors WTr can ensure independence of data stored in the adjacent memory nodes. Moreover, the transistor WTr may have a backgate. Application of voltage to the backgate enables control of the threshold voltage of the transistor WTr. A wiring BGL illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is electrically connected to the backgates of the transistors WTr in the memory cells MC[<b>1</b>] to MC[n].

When a transistor with low off-state current characteristics is used as the transistor WTr for controlling data retention, the memory cell MC can retain data for a long time. As a result, the number of refreshing retained data can be reduced, leading to lower power consumption of the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For a channel formation region of the transistor RTr, a material achieving high field-effect mobility of the transistor is preferably used. Using such a transistor allows the semiconductor device to operate faster.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the transistor RTr also has a backgate; application of voltage to the backgate enables control of the threshold voltage of the transistor RTr.

As a method for providing a transistor over a flexible substrate, there is a method in which the transistor is formed over a non-flexible substrate and then the transistor is separated and transferred to the flexible substrate.

When the substrate has a small thickness, the weight of the semiconductor device including the transistor can be reduced. When the substrate has a small thickness, even in the case of using glass or the like, the substrate may have elasticity or a property of returning to its original shape when bending or pulling is stopped. Thus, an impact applied to the semiconductor device over the substrate due to dropping or the like can be reduced.

For example, two or more kinds of source gases are sequentially supplied to the chamber by switching of corresponding switching valves (also referred to as high-speed valves) such that the source gases are not mixed. For example, a first source gas is introduced, an inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen) or the like is introduced at the same time as or after the introduction of the first source gas, and then a second source gas is introduced. Note that in the case where the first source gas and the inert gas are introduced at a time, the inert gas serves as a carrier gas, and the inert gas may also be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the second source gas. Alternatively, the first source gas may be exhausted by vacuum evacuation instead of the introduction of the inert gas, and then the second source gas may be introduced. The first source gas is adsorbed on a surface of a substrate to form a first thin layer, and then the second source gas is introduced to react with the first thin layer; thus, a second thin layer is stacked over the first thin layer, and a thin film is formed as a result. The sequence of the gas introduction is controlled and repeated a plurality of times until a desired thickness is obtained, whereby a thin film with excellent step coverage can be formed. The thickness of the thin film can be adjusted by the number of repetition times of the sequence of the gas introduction; therefore, an ALD method makes it possible to adjust a thickness accurately and thus is suitable for manufacturing a minute FET.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">A variety of films such as the metal film, the semiconductor film, and the inorganic insulating film disclosed in this embodiment and the foregoing embodiment can be formed by a thermal CVD method such as a MOCVD method or an ALD method.

However, the shape is not always a regular hexagon and is a non-regular hexagon in some cases. A pentagonal lattice arrangement, a heptagonal lattice arrangement, and the like are sometimes included in the distortion. Note that a clear grain boundary cannot be observed even in the vicinity of distortion in the CAAC-OS. That is, formation of a grain boundary is inhibited by the distortion of a lattice arrangement. This is probably because the CAAC-OS can tolerate distortion owing to a low-density arrangement of oxygen atoms in the a-b plane direction, an interatomic bond distance changed by substitution of a metal element, and the like.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">The CAAC-OS is a metal oxide with high crystallinity. In the CAAC-OS, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is less likely to occur because a clear grain boundary cannot be observed. Entry of impurities, formation of defects, or the like might decrease the crystallinity of a metal oxide. This means that the CAAC-OS is a metal oxide having small amounts of impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies). Thus, a metal oxide including the CAAC-OS is physically stable. Therefore, the metal oxide including the CAAC-OS is resistant to heat and has high reliability.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Note that the region B includes an atomic ratio [In]:[M]:[Zn] of 4:2:3 to 4:2:4.1 and in the neighborhood thereof.

Even with the same atomic ratio, the properties of a metal oxide might differ depending on a formation condition. For example, when the metal oxide is formed with a sputtering apparatus, a film having an atomic ratio deviated from the atomic ratio of a target is formed. In particular, [Zn] in the film might be smaller than [Zn] in the target depending on the substrate temperature in deposition.

This is because the source and the drain of a transistor are interchangeable depending on the structure, operation conditions, or the like of the transistor. Note that the source or the drain of the transistor can also be referred to as a source (or drain) terminal, a source (or drain) electrode, or the like as appropriate depending on the situation. In this specification and the like, two terminals except a gate are sometimes referred to as a first terminal and a second terminal or as a third terminal and a fourth terminal. In this specification and the like, a channel formation region refers to a region where a channel is formed by application of a potential to the gate, and the formation of this region enables current to flow between the source and the drain.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0291">Functions of a source and a drain are sometimes switched when a transistor of different polarity is employed or when a direction of current flow is changed in circuit operation, for example.

For example, an &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; is used as part of a &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; in some cases, and vice versa. Moreover, the term &#x201c;electrode&#x201d; or &#x201c;wiring&#x201d; can also mean a combination of a plurality of electrodes or wirings formed in an integrated manner.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0294">In this specification and the like, &#x201c;voltage&#x201d; and &#x201c;potential&#x201d; can be replaced with each other. The term &#x201c;voltage&#x201d; refers to a potential difference from a reference potential. When the reference potential is a ground potential, for example, &#x201c;voltage&#x201d; can be replaced with &#x201c;potential.&#x201d; A ground potential does not necessarily mean 0 V. Potentials are relative values, and a potential supplied to a wiring or the like is sometimes changed depending on the reference potential.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0295">In this specification and the like, the terms &#x201c;film&#x201d; and &#x201c;layer&#x201d; can be interchanged with each other depending on the case or circumstances.

For example, in some cases, the term &#x201c;conductor&#x201d; can be used instead of &#x201c;conductive layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;conductive film,&#x201d; and the term &#x201c;insulator&#x201d; can be used instead of &#x201c;insulating layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;insulating film.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0299" num="0296">In this specification and the like, the terms &#x201c;wiring,&#x201d; &#x201c;signal line,&#x201d; &#x201c;power supply line,&#x201d; and the like can be replaced with each other depending on the case or circumstances. For example, in some cases, the term &#x201c;signal line&#x201d; or &#x201c;power supply line&#x201d; can be used instead of &#x201c;wiring,&#x201d; and vice versa. In some cases, the term &#x201c;signal line&#x201d; can be used instead of &#x201c;power supply line,&#x201d; and vice versa.

Alternatively, a switch has a function of selecting and changing a current path.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0300">For example, an electrical switch or a mechanical switch can be used. That is, a switch is not limited to a certain element and can be any element capable of controlling current.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0301">Examples of an electrical switch include a transistor (e.g., a bipolar transistor and a MOS transistor), a diode (e.g., a PN diode, a PIN diode, a Schottky diode, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode, a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diode, and a diode-connected transistor), and a logic circuit in which such elements are combined.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0302">In the case of using a transistor as a switch, the on state of the transistor refers to a state in which a source electrode and a drain electrode of the transistor are regarded as being electrically short-circuited. The off state of the transistor refers to a state in which the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor are regarded as being electrically disconnected. In the case where a transistor operates just as a switch, there is no particular limitation on the polarity (conductivity type) of the transistor.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0303">An example of a mechanical switch is a switch using a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, such as a digital micromirror device (DMD). Such a switch includes an electrode that can be moved mechanically, and its conduction and non-conduction is controlled with movement of the electrode.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Connection&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0307" num="0304">In this specification and the like, the description &#x201c;X and Y are connected&#x201d; means that X and Y are electrically connected, X and Y are functionally connected, and X and Y are directly connected. Accordingly, without being limited to a predetermined connection relation (e.g., a connection relation shown in drawings and texts), another connection relation is regarded as being included in the drawings and the texts.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0305">Here, X and Y each denote an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, or a layer).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0306">For example, in the case where X and Y are electrically connected, at least element that enables electrical connection between X and Y (e.g., a switch, a transistor, a capacitor, an inductor, a resistor, a diode, a display element, a light-emitting element, or a load) can be connected between X and Y. Note that a switch is controlled to be turned on or off That is, a switch is conducting or not conducting (is turned on or off) to determine whether current flows therethrough or not.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0307">For example, in the case where X and Y are functionally connected, at least one circuit that enables functional connection between X and Y (e.g., a logic circuit such as an inverter, a NAND circuit, or a NOR circuit; a signal converter circuit such as a DA converter circuit, an AD converter circuit, or a gamma correction circuit; a potential level converter circuit such as a power supply circuit (e.g., a step-up circuit or a step-down circuit) or a level shifter circuit for changing the potential level of a signal; a voltage source; a current source; a switching circuit; an amplifier circuit such as a circuit capable of increasing signal amplitude, the amount of current, or the like, an operational amplifier, a differential amplifier circuit, a source follower circuit, or a buffer circuit; a signal generator circuit; a memory circuit; and/or a control circuit) can be connected between X and Y. For instance, even if another circuit is provided between X and Y, X and Y are regarded as being functionally connected when a signal output from X is transmitted to Y.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0308">Note that an explicit description &#x201c;X and Y are electrically connected&#x201d; means that X and Y are electrically connected (i.e., X and Y are connected with another element or circuit provided therebetween), X and Y are functionally connected (i.e., X and Y are functionally connected with another circuit provided therebetween), and X and Y are directly connected (i.e., X and Y are connected without another element or circuit provided therebetween). That is, the term &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; is substantially the same as the term &#x201c;connected.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0312" num="0309">For example, any of the following expressions can be used for the case where a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X through (or not through) Z1 and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y through (or not through) Z2, or the case where a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is directly connected to one part of Z1 and another part of Z1 is directly connected to X while a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is directly connected to one part of Z2 and another part of Z2 is directly connected to Y.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0310">Examples of the expressions include &#x201c;X, Y, and a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor are electrically connected to each other, and X, the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are electrically connected in this order,&#x201d; &#x201c;a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X, a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y, and X, the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are electrically connected in this order,&#x201d; and &#x201c;X is electrically connected to Y through a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor, and X, the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are provided to be connected in this order.&#x201d; When the connection order in a circuit configuration is defined by an expression similar to the above examples, a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor can be distinguished from each other to specify the technical scope. Note that the above expressions are examples, and there is no limitation on the expressions. Here, X, Y, Z1, and Z2 each denote an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, or a layer).</p><p id="p-0314" num="0311">Even when a circuit diagram shows that independent components are electrically connected to each other, one component sometimes has functions of a plurality of components. For example, when part of a wiring also functions as an electrode, one conductive film functions as the wiring and the electrode. Thus, the term &#x201c;electrical connection&#x201d; in this specification also means such a case where one conductive film has functions of a plurality of components.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Parallel and Perpendicular&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0315" num="0312">In this specification, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines ranges from &#x2212;10&#xb0; to 10&#xb0;, and accordingly also includes the case where the angle ranges from &#x2212;5&#xb0; to 5&#xb0;. The term &#x201c;substantially parallel&#x201d; indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines ranges from &#x2212;30&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;.
