Protectors for wire harness of various shapes and various materials are used in accordance with applications or the like.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, foamed sheaths made of foamed sheets have received attention. The foamed sheaths have an advantage that they are lightweight and can be produced by cutting a single foamed sheet into a desired shape.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The foamed sheaths are used in various manners, and can be used not only alone, but also in combination with another part. In particular, when the foamed sheath is used in combination with various parts made of different materials, the parts are joined and fixed to each other.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Resin materials can be joined to each other by a method including providing a mating mechanism to the resin materials and mating the resin materials to each other. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a method of joining two members to each other, according to which one member is provided with a boss having a protruding end while the other is provided with a hole through which the boss is insertable, and the two members are joined to each other by inserting the boss into the hole. This method of providing a mating mechanism to resin materials is applicable also to a case where a part made of a non-foamed material is to be attached to the foamed sheath described above.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Registered Utility Model No. 3068533</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, as mentioned above, the structure for fixing resin parts disclosed in Patent Document 1 requires processing to form one member and the other member in advance, and also gives rise to the problem that the joining portion between the two members is large in size. To join two members having different physical properties, it is conceivable to use an adhesive or a double-sided tape. However, depending on the structures and materials of the members, a resultant joining strength may be insufficient to allow the joining portion to be unjoined.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above circumstance, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a joining structure, a joining method, a wire harness sheath, and a wire harness that are capable of firmly joining members having different physical properties to each other, while making the joining portion thinner.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present inventors have conducted studies to achieve the above-described object. As a result of the studies, the present inventors have made the findings that a joining structure with which two different members (first and second members) having different physical properties are firmly joined to each other can be attained by employing the first member constituted by a first resin and the second member constituted by a second resin having, as a physical property, a higher foaming ratio than the first resin, and by forming, in the joining structure, a recessed joining portion that extends from an outer surface of the second member and reaches at least an interior of the first member in a state in which the first member and second member are overlapped on each other. Furthermore, the present inventors have made the findings that the above-described joining structure can be easily produced by a production method including: overlapping a first member constituted by a first resin and a second member constituted by a second resin on each other, the second resin having, as a physical property, a higher foaming ratio than the first resin; and joining the first member and the second member to each other by forming a recessed joining portion, the recessed joining portion being formed by pressing and hot-melting the second member such that a resultant molten portion extends from an outer surface of the second member and reaches at least an interior of the first member. Based on the foregoing findings, the present inventors have achieved the present invention.

Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the joining surface <b>5</b> preferably has a hot-molten portion <b>6</b> that spreads outward in a ring shape from the recessed joining portion <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">The presence of the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> described above means that in a state where the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b> are joined to each other, the second resin constituting the second member <b>2</b> and the first resin constituting the first member <b>1</b> are molten and flow at the joining interface position <b>4</b> between the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b>. The hot-molten portion <b>6</b> thus formed makes the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b> have a higher joining strength.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The hot-molten portion <b>6</b> may have any size, but usually, as the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> increases in size, the joining strength between the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b> is enhanced. For this reason, for example, the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> has a ring width dimension of preferably 0.5 mm or larger, more preferably 1.0 mm or larger, and further more preferably 1.5 mm or larger. In particular, making the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> have a ring width dimension of 1.5 mm or larger allows the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b> to be joined with a higher joining strength. On the other hand, the ring width dimension of the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> may be 0.5 mm or less.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">As will be described later, the recessed joining portion <b>3</b> is not limited to one having the shape of a perfect circle in plan view. Likewise, the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> is not limited to one having the shape of a perfect circular ring in plan view. If the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> does not have a perfect circular ring shape in plan view, the ring width dimension of the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> can be calculated in the following manner. The area enclosed by the outer contour line of the hot-molten portion <b>6</b> is measured, the diameter of a perfect circle that has the same area as the measured area is then calculated, and a difference between the diameter of the perfect circle and the diameter of the recessed joining portion <b>3</b> is determined as the ring width dimension of the hot-molten portion <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">The joining structure <b>10</b> described above can be used for various plastic parts and products. For example, it can be used for automobiles, motorcycles, bicycles, daily necessities, electrical appliances, personal computers, cameras, toys, various sheaths, and various containers. In particular, the joining structure <b>10</b> can be used for wire harness sheaths for automobiles, for example. Specifically, such a sheathed wire harness includes a wire harness and a wire harness sheath including the joining structure <b>10</b> described above. Here, examples of the wire harness sheath include a sheath that externally surrounds the entirety or a part of a wire harness, a sheath that is provided along a part of the outer periphery of a wire harness to protect the wire harness, and a sheath that regulates a direction in which a wire harness extends.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">2 Method of Producing Joining Structure</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In the following, the joining structure of the present embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref> are schematic diagrams for explaining a method of producing the joining structure of the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">The method of producing the joining structure of the present embodiment includes: a step of overlapping a first member <b>1</b>A constituted by a first resin and a second member <b>2</b>A constituted by a second resin on each other, the second resin having, as a physical property thereof, a higher foaming ratio than the first resin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>); a step of joining the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b> to each other by forming a recessed joining portion <b>3</b>, which is formed by pressing and hot-melting the second member <b>2</b>A such that the resultant molten portion extends from an outer surface of the second member <b>2</b>A and reaches at least an interior of the first member <b>1</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The method of pressing and hot-melting is not particularly limited as long as the first member <b>1</b>A and the second member <b>2</b>A are pressed while being molten by application of heat. For example, pressing and hot-melting of the second member <b>2</b>A may be performed under an applied pressure by using a soldering iron or a hot plate. Preferably, the pressing and hot-melting of the second member <b>2</b>A is performed using ultrasonic vibration and an applied pressure according to an ultrasonic welding method. Specifically, the ultrasonic welding method is preferably performed by using a welding horn H having a projection at its tip such that the projection is thrusted against the outer surface of the second member <b>2</b>A.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In this way, the second member <b>2</b>A, which is constituted by a second resin having, as a physical property, a higher foaming ratio than the first member <b>1</b>A, is subjected to the pressing and hot-melting so that the resultant molten portion extends from the outer surface of the second member <b>2</b>A and reaches at least the interior of the first member <b>1</b>A, thereby forming the recessed joining portion <b>3</b>. As a result, the second resin constituting the second member <b>2</b>A and the first resin constituting the first member <b>1</b>A are molten and flows in a direction of the joining interface between the first and second members. At this time, it is preferable that the welding horn H is thrusted to cross the joining interface position <b>4</b> to reach the first member <b>1</b>A, whereby at least first resin constituting the first member <b>1</b>A flows to the joining interface position <b>4</b> between the first member <b>1</b> and the second member <b>2</b>, while mixing with the second resin constituting the second member <b>2</b>A. This flow of the first and second resins allows strong joining to be achieved at this stage.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Employing the method of producing the joining structure <b>10</b> as described above makes it possible to obtain the joining structure <b>10</b> firmly joining the first member lA and the second member <b>2</b>A to each other, without having to form a mating structure having a complicated shape or to use an adhesive or a double-sided tape. Moreover, since the joining structure <b>10</b> eliminates the need for forming a complicated structure such as a mating structure for joining, the joining portion can be made thinner.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Note that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and modifications can be made freely without deviating from the spirit of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0050">A plate-shaped member (with a thickness of 1.5 mm) constituted by a non-foamed polypropylene resin (with a density of 0.91 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) was provided as a first member.
