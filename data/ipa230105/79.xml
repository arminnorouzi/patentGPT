enhancing the production of secondary metabolites in <i>Cannabis </i>and hemp. In particular, the present technology is related to compositions and methods for enhancing the essential oil content in <i>Cannabis </i>and hemp plants.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><i>Cannabis </i>is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae. The plant is also known as hemp, although this term is commonly used to refer to varieties of <i>Cannabis </i>cultivated for non-drug use. <i>Cannabis </i>is a complex plant with over 400 chemical entities of which more than 60 of them are cannabinoid compounds, some of them with opposing effects. The two most researched compounds in <i>Cannabis </i>plant are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Traditional cultivation methods for <i>Cannabis </i>plants are based on large-scale automatically controlled cultivation management facility using soil with automatic watering arrangement, or hydroponic or aeroponic systems like cultivation channels. A soil pH between 5.8 and 6.5 is generally used, although it can be adjusted beyond these values. Nutrients are taken up from the soil by roots and can be exogenously added in the form of fertilizers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional cultivation conditions and fertilizers used for <i>Cannabis </i>are unable to provide a consistent condition such that the cannabinoid and essential oil components of the <i>Cannabis </i>are reproducibly expressed from the same strain of <i>Cannabis</i>. Additionally, improper growing conditions cause various forms of stress, such as nutrient stress, temperature stress, light stress and water stress, which can stunt or halt plant growth, damage the plant, or in the worst case cause them to die. Thus, there is an unmet need to provide compositions and methods for cultivating <i>Cannabis </i>under conditions and using nutrient compositions to ensure increased productivity and quality of <i>Cannabis</i>, which reproducibly express and produce the desired components, while at the same time reduce or alleviate stress. The present technology addresses such unmet need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, provided is a composition for application to a <i>Cannabis </i>plant, which includes an antioxidant compound and a fertilizer.

It was observed that exogenous additives, e.g., sulfates such as K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>negatively affects cannabinoid and aroma compound production at the concentrations applied relative to a control group. Conversely, plants with exogenous additives, e.g., sulfates such as K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, in combination with an antioxidant such as melatonin applied resulted in the highest cannabinoid and aroma compound production with the smallest standard deviation. These results reveal that although excess exogenous K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>may negatively affect essential oil production, addition of an antioxidant, e.g., melatonin can counter these effects. The additives can be added applied as a foliar spray, added to the soil or applied hydroponically. The application of a composition including exogenous additives can significantly improve cannabinoid production as well as drastically influence the total content of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant's essential oil. Additionally, that salt-stress can be alleviated by application of a composition including exogenous additives, resulting in unprecedented consistency in cannabinoid and/or volatile aroma compound production. Further, exogenous addition of endogenous antioxidants such a melatonin can enhance secondary metabolite production to increase the content of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant essential oil.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present technology, thus generally described, will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1: Nutrient Solution Preparation</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Fertilizer grade K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>was dissolved as a raw powder into distilled water with a concentration of 700 &#x3bc;M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

These results suggest that K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>has negative or negligibly positive effects. On the other hand, G1-M, which had both K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and melatonin additives applied simultaneously, had the highest concentrations of both THC and total cannabinoids. This data suggests that melatonin can alleviate the detrimental effects of excess K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. More importantly, the standard deviation of G1-M is significantly smaller than other groups, suggesting that not only does melatonin enhance cannabinoid production relative to K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but also ensures consistent production across multiple samples. About &#x2dc;15% increase was observed in average cannabinoid production in the melatonin-spiked samples relative to the control. More importantly, melatonin exposed plants exhibit extremely small deviations in cannabinoid production. In all groups except G1-M a wide range of possible cannabinoid content is seen. G1 and the control groups are particularly spread in their content. The control group's lowest total cannabinoid content was &#x2dc;23.5%, while G1 was &#x2dc;22%. On the other hand, the lowest cannabinoid content for G1-M was &#x2dc;29%. This data suggests that melatonin effectively allows the <i>Cannabis </i>plant to achieve optimal cannabinoid production even while under salt-stress.

greater increases in volatile aroma compound production than cannabinoids were observed for G1-M relative to both G1 and the control. Three different samples of the plants shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> were measured to obtain an average. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the data for each plant ranked from highest to lowest. The aroma compounds include all terpenes and other compounds which impart aroma to composition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When aggregated into respective groups, significant increases for groups G1-M for aroma content were observe relative to the control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Further, very small deviations for G1-M were observed at the highest measured concentrations&#x2014;again indicating that melatonin effectively allows plants to perform at their optimal conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the increases in aroma content in group G1-M relative to G1 and the control groups. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the increases in a few individual components (top ten) of the aroma compound in group G1-M relative to G1 and the control groups. Three different samples of the plants shown were measured to for each group.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The results indicate that exogenous additives can drastically influence the total content of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant's essential oil. The present technology demonstrates that using a common base nutrient can have drastically improved cannabinoid production by addition of certain additives. Additionally, it shows that salt-stress can be alleviated by addition of melatonin, resulting in unprecedented consistency in cannabinoid and volatile aroma compound production. Addition of exogenous melatonin increased cannabinoid production relative to the control group at an incredibly consistent rate, thereby showing that this antioxidant can readily enhance secondary metabolite production to allow <i>Cannabis </i>plants to operate at their optimal efficiency&#x2014;regardless if salt stressed or not. Taken together, these data suggest that exogenous addition of endogenous antioxidants such a melatonin can enhance secondary metabolite production to increase the content of the <i>Cannabis </i>plant essential oil. It follows that addition of other naturally or non-naturally occurring antioxidants can effectively increase secondary metabolism in <i>Cannabis</i>. The methods can be used to increase the production of other desired compounds, e.g., sulfur compounds in <i>Cannabis </i>and other plants.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">While certain embodiments have been illustrated and described, it should be understood that changes and modifications can be made therein in accordance with ordinary skill in the art without departing from the technology in its broader aspects as defined in the following claims.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The embodiments, illustratively described herein may suitably be practiced in the absence of any element or elements, limitation or limitations, not specifically disclosed herein.
