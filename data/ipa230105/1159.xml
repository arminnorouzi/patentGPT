No. 63/218,107, entitled &#x201c;Instrument Advancement Device Configured for Septum Engagement&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter adapter, the catheter extending distally from the catheter adapter, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increases. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to vascular access devices and related systems and methods. In particular, in some embodiments, the present disclosure relates to an instrument advancement device that engages a septum to facilitate sealing and separation from a fluid pathway. In some embodiments, the fluid pathway may be in fluid communication with a proximal portion of the housing until the advancement element is moved to an advanced position, which may result in the septum sealing off the fluid pathway from the proximal portion of the housing. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may also reduce buckling of an instrument of the instrument advancement device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may be configured to advance the instrument into a catheter assembly and/or through the catheter assembly into vasculature of a patient. In some embodiments, the instrument may be advanced through a catheter of the catheter assembly to push past any occlusions in the catheter or the vasculature (e.g., thrombus or fibrin sheath at a tip of the catheter, vein collapse, or valves) to create a clear pathway for fluid flow. In some embodiments, the instrument may reduce or remove occlusions, improving patency of the catheter for medication and fluid delivery, as well as blood acquisition, during a dwell time of the catheter. In some embodiments, the catheter that may be inserted into vasculature of the patient prior to advancing the instrument in the catheter assembly and may remain in the vasculature when the instrument is advanced via the instrument advancement device. In some embodiments, the catheter may include a peripherally-inserted central catheter, a midline catheter, or a peripheral intravenous catheter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a housing, which may include a proximal end, a distal end, and a slot disposed between the proximal end of the housing and the distal end of the housing. In some embodiments, the housing may include a lumen disposed between the proximal end of the housing and a distal end of the housing. In some embodiments, the housing may include a septum pocket disposed within the housing and configured to receive a septum.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include an advancement element extending through the slot and configured to move linearly along the slot between a retracted position and an advanced position. In some embodiments, the retracted position may correspond to an initial position and/or a position to which the advancement element may return after moving to the advanced position. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include an instrument comprising a first end and a second end. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position to the advanced position, the second end of the instrument may be advanced beyond the distal end of the housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include the septum, which may be coupled to the instrument. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position and the advanced position, the septum may be configured to insert into the septum pocket to seal a portion of the lumen proximal to the septum.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the distal end of the housing may include a connector configured to couple to the catheter assembly. In some embodiments, the instrument may include a guidewire. In some embodiments, the instrument delivery device may include an extension tube, which may extend from the distal end of the housing and may be distal to the septum pocket. In some embodiments, the septum may include an annular taper. In some embodiments, the septum pocket may include another annular taper. In some embodiments, a cross-section of the septum is an oval or circular shape. In some embodiments, a cross-section of the septum is a rectangular or square shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the septum pocket may be disposed within the housing and configured to receive a split septum. In some embodiments, the split septum may be proximal to the septum pocket and spaced apart from the septum pocket. In some embodiments, in response to movement of the advancement element linearly along the slot, the split septum may be configured to insert into the septum pocket and the two sides of the split septum may be configured to press together to seal a portion of the lumen proximal to the septum.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a spring, which may be disposed within the housing and/or proximate a proximal end of the split septum. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position, the spring may be configured to compress the septum before the septum is inserted into the septum pocket.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the septum may be secured within the housing, and a proximal end of the septum may include a tapered pocket. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a funnel-shaped element, which may include a distal column coupled to a proximal cone-shape. In some embodiments, the instrument may extend through the funnel-shaped element. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position to the advanced position, the distal column may be configured to extend through the septum and the proximal cone-shape is disposed within the tapered pocket of the septum.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the housing may include a support wall, which may include an opening configured to receive a guidewire therethrough. In some embodiments, the distal face of the septum may be in contact with the support wall. In some embodiments, the guidewire may include a first end and a second end. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position to the advanced position, the second end of the guidewire may be advanced beyond the distal end of the housing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, an outer diameter of the guidewire may increase in a proximal direction such that the guidewire compresses the septum a greater amount when the advancement element is in the retracted position than when the advancement element is in the advanced position. In some embodiments, a proximal face of the septum may include a lubricant. In some embodiments, when the advancement element is in the retracted position, the guidewire may extend through the septum and the outer diameter of the guidewire may be spaced apart from the septum.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a first advancement element extending through the slot and configured to move linearly along the slot between a first retracted position and a first advanced position. In some embodiments, the instrument advancement device may include a second advancement element extending through the slot and configured to move linearly along the slot between a second retracted position and a second advanced position. In some embodiments, the second advancement element may be proximal to the first advancement element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, a tube may be coupled to the first advancement element. In some embodiments, when the first advancement element is in the first advanced position, the tube may extend through the septum. In some embodiments, the guidewire may be coupled to or extend through the second advancement element and the tube. In some embodiments, the guidewire may include a first end and a second end, and when the second advancement element is moved linearly along the slot from the retracted position to the advanced position, the second end of the guidewire may be advanced beyond the distal end of the housing. In some embodiments, in response to the first advancement element being in the first retracted position, a distal end of the tube may be proximal to the septum. In some embodiments, the second advancement element may be disposed in the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are examples and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to the arrangements and instrumentality illustrated in the drawings.
