As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the rotor <b>2</b> has a substantially cylindrical rotor body <b>10</b> extending along an axis O, a disk <b>20</b> provided to surround an outer periphery of the rotor body <b>10</b>, and a plurality of rotor blades <b>30</b> arranged in a circumferential direction along an outer peripheral surface of the disk <b>20</b>. On the outer peripheral surface of the rotor body <b>10</b>, a plurality of rotor blades <b>30</b> are provided along the circumferential direction of the rotor <b>2</b> via the disk <b>20</b>. The plurality of rotor blades <b>30</b> form a blade row <b>3</b> for one stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a plurality of blade grooves <b>40</b> arranged at intervals along the circumferential direction of the disk <b>20</b> are formed on the outer peripheral surface of the disk <b>20</b>.

The measuring device <b>110</b> is formed of, for example, frame members <b>106</b><i>a </i>to <b>106</b><i>d </i>on four sides and has a rectangular shape with an open center portion. On two orthogonal sides of the four sides, an actuator <b>101</b> and an actuator <b>102</b> are provided with sliders which are movable in each side direction. For example, the actuator <b>101</b> is provided in parallel with a frame member <b>106</b><i>a </i>forming one side in a Y-axis direction, and the actuator <b>102</b> is fixedly provided on a frame member <b>106</b><i>b </i>forming one side in an X-axis direction. The actuator <b>101</b> is fixed to the slider of the actuator <b>102</b>, and by moving this slider, the actuator <b>101</b> can move in the X-axis direction.

The camera <b>103</b>, the hardness meter <b>104</b>, and the laser range finder <b>105</b> are installed to face a depth direction of the paper surface. The camera <b>103</b> captures an image of the blade groove <b>40</b>. The hardness meter <b>104</b> measures the hardness of the blade groove <b>40</b>. The hardness meter <b>104</b> is an ultrasonic type or image measurement type hardness meter. The hardness meter <b>104</b> includes an actuator <b>104</b><i>a </i>(for example, an air cylinder), and is configured to press a tip portion of the hardness meter <b>104</b> against the blade groove <b>40</b> by driving the actuator <b>104</b><i>a. </i>The laser range finder <b>105</b> measures the distance to the disk <b>20</b>. For example, the header <b>108</b> is moved to each vertex of the region &#x3b1;, and the distance from the laser range finder <b>105</b> to the disk <b>20</b> is measured at each vertex. Thereby, the tilt of a plane (XY stage) formed by the movement of the header <b>108</b> and by the disk <b>20</b> to which the measuring device <b>110</b> is attached can be computed.

When the header <b>108</b> moves, the sensor control unit <b>123</b> causes the camera <b>103</b> to capture an indentation formed by hitting the hardness meter <b>104</b>. The data acquisition unit <b>124</b> records the indentation image captured by the camera <b>103</b> in the storage unit <b>125</b> in association with the identification information of the first measurement point. When the measurement for the first measurement point is completed, the storage unit <b>125</b> stores the coordinate position of the first measurement point in the blade groove coordinate system, the measured value of the hardness data, and the indentation image. The indentation image is acquired as evidence that the hardness was measured at the correct position. After acquiring the indentation image, it is possible to verify whether or not the hardness can be measured at a position that is not separated from the target measurement point by analyzing the indentation image later.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the measurement of the first measurement point is completed, the worker instructs the control device <b>120</b> to perform the second measurement. The processing control unit <b>121</b> instructs the movement control unit <b>122</b> to move the header <b>108</b> (the center of the camera <b>103</b>) to the second measurement target point based on the coordinate position of the second measurement target point in the blade groove coordinate system and on the relative positional relationship between the XY stage coordinate system and the blade groove coordinate system computed earlier. The movement control unit <b>122</b> moves the camera <b>103</b> to a position where the center of the camera <b>103</b> is aligned with the second measurement target point according to this instruction. After that, the hardness at the second measurement point is measured by the same procedure as that at the first measurement point. In other words, the worker confirms the image obtained by capturing the second measurement target point, and when there is no problem, the worker gives an instruction for the measurement. Then, the movement control unit <b>122</b> moves the hardness meter <b>104</b> to the position of the camera <b>103</b>, and the sensor control unit <b>123</b> measures the hardness at the second measurement point using the hardness meter <b>104</b>. The movement control unit <b>122</b> moves the camera <b>103</b> to the position of the second measurement target point again, and the sensor control unit <b>123</b> causes the camera <b>103</b> to capture an indentation image. The data acquisition unit <b>124</b> acquires the hardness measurement result and the indentation image and records the acquired measurement result and the indentation image in the storage unit <b>125</b>. The storage unit <b>125</b> records the coordinate position of the second measurement point, the measured hardness data, and the indentation image. The same applies to the third and subsequent measurement points. The processing control unit <b>121</b> gives instructions to the movement control unit <b>122</b> and to the sensor control unit <b>123</b> until the hardness measurement at the final measurement point is completed, and sequentially executes movement to each measurement point, hardness measurement, and indentation image capturing.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the hardness measurement and the indentation image capturing are completed at all the measurement target points, the processing control unit <b>121</b> completes the hardness measurement process for the current blade groove <b>40</b>. The image processing unit <b>127</b> may, for example, combine an indentation image with the entire image to generate an entire image of the blade groove <b>40</b> after the measurement process is completed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an example of the entire image after the hardness measurement process is completed. For example, the mark in a frame <b>91</b> is an indentation generated by the actual hardness measurement. The image processing unit <b>127</b> may generate an image in which a mark indicating a measurement target point defined by CAD data is further superimposed on the actual indentation. In this case, as the distance from the center of the image increases due to the aberration of the camera, the indentation and the mark indicating the measurement point tend to be separated, but in order to prevent this, the image processing unit <b>127</b> may correct the aberration of the generated image.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">When continuously measuring the other blade grooves <b>40</b>, the worker moves the measuring device <b>110</b> to the next blade groove <b>40</b> to be measured, and executes the process after step S<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, according to the present embodiment, by inserting and attaching the measuring device <b>110</b> between the blade rows <b>3</b> and the blade row <b>3</b>, the hardness of the blade groove <b>40</b> can be measured without removing the blade rows <b>3</b> from the rotor <b>2</b> of the steam turbine <b>1</b>. In the hardness measurement of the blade groove <b>40</b>, it is necessary to measure the hardness of one blade groove <b>40</b> at several tens of measurement points. According to the measuring system <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, the hardness can be measured with high accuracy at several tens of measurement points semi-automatically by simply attaching the measuring device <b>110</b> according to the position of the blade groove <b>40</b> to be measured. For example, the worker can see the superimposed image in which the measurement target point is displayed in the blade groove <b>40</b> before the hardness measurement, and can confirm whether or not the position of the measurement point is appropriate as a whole (step S<b>8</b>). When the position of the measurement point is not appropriate, the worker can set the measurement target point at the correct position on the superimposed image (step S<b>9</b>). The worker can make a final confirmation as to whether or not the current measurement target point is appropriate at the time of positioning immediately before the actual measurement (step S<b>10</b>). Accordingly, highly accurate hardness measurement is possible. Other than this confirmation work, the hardness measurement work can be automated, and hardness measurement can be performed at high speed even in places where manual work is difficult. In other words, within a limited inspection time, the tip of the hardness meter can be accurately positioned at the point to be measured in the blade groove, and the hardness distribution data can be acquired.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a view showing an example of a hardware configuration of a control device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A computer <b>900</b> includes a CPU <b>901</b>, a main storage device <b>902</b>, an auxiliary storage device <b>903</b>, an input/output interface <b>904</b>, and a communication interface <b>905</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The control device <b>120</b> described above is mounted on the computer <b>900</b>.
