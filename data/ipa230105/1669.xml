num="0002">Broadly, the present disclosure is directed towards configurations and methods for preventing, reducing, and/or mitigating non-uniform transmissions (e.g. dark spots and/or light spots) in an LC panel and/or LC window for automotive applications and/or architectural applications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid crystal windows present many challenges in commercialization, especially with respect to manufacture of large-dimensioned architectural windows or automotive windows. Improved performance and manufacturability are desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Smart windows incorporating a dimmable layer (e.g. a liquid crystal layer) can be used to control light transmission through the window, thereby improving occupant comfort and reducing energy costs. Liquid crystal windows using thick glass are very heavy, as the thick glass greatly increases the weight of the LC cell, which also contributes to difficulty transporting and installing the window.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a method is provided, comprising: providing a first glass layer and a second glass layer; wherein the first glass layer comprises a first surface and a second surface, and the second glass layer comprises a first surface and a second surface, surface polishing at least one of: the first surface of the first glass layer; the second surface of the first glass layer; the first surface of the second glass layer; and the second surface of the second glass layer to provide at least one polished layer on at least one of the first glass layer and the second glass layer; assembling a plurality of LC panel component layers to form a stack, wherein the LC panel component layers comprise: the first glass layer; a first interlayer; an LC cell; a second interlayer; and the second glass layer; removing any entrained air between the LC panel component layers of the stack to form a curable stack; laminating the curable stack to form a liquid crystal panel; wherein via the surface polishing step, the liquid crystal panel is configured with a uniform transmission.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, during the assembling step, the at least one polished layer is facing one of: the first interlayer or the second interlayer.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, surface polishing at least one of: the first surface of the first glass layer;

For instance, one side of SLG may have significantly more surface discontinuities than the other, as a function of manufacture from the float or tempering process. Thus, by positioning the smoother surface (e.g. the surface with fewer/lesser surface discontinuities) of at least one SLG layer (or both SLG layers) towards the LC cell, dark spots can be prevented, reduced, and/or eliminated in lamination.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a third embodiment, selectively positioning comprises positioning the first glass layer and the second glass layer such that the layers have in corresponding aligning bow coincident between sheet geometries.

However, such glass has thickness &#x3c;1 mm, and so is not rigid enough to withstand exposure to the wind and snow loads commonly experienced by large-dimensioned windows in architectural applications. As such, liquid crystal windows of the present disclosure include an LC cell having thin glass (e.g. less than 1 mm), which are laminated to thick (&#x3e;3 mm) pieces of soda lime glass (SLG) for additional strength and/or support. The SLG is tempered (per ASTM C1048) for additional strength and breakage protection, however, the tempering process is known to induce out-of-plane distortion in the SLG, which can be significant, impacting the LC panel.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">After lamination, if the thin glass(es) from the LC cell is well-adhered to the SLG, the out-of-plane distortion from the SLG can pull on the thin glass, which may drive stresses acting on the LC cell, including locally increasing the LC cell gap and/or producing undesirable local changes in visual appearance. The LC panel or resulting LC window can have spots of non-uniform transmission, or regions having 2% or greater variation in visible light transmission relative to the average visible light transmission across the visible area of the panel (e.g. dark spots or light spots). Without being bound by any particular mechanism or theory, non-uniform transmission areas or regions are believed to be attributed to a thicker cell gap in the LC cell, which is generated during manufacturing of the LC window.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">One or more advantages of using thin glass to fabricate the LC cell include: (a) compatibility with existing LCD fabrication equipment; lower window weight, making it easier to transport and install and lowering overall carbon footprint; higher visible light transmission in the clear state; thinner overall window structures, and/or additional room for gas in an IGU, thereby improving the insulation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">One or more embodiments of the present disclosure are directed towards configurations and methods for reducing, preventing, and/or eliminating areas or regions of non-uniform transmission (e.g. dark spots or light spots) in an LC panel. Thus, one or more LC panels of the present disclosure are configured with uniform transmission (e.g. regions at no greater than 2% variation in visible light transmission relative to the average visible light transmission across an adjacent area (visible area) of the window).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, dark spots or light spots (&#x2018;spots&#x2019;) are detectable by visual observation (in a static mode of the liquid crystal window, spots, if any are detectable in at least one of the first contrast state and the second contrast state, where the contrast states are an on position and an off position.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, a spot means that transmission of the window in a region is greater than 2% lower transmission in the dark spot region, as compared to the surrounding, non-dark spot region.
