In detecting cardiovascular diseases, different detection methods are used according to physical conditions, such as blood drawing, electrocardiogram, cardiac ultrasound detection, cardiac computer tomography, etc. The conventional detection methods all require a lot of time for preparation in advance and waiting for the detection result report. Patients undergoing for example: cardiac coronary angiography (CTA) must fast for 6 to 8 hours first, and need to bear the risk of allergy caused by injection of contrast agent. Since the beating frequency of the heart is a fixed bass frequency. At the same time, relying only on the heart sounds emitted by the heart, the detection accuracy is very limited. Furthermore, more detailed and more specific data cannot be detected.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, the problem that the detection of cardiovascular diseases takes a lot of time now and how to improve the accuracy of detecting cardiovascular data need to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a primary object of the present disclosure to provide a cardiovascular detection system and method that ensures a fast, convenient, and high detection accuracy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the present disclosure, an active compression cuff is provided to contract at a frequency higher than the systolic frequency of the heart. Meanwhile, a detection device (such as an electronic stethoscope) is used to capture a physiological information of a part to be detected about the influence of the active compression cuff and the cardiac systole on the blood. In addition, an electrocardiography monitor is employed to monitor an electrocardiogram spectrum information of cardiac contraction, so as to distinguish in the physiological information the pulse wave generated by the active compression cuff and the pulse wave generated by the heart. According to a time difference and a waveform density between waveforms in the physiological information spectrum, it can be determined whether the blood vessel is blocked or hardened. In this way, the detection device of the present disclosure can quickly understand the state of the cardiovascular system of the patient. Moreover, since the active compression cuff is contracted at a frequency higher than the systolic frequency of the heart, it can be more accurately determined whether the blood vessel is blocked or hardened.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram I of the structure of a cardiovascular detection system according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram II of the structure of a cardiovascular detection system according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram I of the implementation of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram II of the implementation of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram III of the implementation of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram IV of the implementation of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram V of the implementation of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system for detecting heart and blood vessels according to the present disclosure includes a detection device <b>1</b>, which is in information connection with an active compression cuff <b>2</b> and an electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b>. The detection device <b>1</b> can be used to detect the cardiovascular condition of a patient, and mainly includes a central processing unit <b>11</b>, which is in information connection with a detection unit <b>12</b>, a data storage unit <b>13</b>, a comparison unit <b>14</b>, and a display unit <b>15</b>. The active compression cuff <b>2</b> can be used to continuously compress the patient's blood vessels at a contraction frequency higher than the systolic frequency of the heart for a certain period of time. The active compression cuff <b>2</b> includes a control unit <b>21</b> which is electrically connected with a pulse pressure unit <b>22</b>. The electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b> can be used to measure the electrophysiological activity of the heart of the patient.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The central processing unit <b>11</b> can be used to drive all units of the detection device <b>1</b>, and has the functions of receiving and transmitting information signals, logical operations, temporary storage of operation results, and storage of execution command positions. It can be a central processing unit (CPU) or a microcontroller unit (MCU).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The detection unit <b>12</b> can be one or more vibration sensors. It employs the oscillometric method to acquire the physiological information of the patient. The physiological information may include spectrograms of systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures of blood flowing from the apical artery to the radial artery to cause the vibration of the vessel wall.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The data storage unit <b>13</b> can be used to store electronic data, such as a cuff spectrum information, an electrocardiogram spectrum information, a disease symptom information, etc. It can be a solid state disk or solid state drive, a hard disk drive, a static random access memory, a random access memory, a cloud drive, or a combination thereof. The cuff spectrum information includes the cuff spectrogram generated by the active compression cuff <b>2</b> corresponding to the contraction frequency. For example, if the active compression cuff <b>2</b> is set to contract three times per second, the cuff spectrogram is the one with the contraction frequency of 3 Hz. The electrocardiogram spectrum information includes the electrocardiogram spectrogram obtained by measuring patients (having such as different genders, ages, or various physiological diseases) through the electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b>. The disease symptom information is the physiological symptoms corresponding to various physiological diseases (such as blockage or hardening of blood vessels, resulting in slow blood flow), the cuff spectrum information and the electrocardiogram spectrum information corresponding to various physiological diseases (for example, if the blood vessel is blocked or hardened, the waveform of the spectrogram will produce time difference or dense waveform), and a detection information obtained by use of the active compression cuff <b>2</b> and the electrocardiography monitor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The comparison unit <b>14</b> is used to compare the physiological information (including a time difference and a waveform density between the waveforms in the spectrogram) captured by the detection unit <b>12</b> with the electrocardiogram spectrum information (measured synchronously with the electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b>), the cuff spectrum information corresponding to the contraction frequency, and the disease symptom information, thereby producing a comparison result about the suspected physiological symptoms of the patient.

The difference between another embodiment and the above-mentioned embodiment is that the cardiovascular detection system of the present disclosure mainly includes a detection device <b>1</b>, which is only in information connection with the active compression cuff <b>2</b>. The comparison unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the detection device <b>1</b> can be an artificial intelligence unit, which can be trained and learned through machine learning such as supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning or heuristic algorithms, but not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The comparison unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>uses a plurality of basic information of different persons pre-stored in the data storage unit <b>13</b> as input data. Basic information may include gender, age, or physical condition, etc., but not limited thereto. The corresponding electrocardiogram spectrum information is used as the target data for conducting a first machine learning to solve the doubts about the individual differences in cardiovascular function. Next, the comparison unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>uses a plurality of cuff spectrum information (corresponding to the contraction frequency of the active compression cuff) pre-stored in the data storage unit <b>13</b> as input data. A plurality of disease symptom information about cardiovascular disease can be used as target data for conducting a second machine learning to establish a detection model. The comparison unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>removes the electrocardiogram spectrum information from the physiological information captured by the detection unit <b>12</b>, and generates a retained information about the active compression cuff <b>2</b> having influence. Moreover, the detection model compares the retained information and the cuff spectrum information according to the time difference and the waveform density. Then, a difference result obtained by the comparison is compared with the disease symptom information. Finally, a comparison result about the suspected physiological symptoms of the patient is obtained. For example, if there is a time difference between waveforms, it means that the blood cannot return within the normal time, and it is judged that the blood vessel is blocked by blood lipids. If the waveform density is too high, it means that the blood can only pass through the narrowed blood vessels, resulting in higher frequency vibration/fluctuation, which means that the blood vessels have poor elasticity. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the flowchart of the cardiovascular detection method. The method includes the following steps:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Step S<b>10</b> of setting an active compression cuff: As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an active compression cuff <b>2</b> is fixed on a patient U. A pulse pressure unit <b>22</b> is set through a control unit <b>21</b> to repeatedly inflate and deflate (pressurize and depressurize) within a certain period of time according to a systolic frequency. The contraction frequency is higher than the systolic frequency of the heart. In performing the step S<b>10</b> of setting an active compression cuff, another step S<b>11</b> of setting electrocardiogram is simultaneously performed. The electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b> is used to record the electrophysiological activity of the heart of the patient U. The electrocardiography monitor <b>3</b> transmits the measured electrocardiogram spectrum information to the detection device <b>1</b> synchronously and stores it in a data storage unit <b>13</b> of the detection device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Step S<b>20</b> of capturing a physiological signal: As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the detection device <b>1</b> can be an electronic stethoscope. A detection unit <b>12</b> of the detection device <b>1</b> is placed on a part to be detected of the patient U. A physiological information obtained by the oscillometric method may include spectrograms of systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures of blood flowing from the apical artery to the radial artery to cause the vibration of the vessel wall. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows another embodiment of the present disclosure. The detection unit <b>12</b> of the detection device <b>1</b> can be a plurality of patch-type vibration sensors to capture the physiological information of a plurality of parts to be detected of the patient U. In this way, the electronic stethoscope only using one vibration sensor can be replaced so as to reduce the time for the user to repeat the operation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The step S<b>30</b> of detecting a physiological disease: A time difference and a waveform density between waveforms in the physiological information spectrogram are compared through the comparison unit <b>14</b> of the detection device <b>1</b> with the electrocardiogram spectrum information synchronously measured by the electrocardiograph <b>3</b>, the cuff spectrum information (corresponding to the contraction frequency) and disease symptom information in the data storage unit <b>13</b>, thereby obtaining a comparison result about the suspected physiological symptoms of the patient U.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In performing the step S<b>30</b> of detecting the physiological disease, another step S<b>31</b> of synchronizing a time axis.

Meanwhile, another step S<b>32</b> of removing a spectral noise is performed. The comparison unit <b>14</b> removes the electrocardiogram information from the physiological information spectrum, and generates a retained information about the active compression cuff <b>2</b> having influence. In addition, a further step S<b>33</b> of determining the physiological disease through comparison is performed. The comparison unit <b>14</b> compares the retained information about the active compression cuff <b>2</b> having influence with the cuff spectrum information according to the time difference and the waveform density in the retained information. Then, a difference result obtained by the comparison is compared with the disease symptom information. Finally, a comparison result about the suspected physiological symptoms of the patient U is obtained. For example, if there is a time difference between waveforms, it means that the blood cannot return within the normal time, and it is judged that the blood vessel is blocked by blood lipids. If the waveform density is too high, it means that the blood can only pass through the narrowed blood vessels, resulting in higher frequency vibration/fluctuation, which means that the blood vessels have poor elasticity. Since the contraction frequency of the active compression cuff is greater than the systolic frequency of the heart, the user can more accurately determine whether the blood vessel is blocked or hardened according to the waveform in the comparison result.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Step S<b>40</b> of outputting a comparison result: Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the physiological information and the comparison result are presented through a display unit <b>15</b> of the detection device <b>1</b>, so that the user can know and observe the physiological condition of the patient U, and record it as the disease symptom information in the data storage unit <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, before performing the step S<b>10</b> of setting the active compression cuff, a further step S<b>00</b> of establishing a detection model is performed in advance: A comparison unit <b>14</b> of the detection device <b>1</b> conducts training and learning through machine learning. A plurality of pieces of basic information (stored in the data storage unit <b>13</b>) about different persons are used as input data. The basic information can be gender, age, or physical condition, etc., but not limited thereto.

After removing the electrocardiogram spectrum information from the physiological information, the difference between the physiological information and the normal spectrum information that should be produced by the active compression cuff is determined through comparison according to the time difference and waveform density between the waveforms. Then, the difference is compared with the disease symptom information to identify whether the blood vessel is blocked or hardened. In this way, the state of the cardiovascular system of the patient can be quickly obtained through the detection device of the present disclosure. Meanwhile, a large amount of time cost can be reduced. Since the active compression cuff is contracted at a frequency higher than the systolic frequency of the heart, the accuracy of detecting cardiovascular-related data can be improved. As a result, a cardiovascular detection system and method can achieve a fast, convenient, and high detection accuracy.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">REFERENCE SIGN</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0031"><b>1</b> detection device</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0032"><b>11</b> central processing unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0033"><b>12</b> detection unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0034"><b>13</b> data storage unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0035"><b>14</b>, <b>14</b><i>a </i>comparison unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0036"><b>15</b> display unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0037"><b>2</b> active compression cuff</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0038"><b>21</b> control unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0039"><b>22</b> pulse pressure unit</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0040"><b>3</b> electrocardiography monitor</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0041">U patient</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0042">S<b>00</b> establishing detection model</li>    <li id="ul0001-0013" num="0043">S<b>10</b> setting active compression cuff</li>    <li id="ul0001-0014" num="0044">S<b>11</b> setting electrocardiogram</li>    <li id="ul0001-0015" num="0045">S<b>20</b> capturing physiological signal</li>    <li id="ul0001-0016" num="0046">S<b>30</b> detecting physiological disease</li>    <li id="ul0001-0017" num="0047">S<b>31</b> synchronizing time axis</li>    <li id="ul0001-0018" num="0048">S<b>32</b> removing spectral noise</li>    <li id="ul0001-0019" num="0049">S<b>33</b> determining physiological disease through comparison</li>    <li id="ul0001-0020" num="0050">S<b>40</b> outputting comparison result</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
