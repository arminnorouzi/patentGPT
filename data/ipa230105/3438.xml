Such beverages are often distributed in and consumed from beverage containers, but these beverages are not always obtained at a cold temperature; and even if obtained when cold, their containers typically offer little to no insulation for maintaining the cold temperatures desired by consumers. Furthermore, refrigeration of the beverage containers in a refrigerator or cooler can take a substantial amount of time.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Beverage containers can be more rapidly cooled by exposure to cooled gas or liquid in motion. For example, a beverage container can be submerged into a drum containing a supercooled liquid that is pumped to flow around the beverage container. However, as with the refrigerator or portable cooler, consumers must be near the drum, ready to consume the beverage before the poorly insulated beverage container allows the temperature to rise. In addition, supercooled liquid is often expensive to procure and maintain at desired temperature, and the pump can be costly to run and keep in service.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Manual rotation of beverage containers in a suitable cooling medium, such as ice water, can be an effective solution, speeding up the cooling process. However, this can be time consuming and inefficient because it is difficult to obtain, and maintain a high rotation speed. Motorized rotational devices have been developed to assist in the rapid chilling of beverage containers; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 10,034,565 for several such devices developed by the applicant of this document. However, there remains room for improvement and advancement in such devices' functionality and performance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects of the present disclosure, in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated features of the disclosure, and is intended neither to identify key or critical elements of all aspects of the disclosure nor to delineate the scope of any or all aspects of the disclosure. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This disclosure describes and enables a beverage cooling device that rotates or spins a beverage container in a cooling medium (e.g., ice), to provide rapid cooling of the contents of canned or bottled beverages. In some embodiments, the beverage cooling device is a hand held, buoyant, water tight device that easily engages the top of a can, bottle, or other suitable beverage container. The beverage cooling device includes a housing for a motor, and an attached container engagement member for engaging or holding the beverage container. The container engagement member is coupled to the motor and rotatably engaged with the housing, such that the container engagement member is able to freely rotate relative to the housing. The container engagement member may be attached to a drive shaft of the motor such that it is able to rotate when the motor is actuated. In some examples, the motor is actuated by an on/off switch or button. The motor rotates the container engagement member when actuated, thus enabling the rotation of an engaged bottle, can, or other container. Rapid rotation of the beverage container in contact with a chilling substance such as ice or ice water results in a rapid chilling of the contents of the beverage container.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and other aspects of the invention will become more fully understood upon a review of the detailed description, which follows.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> is a hand held device having a housing <b>102</b> with a top wall <b>104</b> disposed inside an annular side wall <b>106</b> for encasing a motor (not shown) operatively connected to a power supply (not shown), e.g., a rechargeable battery or disposable batteries. The side wall <b>106</b> includes a lower end <b>108</b> that is disposed opposite an upper end <b>110</b>, the upper end <b>110</b> being positioned adjacent to and extending about the top wall <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, a plurality of divots <b>112</b> are radially spaced about a circumference of the side wall <b>106</b>; and each divot <b>112</b> extends approximately from the upper end <b>110</b> to the lower end <b>108</b>. The divots <b>112</b> further extend into the side wall <b>106</b> to define a concavely curved profile, allowing for ergonomic interaction between a user's fingers and the side wall <b>16</b> by way of the divots <b>112</b>. In addition, the divots <b>112</b> allow for engagement with a cold medium (e.g. ice) so as to reduce or prevent rotation of the housing <b>102</b> and, combined with the buoyant properties of the housing <b>102</b>, to maintain a stable posture during operation. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the divots <b>112</b> may have an oval-shape that is contorted at angle between the upper end <b>110</b> and the lower end <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A power button <b>114</b> is located on the side wall <b>106</b> within one of the plurality of divots <b>112</b> for on/off actuation of the motor (not shown). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the power button <b>114</b> may be disc-shaped and mounted flush within the divot <b>112</b>. In addition, the housing <b>102</b> includes a plug <b>116</b> located in another of the plurality of divots <b>112</b> different and spaced apart from the power button <b>114</b>. The plug <b>116</b> may be removably sealingly connected to the housing <b>102</b> for enclosing an electrical connection to the power supply (not shown).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additional features of the present invention are contemplated. For example, the top wall <b>104</b> may carry a number of indicia, or a label, or branding, or ornamentation, or a screen or display, or a pattern, or lights (e.g., LED lights), or a hook onto which a tether may be fastened, or a transmitter or a receiver. It is contemplated that the divots <b>112</b> may be shaped differently than as depicted herein, disposed at a different angle, and differently sized. In the present example, there are five divots <b>112</b>, but it is contemplated that there may be any number of divots <b>112</b> disposed along the side wall <b>106</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. For example, there may be three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, ten or more divots <b>112</b> provided on the housing <b>102</b>, to improve grip and stability during operation. It is further contemplated that the housing may take any other suitable form or shape that provides for engagement with a cooling medium, not being limited to a form that includes divots as described herein. It is contemplated that the power button <b>114</b> and the plug <b>116</b> may be located elsewhere on the housing <b>102</b>, such as on the top wall <b>104</b> or on the side wall <b>106</b> between the divots <b>112</b>. It is further contemplated that the power button <b>114</b> and the plug <b>116</b> may be spaced apart from the housing <b>102</b> along a tether or cord (not shown). In some aspects, the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> may be controlled remotely via an internet or Bluetooth&#xae; connection with a controller or a smart phone.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is bottom perspective view of the exemplary beverage cooling device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> also has a container engagement assembly including a chassis <b>130</b> and a chuck <b>150</b>. The chassis <b>130</b> is disposed within the cavity <b>118</b> of the housing <b>102</b>, the cavity being defined beneath the top wall <b>104</b> and within the side wall <b>106</b>, such that the cavity <b>118</b> extends from an underside of the top wall <b>104</b> to the lower end <b>108</b> of the side wall <b>106</b>. The chassis <b>130</b> includes a drive ring <b>132</b> exposed below the lower end <b>108</b> of the side wall <b>106</b>. The chassis <b>130</b>, including the drive ring <b>132</b>, may be composed of a rigid material, e.g., a thermoplastic or a thermopolymer. Due in part to the material, the chassis <b>130</b>, including the drive ring <b>132</b>, may be designed and configured to resist deformation or flexure, to be light weight, to be water-resistant and quick-drying, and to have appealing aesthetic or optical properties. In other examples, a housing <b>102</b> may not include a cavity <b>118</b>; and the chassis <b>130</b> may instead be coupled to a bottom surface spanning across the lower end <b>108</b> of the housing <b>102</b>. Regardless, the chassis <b>130</b> is rotatably coupled to the motor (not shown) so as to rotate about a rotation axis A, the chassis <b>130</b> also being rotatable relative to and independently of the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the present example, the drive ring <b>132</b> is annularly disposed along the lower end <b>108</b> and extends or projects inward from the lower end <b>108</b> at a downward angle relative to the top wall <b>104</b>. The drive ring <b>132</b> carries a plurality of teeth <b>134</b> that connect to a plurality of ramps <b>136</b> spaced radially apart therealong. The plurality of teeth <b>134</b> and the plurality of ramps <b>136</b> are disposed adjacent one another, such that each tooth <b>134</b> is positioned adjacent each ramp <b>136</b>. In the present example, the plurality of teeth <b>134</b> and the plurality of ramps <b>136</b> extend inwardly as inward projections into a receptacle <b>138</b> defined within the chassis <b>130</b>, with each ramp <b>136</b> sloping inwardly toward each tooth <b>134</b> and each tooth <b>134</b> extending farther inwardly toward the rotation axis A and into the receptacle <b>138</b> than each ramp <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, drive ring <b>132</b> receives a container engagement member or chuck <b>150</b> within the receptacle <b>138</b> and among the plurality of teeth <b>134</b> and the plurality of ramps <b>136</b>. In the illustrated example, the chuck <b>150</b> is a unitary, web-like structure that is removably engaged and axially aligned with the chassis <b>130</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>). In some examples, the chuck <b>150</b> may be composed of a different material than the chassis. For example, the chuck <b>150</b> may be formed of a flexible, resilient, and/or elastic material, e.g., silicone, thermoplastic polyurethane, ethylene vinyl acetate, or another suitable material. Due in part to the geometry and material, the chuck <b>150</b> is designed and configured to expand and stretch to accommodate beverage containers of a variety of shapes and sizes, such, e.g., cylindrical, frusto-conical, rectangular, triangular, polygonal, or any other geometry used for containing a beverage.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, due to its geometry and material, the chuck <b>150</b> can accommodate beverage containers of varying materials, such as, e.g., glass, metal or metal alloy, cardboard, polymeric, composite, or any other material suitable for containing a beverage. That is, some implementations of a beverage cooling device according to the aspects and features disclosed herein may be capable of securely gripping and spinning a wide range of beverage container shapes and sizes, such as a small, rectangular cardboard juice box, a long-neck glass bottle, a cylindrical aluminum can, and/or many other sizes, shapes, and materials.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, the chuck <b>150</b> may be designed to resiliently return to its original shape, to be water resistant and quick-drying, to be easily cleaned, to remain sanitary, to withstand exposure to wide-ranging temperatures for prolonged periods, to provide sufficient friction and sealing function with a container so as to maintain a firm grip while being submersed in liquid or gaseous mediums, or a combination thereof, and to have appealing aesthetic or optical properties. For example, the chuck <b>150</b> may have multiple colorations or patterns thereon, or may contain phosphor that can be energized by exposure to light to allow some or all of the chuck <b>150</b> to radiate visible light in the dark (e.g., glow in the dark), or the chuck <b>150</b> may be partially or entirely transparent or translucent.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the chuck <b>150</b> includes an inner tube <b>152</b> (e.g., a band or a flange) having a generally tubular shape, and a flared lip <b>154</b> protrudes from an end of tube <b>152</b>. The tube <b>152</b> includes an inner surface <b>156</b> and an outer surface <b>158</b>, the inner surface <b>156</b> forming an aperture or mouth <b>160</b> for receiving at least a portion of a beverage container (e.g., an end of a beverage container as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). A plurality of collapsible projections or springs <b>162</b> extend from the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>, each of the springs <b>162</b> having an open, generally tubular shape with an inner opening or gap <b>164</b> being defined between the outer surface <b>158</b> and each spring <b>162</b>. Further, an outer gap <b>166</b> is defined between each spring <b>162</b> and adjacent the drive ring <b>132</b>. When the chuck <b>150</b> is installed within the receptacle <b>138</b> of the chassis <b>130</b>, the springs <b>162</b> removably and slidably contact the drive ring <b>132</b>. Differently said, the springs <b>162</b> can be pressed against the drive ring <b>132</b> so as to become partially deformed or compressed toward the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the plurality of springs <b>162</b> may be radially symmetrically arranged along the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>. The outer gap <b>166</b> may be disposed in-between each spring <b>162</b>. In the illustrated example, a ratio of springs <b>162</b> to teeth <b>134</b> is 1:1 and a ratio of teeth <b>134</b> to ramps <b>136</b> is also 1:1. In the present example, there are five springs <b>162</b>, five teeth <b>134</b>, and five ramps <b>136</b>. However, it is contemplated that there may be greater or fewer springs <b>162</b>, teeth <b>134</b>, and/or ramps <b>136</b>, such as four, or three, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or even ten springs <b>162</b>, teeth <b>134</b>, and ramps <b>136</b>. It is also contemplated that the ratio of springs <b>162</b> to teeth <b>134</b> could be different from 1:1, and that the ratio of teeth <b>134</b> to ramps <b>136</b> could be different from 1:1. Further, it is contemplated that the springs <b>162</b> may be triangular- (as illustrated), rectangular-, trapezodial-, cylindrical-, hexagonal-, or otherwise polygonal-shaped.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each spring <b>162</b> has a spring force that can be manipulated by the particular geometry, thickness, and material selected. In combination, the spring force of each spring <b>162</b> compounds to cause compression (e.g., symmetrical compression) of a beverage container inserted into the mouth <b>160</b> of the chuck <b>150</b>. In some examples, a non-linear spring constant may be desired, such that the insertion force (i.e., the force required to insert a beverage container into the mouth <b>160</b>) remains relatively constant from start to finish. However, in other examples, a linear spring constant may be utilized, such that the amount of insertion force may vary linearly as a function of deformation or deflection distance of the springs <b>162</b>. In a similar fashion, the tube <b>152</b> may be generally frusto-conical to define a narrowing inner diameter and, thus, a narrowing mouth <b>160</b>. Likewise, the springs <b>162</b> may have inwardly facing walls that are angled relative to the rotational axis A, such that the springs <b>162</b> project farther outwardly from the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b> near the flared lip <b>154</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning back to the present example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each spring <b>162</b> may be arranged to abut one of the ramps <b>136</b> and one of the teeth <b>134</b>. More specifically, when the chuck <b>150</b> is inserted into the receptacle <b>138</b>, each spring <b>162</b> engages at least one ramp <b>136</b> and one tooth <b>134</b>. Each spring <b>162</b> may become slightly compressed and, thus, slightly deformed, as a result of its engagement with the ramp <b>136</b> and the tooth <b>134</b>. In this way, the chuck <b>150</b>, by way of the plurality of springs <b>162</b>, nests within the receptacle <b>138</b> of the chassis <b>130</b>. Further, the geometry, number, and arrangement of the springs <b>162</b> may be configured to provide particular performance properties during use with a beverage container.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the chassis <b>130</b> may further include a disc-shaped base <b>170</b> with a centrally located hub <b>172</b> from which support fins <b>174</b> extend outwardly, the support fins <b>174</b> being radially symmetrically spaced about the hub <b>172</b>. Near the hub <b>172</b>, the support fins <b>174</b> may have a similar depth or thickness as the hub <b>172</b>, but each support fin <b>174</b> may gradually thin as it extends away from hub <b>172</b>. The hub <b>172</b> may receive a drive shaft <b>176</b> that is rotatably coupled to the motor (not shown) for applying torque to the chassis <b>130</b> to cause rotation thereof about rotation axis A. In addition, a plurality of bearings <b>178</b> may be located in the base <b>170</b>, the bearings <b>178</b> being spaced equidistant from and radially symmetrically about the hub <b>172</b>. The tube <b>152</b> may extend downwardly from the base <b>170</b> and concentrically about the hub <b>172</b>, such that each spring <b>162</b> is also spaced equidistant from and radially symmetrically about the hub <b>172</b>. As such, the drive shaft <b>176</b> may be coupled to the chuck <b>150</b> by way of the chassis <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of the chassis <b>130</b> and the chuck <b>150</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the hub <b>172</b> may extend from the base <b>170</b> and may define an opening <b>180</b> therethrough. An axle <b>182</b> may extend from each bearing <b>178</b>, and each axle <b>182</b> may be removably and rotatably received by clips <b>184</b> formed inside each corresponding aperture <b>186</b> of the base <b>170</b>. The bearings <b>178</b> facilitate rotation of the chassis <b>130</b> within the housing <b>102</b> by reducing frictional forces when the motor (not shown) is actuated to rotate the drive shaft <b>176</b>. In the present example, there are three bearings <b>178</b> and three apertures <b>186</b>. It is contemplated that any suitable number of bearings <b>178</b> may be used and that multiple bearings <b>178</b> may be disposed within a single aperture <b>186</b>. A side wall <b>188</b> may extend from a periphery of the base <b>170</b> and at an outward angle relative to a vertical axis extending through the opening <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the side wall <b>188</b> may further include a plurality of notches <b>190</b> formed therealong, such that the notches <b>190</b> are radially symmetrically spaced about the hub <b>172</b> and extend from the base <b>170</b> toward a peripheral rim <b>192</b> that defines an outermost diameter of the chassis <b>130</b>. The peripheral rim <b>192</b> may be coupled to the drive ring <b>132</b>, thereby coupling the drive ring <b>132</b> to the base <b>170</b> to form the chassis <b>130</b>. Further, the peripheral rim <b>192</b> can sealingly but rotatably couple the housing <b>102</b> with the chassis <b>130</b>, thereby reducing or preventing moisture from traveling beyond the chassis <b>130</b> toward the motor (not shown) and power supply (not shown). Each notch <b>190</b> may have a generally trapezoidal shape with a narrow end positioned to interrupt a peripheral edge of the base <b>170</b> and a wide end located proximate the peripheral rim <b>192</b>. Further, the number of notches <b>190</b> may correspond to the number of springs <b>162</b>, as will be appreciated from the description below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each spring <b>162</b> defines an apex <b>196</b> located at an end of the spring <b>162</b> opposite the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>. A tab <b>198</b> may extend from the apex <b>196</b> of each spring <b>162</b>, each tab <b>198</b> having a hook <b>200</b> that extends vertically above and inwardly from the tab <b>198</b> to form an arcuate profile. Each hook <b>200</b> may extend toward and above the inner gap <b>164</b> of each spring <b>162</b>, and each tab <b>198</b> may extend laterally and outwardly from each apex <b>196</b> of each spring <b>162</b>, such that the apex <b>196</b> is slightly offset from a center of the tab <b>198</b>. Accordingly, there may be a plurality of tabs <b>198</b> and a plurality of hooks <b>200</b> spaced radially symmetrically about the tube <b>152</b>, such that the plurality of tabs <b>198</b> define an outermost diameter of the chuck <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a top perspective view of the chassis <b>130</b> and the chuck <b>150</b> is depicted with the chassis <b>130</b> shown partially transparent or translucent. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the chuck <b>150</b> is received within the receptacle <b>138</b> of the chassis <b>130</b> so that each tab <b>198</b> is aligned within each notch <b>190</b> and each hook <b>200</b> fits onto the base <b>170</b>. To reach the assembled state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a user may perform the following steps: (a) orient the chuck <b>150</b> so that each tab <b>198</b> and hook <b>200</b> is radially offset from the ramps <b>136</b>; (b) insert the chuck <b>150</b> into the receptacle <b>138</b> until the hooks <b>200</b> abut the base <b>170</b>, (c) rotate the chuck <b>150</b> so that the tabs <b>198</b> slide within the drive ring <b>132</b> along the ramps <b>136</b> toward the teeth <b>134</b>, and (d) ensure the tabs <b>198</b> fit into the respective notches <b>190</b> and the hooks <b>200</b> snap onto the base <b>170</b>. In this way, the chuck <b>150</b> is removably installed within the chassis <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the chuck <b>150</b>, including the tabs <b>198</b> and the hooks <b>200</b>, may be formed of an elastic polymer material offering substantial flexibility, a user can manipulate the tabs <b>198</b> and the hooks <b>200</b> as needed to facilitate assembly with the chassis <b>130</b>. However, because the material properties of the chuck <b>150</b> also include substantial resilience, the chuck <b>150</b> is securely fastened to the chassis <b>130</b>, even against forces experienced during rotation of the chuck <b>150</b> during use and during repeated insertion and removal of a beverage container. In this manner, and in combination with its unique geometry, the chuck <b>150</b> is designed to grip, spin, and release a variety of beverage containers, while further being adapted for use within a variety of cooling mediums.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> illustrate a bottom perspective view of a beverage container <b>300</b> and the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> according to some aspects of this disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> is fully assembled so that the chuck <b>150</b> is secured to the chassis <b>130</b>. An exemplary process of using the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> includes aligning the mouth <b>160</b> of the tube <b>152</b> with an end <b>302</b> of the beverage container <b>300</b>, inserting the end <b>302</b> of the beverage container <b>300</b> into the mouth <b>160</b>, pressing the beverage container <b>300</b> and the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> together so that the tube <b>152</b> expands to fit around the end <b>302</b> of the beverage container <b>300</b>; actuating the motor (not shown) by way of depressing the power button <b>114</b> on the housing <b>102</b>; and placing the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> into contact with a cold medium (e.g., water, ice, etc.) so as to submerge the beverage container <b>300</b> while allowing rotation of the beverage container <b>300</b> by the motor (not shown) of the beverage cooling device <b>100</b>. As a result, operation of the beverage cooling device <b>100</b> by way of depressing the power button <b>114</b> causes the motor (not shown) to apply torque to a drive shaft <b>176</b>, which causes rotation of the hub <b>172</b>, which causes rotation of the chassis <b>130</b>, which causes rotation of the chuck <b>150</b>, which causes rotation of the beverage container <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the tube <b>152</b> of the chuck <b>150</b> may expand to fit around the end <b>302</b> of the beverage container <b>300</b>. To accomplish this, the tube <b>152</b> may be designed to define an inner diameter of the mouth <b>160</b> that is less than an outer diameter of the beverage container <b>300</b>. Further, as the beverage container <b>300</b> causes expansion of the tube <b>152</b>, the plurality of springs <b>162</b> may be further compressed or deformed between the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b> and the drive ring <b>132</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the inner gap <b>164</b> may be almost completely reduced by the outward movement of the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>. Accordingly, the springs <b>162</b> exert a compressive force against the expansion of the tube <b>152</b> that is imparted to the beverage container <b>300</b>. In combination with the particular material properties of the chuck <b>150</b>, the inner surface <b>156</b> of the tube <b>152</b> may form a water-tight seal with the end <b>302</b> of the beverage container <b>300</b> that provides a firm grip even when submerged in water or ice. Further, the firm grip between the chuck <b>150</b> and the beverage container <b>300</b> is maintained during operation of the beverage cooling device <b>100</b>, causing rotation of the beverage container <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the outer gap <b>166</b> may also be reduced by the outward expansion of the outer surface <b>158</b> of the tube <b>152</b>, but potentially, to a lesser extent than the inner gap <b>164</b>. Accordingly, the outer gap <b>166</b> may leave room for further expansion or deformation or even asymmetrical expansion of deformation of the chuck <b>150</b>. In this way, the chuck <b>150</b> may be configured to accommodate various sizes of beverage containers <b>300</b>, or even irregularly shaped beverage containers <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a chuck <b>400</b>.

In addition, a bridge <b>414</b> may span between each of the springs <b>402</b>, such as between the arm <b>406</b> of one spring <b>402</b> and the arm <b>408</b> of the adjacent spring <b>402</b>, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Still, the chuck <b>400</b> is configured to receive a beverage container <b>300</b> by compressing each spring <b>402</b> between the beverage container <b>300</b> and the chassis <b>130</b>.

However, in other examples, a linear spring constant may be utilized, such that the amount of insertion force may vary linearly as a function of a deformation or deflection distance of the springs <b>162</b>. For example, each inner wall <b>404</b> may be sloped or tapered in a direction parallel to the rotation axis A to provide a discontinuous frusto-conical aperture into which the beverage container <b>300</b> can be received, thereby gradually increasing the compressive force.
