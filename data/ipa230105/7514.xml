Examples of such multiple-access systems include 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) systems, LTE Advanced (LTE-A) systems, code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, to name a few.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. New Radio (NR) (e.g., 5<sup>th </sup>generation (5G)) is an example of an emerging telecommunication standard. NR is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by 3GPP. It is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using OFDMA with a cyclic prefix (CP) on a downlink (DL) and on an uplink (UL). To these ends, NR supports beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, there exists a need for further improvements in NR and LTE technology. Preferably, these improvements should be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The systems, methods, and devices of the disclosure each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes.

Changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements discussed without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Various examples may omit, substitute, or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance, the methods described may be performed in an order different from that described, and various steps may be added, omitted, or combined. Also, features described with respect to some examples may be combined in some other examples. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover such an apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to, or other than, the various aspects of the disclosure set forth herein. It should be understood that any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein may be embodied by one or more elements of a claim.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, any number of wireless networks may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network may support a particular radio access technology (RAT) and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may also be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, etc. A frequency may also be referred to as a carrier, a subcarrier, a frequency channel, a tone, a subband, etc. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless networks and radio technologies. While aspects may be described herein using terminology commonly associated with 3<sup>rd </sup>generation (3G), 4G, and/or new radio (e.g., 5G new radio (NR)) wireless technologies, aspects of the present disclosure can be applied in other generation-based communication systems.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">NR access may support various wireless communication services, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) targeting wide bandwidth, millimeter wave mmW, massive machine type communications MTC (mMTC) targeting non-backward compatible MTC techniques, and/or mission critical targeting ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). These services may include latency and reliability requirements. These services may also have different transmission time intervals (TTI) to meet respective quality of service (QoS) requirements. In addition, these services may co-exist in the same subframe.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The electromagnetic spectrum is often subdivided, based on frequency/wavelength, into various classes, bands, channels, etc. In 5G NR two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the above aspects in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like if used herein may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, or may be within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">NR supports beamforming and beam direction may be dynamically configured. MIMO transmissions with precoding may also be supported. MIMO configurations in the DL may support up to 8 transmit antennas with multi-layer DL transmissions up to 8 streams and up to 2 streams per UE.

The NR may support half-duplex operation using time division duplexing (TDD). The OFDM and single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) partition system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as tones, bins, etc. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. Modulation symbols may be sent in a frequency domain with the OFDM and in a time domain with the SC-FDM. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and a total number of subcarriers may be dependent on the system bandwidth. The minimum resource allocation, called a resource block (RB), may be 12 consecutive subcarriers. The system bandwidth may also be partitioned into subbands. For example, a subband may cover multiple RBs. The NR may support a base subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15 KHz and other SCS may be defined with respect to the base SCS (e.g., 30 kHz, 60 kHz, 120 kHz, 240 kHz, etc.).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example of a frame format <b>300</b> for NR.

In certain aspects, SSBs may be transmitted in a burst where each SSB in the burst corresponds to a different beam direction for UE-side beam management (e.g., including beam selection and/or beam refinement). The SSB includes a PSS, a SSS, and a two symbol PBCH. The SSB can be transmitted in a fixed slot location, such as the symbols 0-3 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The PSS and the SSS may be used by UEs for cell search and acquisition. The PSS may provide half-frame timing, a synchronization signal (SS) may provide a CP length and frame timing. The PSS and the SSS may provide cell identity. The PBCH carries some basic system information, such as DL system bandwidth, timing information within radio frame, SS burst set periodicity, system frame number, etc. The SSBs may be organized into SS bursts to support beam sweeping. Further system information such as, remaining minimum system information (RMSI), system information blocks (SIBs), other system information (OSI) can be transmitted on a PDSCH in certain subframes. The SSB can be transmitted up to sixty-four times, for example, with up to sixty-four different beam directions for mmWave. The multiple transmissions of the SSB are referred to as a SS burst set.

For example, the wireless communications system may support a first traffic type associated with relatively high reliability targets and relatively low latency targets, such as ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) traffic type. The wireless communication system may also support a second traffic type associated with relatively low reliability targets and relatively long latency thresholds, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic type. In some cases, to support various system operations such as efficient utilization of wireless communication resources, appropriate allocation or balancing of wireless communication resources, appropriate support of traffic according to different prioritization or latency threshold, the wireless communications system may support resource sharing between traffic types, such as a dynamic allocation of resources between URLLC communications and eMBB communications, or other communications, according to different traffic types, categories, or other prioritizations.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The wireless communications system includes a base station (BS), which schedules resources for a user equipment (UE) to use in transmission or reception, e.g., of eMBB data. The BS may become aware of a more urgent, higher priority transmission from another UE. For example, the other transmission may be from a latency sensitive UE requiring the URLLC. In such circumstances, the BS may reclaim the resources previously scheduled to a lower priority first UE for use by a higher priority second UE. If the previously scheduled resources are for an uplink (UL) transmission, the BS sends a UL cancellation indication (ULCI) in a ULCI occasion to the first UE to cancel at least a portion of the lower priority (e.g., eMBB) UL transmission from the first UE. The BS may then allocate the reclaimed resources to the higher priority, latency sensitive second UE for a higher priority (e.g., URLLC) transmission.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a BS is configured to send a ULCI when two UEs (such as a first UE and a second UE) are within a coverage of a same beam from the BS. For example, initially, the BS (or other network entity) allocates UL resources (e.g., an initial UL resource allocation) to the first UE for UL transmissions. The BS subsequently determines to perform a reallocation of the previously-allocated UL resources, which may be triggered by a need or a request to support higher-priority communications from a nearby second UE. The BS then generates and transmits the ULCI to the first UE that may correspond to at least a portion of the previously-allocated UL resources (e.g., as allocated to the first UE). The first UE is configured to monitor for the ULCI, and accordingly determines, based at least in part on received ULCI, whether or not to proceed with the UL transmissions using their previously-allocated UL resources. Based on the ULCI, the resources that were originally allocated to the first UE for eMBB communications are reallocated to the second UE for URLLC communications.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some cases, the BS sends the ULCI to the first UE via a downlink control information (DCI) such as a DCI format 2_4. The ULCI DCI contains multiple cancellation indication fields and each cancellation indication field corresponds to one UL carrier. In some cases, the ULCI is indicated to the first UE based on indicated symbol groups and resource block (RB) groups. In one example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, one RB group in one symbol group may be a smallest resource cancellation unit.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As noted above, when the BS sends the ULCI to the first UE to cancel the resources assigned to the first UE and reassign these resources to the second UE, it may imply that the first UE and the second UE are geographically close to each other. If the first UE and the second UE were not geographically close to each other, spatial domain multiplexed (SDM) resources can be allocated to the first UE and the second UE for concurrent transmissions. When the first UE and the second UE are geographically close to each other, an UL transmission from one of these UEs may be detected by another UE (e.g., similar to a cross-link interference (CLI) measurement of Rel-16).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example Cross-Link Interference (CLI)</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In Rel-16, a cross-link interference (CLI) is defined to measure interference between two user equipments (UEs) that are geographically close to each other. For example, when a first UE (i.e., an aggressor UE) is transmitting, a second UE (i.e., a victim UE) located close to the first UE may receive a transmission from the first UE as the CLI if the second UE is receiving transmissions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In Rel-16, signaling and procedure is specified for the victim UE to measure the CLI from the aggressor UE. Generally, the aggressor UE does not transmit any transmissions dedicatedly for CLI measurement by another victim UE. Also, the aggressor UE does not know that a UL transmission from the aggressor UE is being measured for the CLI by the victim UE. The victim UE measures the CLI when a base station (BS) configures CLI measurement resources to the victim UE. Based on the CLI measurement resources, the victim UE performs a periodic measurement to measure the CLI based on a sounding reference signal (SRS) reference signal receive power (RSRP) or a received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The victim UE measures the CLI from the aggressor UE based on the SRS RSRP or the RSSI, and then generates a CLI measurement report indicating the measured CLI. The victim UE sends the CLI measurement report to the BS. In some cases, based on the CLI measurement report received from the victim UE, the BS manages scheduling of the aggressor UE and the victim UE to balance a throughput of different UEs.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In Rel-16, layer 3 (such as a radio resource control (RRC) layer) CLI measurement is defined. However, layer 1 (such as a physical (PHY) layer) CLI measurement supports more prompt CLI measurement for a dynamic time division duplex (TDD). The layer 1 CLI measurement may be triggered by a downlink control information (DCI) (e.g., in a similar way to a channel state information (CSI) measurement and report).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted above, for an uplink (UL) cancellation indication (ULCI) scenario in a wireless communications system, two UEs (a first UE and a second UE) may be sufficiently close to each other. When a BS sends the ULCI to the first UE to cancel resources assigned to the first UE and reassign the cancelled resources to the second UE, the ULCI can also provide a free signaling enabling the first UE to measure potential interference from other nearby UEs (such as the second UE) UL transmission. The first UE may then generate and send a CLI measurement report indicating the measured CLI from the second UE to the BS. The BS can use the CLI measurement report to manage the first UE and the second UE, e.g., when a dynamic TDD is enabled. Accordingly, it is useful that the first UE that cancels the resources based on the ULCI measures the UL transmission from the second UE (for which the cancelled resources are reassigned to).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example ULCI Triggered CLI Measurement</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Aspects of the present disclosure provide apparatuses, methods, processing systems, and computer readable mediums for measuring cross-link interference (CLI) based on an uplink (UL) cancellation indication (ULCI).

In certain aspects, the resource granularity may indicate the UE1 to separately measure the CLI for each pair of symbol group and resource block (RB) group within the cancelled resources. In certain aspects, the resource granularity may indicate the UE1 to separately measure the CLI for each pair of symbol and RB group within the cancelled resources.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At <b>810</b>, the UE1 measures the CLI from the UE2, on the resources cancelled by the ULCI, during the UL transmission from the UE2.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In certain aspects, the UE1 does not perform the CLI measurement over the symbols that are cancelled but not explicitly indicated by the ULCI. In some examples, the UE1 may measure the CLI from the UE2 over the first set of symbols (that are explicitly indicated by the ULCI for cancellation from the UE1 and assigned to the UE2). In some examples, the UE1 may not measure the CLI from the UE2 over the second set of symbols (that were not explicitly indicated by the ULCI since the CLI measurement is not performed over the symbols that are cancelled but not explicitly indicated by the ULCI).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In certain aspects, the CLI measurement is a receiving operation and a cancelled UL is a transmission operation. In certain aspects, the CLI measurement based on the ULCI may be restricted in flexible symbols of the UE1. However, in some cases, the CLI measurement based on the ULCI may be possible in a semi-static or dynamic UL symbol if a timeline allows the UE1 to switch from the transmission operation to the receiving operation in the symbols indicated by the ULCI. In certain aspects, the UE1 may be provided with a minimum gap, to switch from its UL transmission to receiving the UE2 UL transmission, after receiving the ULCI.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some cases (such as Rel-16), a first symbol where the UE1 may cancel its UL transmission on receiving the ULCI starts after T<sub>proc,2</sub>+d symbols from an end of a reception of a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) that carries the DCI format 2_4. In T<sub>proc,2</sub>+d symbols, d&#x2208;{0,1,2} is reported as a UE1 capability. T<sub>proc,2 </sub>is a UE1 processing time for a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) when d<sub>2,1</sub>=0 and N<sub>2 </sub>of a minimum processing capability 2 is assumed. In certain aspects, the minimum gap for the UE1 to measure the CLI from the UE2, after receiving the ULCI indicating to measure the CLI, may be increased by adding a positive offset.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In certain aspects, the UE1 measures the CLI from the UE2 from a starting location in a time after a minimum gap from a reception of the ULCI. For example, a first symbol where the UE1 may measure the CLI from the UE2 starts after T<sub>proc,2</sub>+d+d<sub>cli </sub>symbols from an end of a reception of signaling that carries the ULCI (e.g., DCI format 2_4). In T<sub>proc,2</sub>+d+d<sub>cli</sub>, T<sub>proc,2</sub>+d is the minimum gap required by a regular ULCI and d<sub>cli </sub>is an additional gap for the UE1 for the CLI measurement.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In certain aspects, the UE1 measures the CLI from the UE2 based on the ULCI by measuring a received signal strength indication (RSSI) from the UE2. For example, the ULCI received by the UE1 may trigger the RSSI measurement from the UE2. The RSSI measurement may be considered as a layer 1 aperiodic CLI measurement report (e.g., in a similar way to an aperiodic channel state information (CSI) framework). In some cases (such as for 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) Rel-16), the CLI may be based on a layer 3 measurement. In some cases, the CLI measurement and report may be extended to the layer 1 measurement based on a CSI measurement and report framework. For example, in a DCI format 0_1 for aperiodic CSI triggering, one or more fields such as a CSI request field (to select one of up to 64 trigger states) and a carrier indicator field (to determine a carrier where the CSI report is transmitted) are included.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In certain aspects, the ULCI is a special triggering signaling for layer 1 CLI measurement. In some cases, for the CLI measurement from the UE2, an associated trigger state and a carrier indicator may be configured by a RRC for the ULCI triggered CLI measurement. In such cases, no additional bits have to be added in the ULCI sent to the UE1 to indicate triggering of the CLI measurement from the UE2.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In certain aspects, a trigger state may be associated with the ULCI to measure the CLI from the UE2 based on the ULCI. The UE1 then generates a CLI measurement report based on the measured CLI.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At <b>812</b>, the UE1 sends the CLI measurement report based on the measured CLI to the BS. In certain aspects, when there is more than one other UE sending UL transmissions within the cancelled resources, the UE1 may separately report the CLI measurement report for each other UE to the BS.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In certain aspects, a size of the CLI measurement report depends on the resource granularity. For example, when the resource granularity is finer, the size of the CLI measurement report is large. In certain aspects, to reduce the size of the CLI measurement report, the CLI measurement report may only indicate whether the measured CLI from the UE2 is above the CLI threshold (indicated in the CLI resource configuration).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In certain aspects, the UE sends the CLI measurement report to the BS on a UL carrier. In one non-limiting example, the UL carrier for sending the CLI measurement report may be associated with a downlink (DL) carrier where the UE receives the ULCI from the BS. In another non-limiting example, the UE carrier may be associated with a cancellation indication field indicating the cancelled resources in the ULCI. In another non-limiting example, the UL carrier may be indicated in the associated trigger state, and the UL carrier may include a configured UL carrier used to transmit the CLI measurement report in the trigger state.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Wireless Communication Devices</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a communications device <b>900</b> that may include various components (e.g., corresponding to means-plus-function components) configured to perform operations for the techniques disclosed herein, such as the operations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the processor may be any commercially available processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">If implemented in hardware, an example hardware configuration may comprise a processing system in a wireless node. The processing system may be implemented with a bus architecture. The bus may include any number of interconnecting buses and bridges depending on the specific application of the processing system and the overall design constraints. The bus may link together various circuits including a processor, machine-readable media, and a bus interface. The bus interface may be used to connect a network adapter, among other things, to the processing system via the bus. The network adapter may be used to implement the signal processing functions of the PHY layer. In the case of a user equipment (UE) <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a user interface (e.g., keypad, display, mouse, joystick, etc.) may also be connected to the bus. The bus may also link various other circuits such as timing sources, peripherals, voltage regulators, power management circuits, and the like, which are well known in the art, and therefore, will not be described any further. The processor may be implemented with one or more general-purpose and/or special-purpose processors. Examples include microprocessors, microcontrollers, DSP processors, and other circuitry that can execute software. Those skilled in the art will recognize how best to implement the described functionality for the processing system depending on the particular application and the overall design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, data, or any combination thereof, whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise. Computer-readable media include both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. The processor may be responsible for managing the bus and general processing, including the execution of software modules stored on the machine-readable storage media. A computer-readable storage medium may be coupled to a processor such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. By way of example, the machine-readable media may include a transmission line, a carrier wave modulated by data, and/or a computer readable storage medium with instructions stored thereon separate from the wireless node, all of which may be accessed by the processor through the bus interface. Alternatively, or in addition, the machine-readable media, or any portion thereof, may be integrated into the processor, such as the case may be with cache and/or general register files. Examples of machine-readable storage media may include, by way of example, RAM (Random Access Memory), flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), registers, magnetic disks, optical disks, hard drives, or any other suitable storage medium, or any combination thereof. The machine-readable media may be embodied in a computer-program product.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">A software module may comprise a single instruction, or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across multiple storage media. The computer-readable media may comprise a number of software modules. The software modules include instructions that, when executed by an apparatus such as a processor, cause the processing system to perform various functions. The software modules may include a transmission module and a receiving module. Each software module may reside in a single storage device or be distributed across multiple storage devices. By way of example, a software module may be loaded into RAM from a hard drive when a triggering event occurs. During execution of the software module, the processor may load some of the instructions into cache to increase access speed. One or more cache lines may then be loaded into a general register file for execution by the processor. When referring to the functionality of a software module below, it will be understood that such functionality is implemented by the processor when executing instructions from that software module.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared (IR), radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, include compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, and Blu-ray&#xae; disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Thus, in some aspects computer-readable media may comprise non-transitory computer-readable media (e.g., tangible media). In addition, for other aspects computer-readable media may comprise transitory computer-readable media (e.g., a signal). Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Thus, certain aspects may comprise a computer program product for performing the operations presented herein.
