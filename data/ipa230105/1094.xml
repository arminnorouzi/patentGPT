The dose detection system is operable to detect the amount of a dose of medication delivered by the medication delivery device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Patients suffering from various diseases must frequently inject themselves with medication. To allow a person to conveniently and accurately self-administer medicine, a variety of devices broadly known as pen injectors or injection pens have been developed. Generally, these pens are equipped with a cartridge including a piston and containing a multi-dose quantity of liquid medication. A drive member is movable forward to advance the piston in the cartridge to dispense the contained medication from an outlet at the distal cartridge end, typically through a needle. In disposable or prefilled pens, after a pen has been utilized to exhaust the supply of medication within the cartridge, a user discards the entire pen and begins using a new replacement pen. In reusable pens, after a pen has been utilized to exhaust the supply of medication within the cartridge, the pen is disassembled to allow replacement of the spent cartridge with a fresh cartridge, and then the pen is reassembled for its subsequent use.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many pen injectors and other medication delivery devices utilize mechanical systems in which members rotate and/or translate relative to one another in a manner proportional to the dose delivered by operation of the device. Accordingly, the art has endeavored to provide reliable systems that accurately measure the relative movement of members of a medication delivery device in order to assess the dose delivered. Such systems may include a sensor which is secured to a first member of the medication delivery device, and which detects the relative movement of a sensed component secured to a second member of the device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The administration of a proper amount of medication requires that the dose delivered by the medication delivery device be accurate. Many pen injectors and other medication delivery devices do not include the functionality to automatically detect and record the amount of medication delivered by the device during the injection event. In the absence of an automated system, a patient must manually keep track of the amount and time of each injection. Accordingly, there is a need for a device that is operable to automatically detect the dose delivered by the medication delivery device during an injection event. Further, there is a need for such a dose detection device to be removable and reusable with multiple delivery devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, a dose detection system is provided for a medication delivery device which includes a dose setting member which rotates relative to an actuator during dose delivery. The dose detection system comprises an electronics assembly attached to the actuator and a sensed element attached to the dose setting member. The electronics assembly includes a rotation sensor operable with the sensed element to detect the movement of the dose setting member relative to the actuator during dose delivery. The electronics assembly may further include various additional components such as one or more other sensors, memory, a processor, a controller, a battery, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, the dose detection system comprises a module which is removably attachable to the medication delivery device. Among other advantages, the attachable and detachable module is operative to detect a delivered medication amount without changing the functionality or operation of the medication delivery device to which it is attached. In some embodiments, the sensing system records the size of the delivered dose and communicates the information to an external device. The medication delivery device may include a medication. Other advantages will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an exemplary medication delivery device with which the dose detection system of the present disclosure is operable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional perspective view of the exemplary medication delivery device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the proximal portion of the exemplary medication delivery device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partially-exploded, perspective view of the proximal portion of the exemplary medication delivery device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and showing a dose detection module.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective, diagrammatic view, partially in cross section, of an exemplary embodiment of a dose detection system shown attached to the proximal portion of a medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective, diagrammatic view, partially in cross section, of a second exemplary embodiment of a dose detection system shown attached to the proximal portion of a medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective, diagrammatic view, partially in cross section, of a third exemplary embodiment of a dose detection system shown attached to the proximal portion of a medication delivery device.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the present disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure relates to sensing systems for medication delivery devices. In one aspect, the sensing system is for determining the amount of a dose delivered by a medication delivery device based on the sensing of relative rotational movement between a dose setting member and an actuator of the medication delivery device. The sensed relative rotational movements are correlated to the amount of the dose delivered. By way of illustration, the medication delivery device is described in the form of a pen injector. However, the medication delivery device may be any device which is used to set and to deliver a dose of a medication, such as a pen injector, an infusion pump or a syringe. The medication may be any of a type that may be delivered by such a medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Devices described herein, such as device <b>10</b>, may further comprise a medication, such as for example, within a reservoir or cartridge <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, a system may comprise one or more devices including device <b>10</b> and a medication. The term &#x201c;medication&#x201d; refers to one or more therapeutic agents including but not limited to insulins, insulin analogs such as insulin lispro or insulin glargine, insulin derivatives, GLP-1 receptor agonists such as dulaglutide or liraglutide, glucagon, glucagon analogs, glucagon derivatives, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), GIP analogs, GIP derivatives, oxyntomodulin analogs, oxyntomodulin derivatives, therapeutic antibodies and any therapeutic agent that is capable of delivery by the above device. The medication as used in the device may be formulated with one or more excipients. The device is operated in a manner generally as described above by a patient, caregiver or healthcare professional to deliver medication to a person.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An exemplary medication delivery device <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> as a pen injector configured to inject a medication into a patient through a needle. Pen injector <b>10</b> includes a body <b>11</b> comprising an elongated, pen-shaped housing <b>12</b> including a distal portion <b>14</b> and a proximal portion <b>16</b>. Distal portion <b>14</b> is received within a pen cap <b>18</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, distal portion <b>14</b> contains a reservoir or cartridge <b>20</b> configured to hold the medicinal fluid to be dispensed through its distal outlet end during a dispensing operation. The outlet end of distal portion <b>14</b> is equipped with a removable needle assembly <b>22</b> including an injection needle <b>24</b> enclosed by a removable cover <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A piston <b>26</b> is positioned in reservoir <b>20</b>. An injecting mechanism positioned in proximal portion <b>16</b> is operative to advance piston <b>26</b> toward the outlet of reservoir <b>20</b> during the dose dispensing operation to force the contained medicine through the needled end. The injecting mechanism includes a drive member <b>28</b>, illustratively in the form of a screw, axially moveable relative to housing <b>12</b> to advance piston <b>26</b> through reservoir <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A dose setting member <b>30</b> is coupled to housing <b>12</b> for setting a dose amount to be dispensed by device <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, dose setting member <b>30</b> is in the form of a screw element operative to spiral (i.e., simultaneously move axially and rotationally) relative to housing <b>12</b> during dose setting and dose dispensing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate the dose setting member <b>30</b> fully screwed into housing <b>12</b> at its home or zero dose position. Dose setting member <b>30</b> is operative to screw out in a proximal direction from housing <b>12</b> until it reaches a fully extended position corresponding to a maximum dose deliverable by device <b>10</b> in a single injection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, dose setting member <b>30</b> includes a cylindrical dose dial member <b>32</b> having a helically threaded outer surface that engages a corresponding threaded inner surface of housing <b>12</b> to allow dose setting member <b>30</b> to spiral relative to housing <b>12</b>. Dose dial member <b>32</b> further includes a helically threaded inner surface that engages a threaded outer surface of sleeve <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of device <b>10</b>. The outer surface of dial member <b>32</b> includes dose indicator markings, such as numbers that are visible through a dosage window <b>36</b> to indicate to the user the set dose amount. Dose setting member <b>30</b> further includes a tubular flange <b>38</b> that is coupled in the open proximal end of dial member <b>32</b> and is axially and rotationally locked to dose dial member <b>32</b> by detents <b>40</b> received within openings <b>41</b> in dial member <b>32</b>. Dose setting member <b>30</b> further includes a skirt or collar <b>42</b> positioned around the outer periphery of dial member <b>32</b> at its proximal end. Skirt <b>42</b> is axially and rotationally locked to dial member <b>32</b> by tabs <b>44</b> received in slots <b>46</b> formed by dose dial member <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Dose setting member <b>30</b> therefore may be considered to comprise any or all of dose dial member <b>32</b>, flange <b>38</b>, and skirt <b>42</b>, as they are all rotationally and axially fixed together. Dose dial member <b>32</b> is directly involved in setting the dose and driving delivery of the medication. Flange <b>38</b> is attached to dose dial member <b>32</b> and, as described later, cooperates with a clutch to selectively couple dose dial member <b>32</b> with a dose button.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Skirt <b>42</b> provides a surface external of body <b>11</b> to enable a user to rotate dose dial member <b>32</b> for setting a dose. Skirt <b>42</b> illustratively includes a plurality of surface features <b>48</b> and an annular ridge <b>49</b> formed on the outer surface of skirt <b>42</b>. Surface features <b>48</b> are illustratively longitudinally extending ribs and grooves that are circumferentially spaced around the outer surface of skirt <b>42</b> and facilitate a user's grasping and rotating the skirt. In an alternative embodiment, skirt <b>42</b> is removed or is integral with dial member <b>32</b>, and a user may grasp and rotate dose dial member <b>32</b> for dose setting.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Delivery device <b>10</b> includes an actuator <b>50</b> having a clutch <b>52</b> which is received within dose dial member <b>32</b>. Clutch <b>52</b> includes an axially extending stem <b>54</b> at its proximal end. Actuator <b>50</b> further includes dose button <b>56</b> positioned proximally of skirt <b>42</b> of dose setting member <b>30</b>. Dose button <b>56</b> includes a mounting collar <b>58</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) centrally located on the distal surface of dose button <b>56</b>. Collar <b>58</b> is attached to stem <b>54</b> of clutch <b>52</b>, such as with an interference fit or an ultrasonic weld, so as to axially and rotatably fix together dose button <b>56</b> and clutch <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Dose button <b>56</b> includes a disk-shaped proximal end surface or face <b>60</b> and an annular wall portion <b>62</b> extending distally and spaced radially inward of the outer peripheral edge of face <b>60</b> to form an annular lip <b>64</b> there between. Face <b>60</b> of dose button <b>56</b> serves as a push surface against which a force can be applied manually, i.e., directly by the user to push actuator <b>50</b> in a distal direction. Dose button <b>56</b> illustratively includes a recessed portion <b>66</b> centrally located on proximal face <b>60</b>, although proximal face <b>60</b> alternatively may be a flat surface. A bias member <b>68</b>, illustratively a spring, is disposed between the distal surface <b>70</b> of button <b>56</b> and a proximal surface <b>72</b> of tubular flange <b>38</b> to urge actuator <b>50</b> and dose setting member <b>30</b> axially away from each other. Dose button <b>56</b> is depressible by a user to initiate the dose dispensing operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Delivery device <b>10</b> is operable in both a dose setting mode and a dose dispensing mode. In the dose setting mode of operation, dose setting member <b>30</b> is dialed (rotated) relative to housing <b>12</b> to set a desired dose to be delivered by device <b>10</b>. Dialing in the proximal direction serves to increase the set dose, and dialing in the distal direction serves to decrease the set dose. Dose setting member <b>30</b> is adjustable in rotational increments (e.g., clicks) corresponding to the minimum incremental increase or decrease of the set dose during the dose setting operation. For example, one increment or &#x201c;click&#x201d; may equal one-half or one unit of medication. The set dose amount is visible to the user via the dial indicator markings shown through dosage window <b>36</b>. Actuator <b>50</b>, including dose button <b>56</b> and clutch <b>52</b>, move axially and rotationally with dose setting member <b>30</b> during the dialing in the dose setting mode.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Dose dial member <b>32</b>, flange <b>38</b> and skirt <b>42</b> are all fixed rotationally to one another, and rotate and extend proximally of the medication delivery device <b>10</b> during dose setting, due to the threaded connection of dose dial member <b>32</b> with housing <b>12</b>. During this dose setting motion, dose button <b>56</b> is rotationally fixed relative to skirt <b>42</b> by complementary splines <b>74</b> of flange <b>38</b> and clutch <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), which are urged together by bias member <b>68</b>. In the course of dose setting, skirt <b>42</b> and dose button <b>56</b> move relative to housing <b>12</b> in a spiral manner from a &#x201c;start&#x201d; position to an &#x201c;end&#x201d; position. This rotation relative to the housing is in proportion to the amount of dose set by operation of the medication delivery device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Once the desired dose is set, device <b>10</b> is manipulated so the injection needle <b>24</b> properly penetrates, for example, a user's skin. The dose dispensing mode of operation is initiated in response to an axial distal force applied to the proximal face <b>60</b> of dose button <b>56</b>. The axial force is applied by the user directly to dose button <b>56</b>. This causes axial movement of actuator <b>50</b> in the distal direction relative to housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The axial shifting motion of actuator <b>50</b> compresses biasing member <b>68</b> and reduces or closes the gap between dose button <b>56</b> and tubular flange <b>38</b>. This relative axial movement separates the complementary splines <b>74</b> on clutch <b>52</b> and flange <b>38</b>, and thereby disengages actuator <b>50</b>, e.g., dose button <b>56</b>, from being rotationally fixed to dose setting member <b>30</b>. In particular, dose setting member <b>30</b> is rotationally uncoupled from actuator <b>50</b> to allow backdriving rotation of dose setting member <b>30</b> relative to actuator <b>50</b> and housing <b>12</b>. Also, since dose setting member <b>30</b> and actuator <b>50</b> are free to relatively rotate, actuator <b>50</b> is held from rotating relative to device housing <b>12</b> by the user's engagement of dose button <b>56</b> by pressing against it.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As actuator <b>50</b> is continued to be axially plunged without rotation relative to housing <b>12</b>, dial member <b>32</b> screws back into housing <b>12</b> as it spins relative to dose button <b>56</b>. The dose markings that indicate the amount still remaining to be injected are visible through window <b>36</b>. As dose setting member <b>30</b> screws down distally, drive member <b>28</b> is advanced distally to push piston <b>26</b> through reservoir <b>20</b> and expel medication through needle <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">During the dose dispensing operation, the amount of medicine expelled from the medication delivery device is proportional to the amount of rotational movement of the dose setting member <b>30</b> relative to actuator <b>50</b> as the dial member <b>32</b> screws back into housing <b>12</b>. The injection is completed when the internal threading of dial member <b>32</b> has reached the distal end of the corresponding outer threading of sleeve <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Device <b>10</b> is then once again arranged in a ready state or zero dose position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The dose delivered may be derived based on the rotation of dose setting member <b>30</b> relative to actuator <b>50</b> during dose delivery. This rotation may be determined by detecting the incremental movements of the dose setting member which are &#x201c;counted&#x201d; as the dose setting member is rotated during dose delivery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further details of the design and operation of an exemplary delivery device <b>10</b> may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,291,132, entitled Medication Dispensing Apparatus with Triple Screw Threads for Mechanical Advantage, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dose detection systems use a sensing component and a sensed component attached to members of the medication delivery device. The term &#x201c;attached&#x201d; encompasses any manner of securing the position of a component to another component or to a member of the medication delivery device such that they are operable as described herein. For example, a sensing component may be attached to a member of the medication delivery device by being directly positioned on, received within, integral with, or otherwise connected to, the member. Connections may include, for example, connections formed by frictional engagement, splines, a snap or press fit, sonic welding or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;directly attached&#x201d; is used to describe an attachment in which two components, or a component and a member, are physically secured together with no intermediate member, other than attachment components. An attachment component may comprise a fastener, adapter or other part of a fastening system, such as a compressible membrane interposed between the two components to facilitate the attachment. A &#x201c;direct attachment&#x201d; is distinguished from an attachment where the components/members are coupled by one or more intermediate functional members, such as the way dose dial member <b>32</b> is coupled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to dose button <b>56</b> by clutch <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; is used to denote that an indicated movement either can or cannot occur. For example, a first member is &#x201c;fixed rotationally&#x201d; with a second member if the two members are required to move together in rotation. In one aspect, a member may be &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; relative to another member functionally, rather than structurally. For example, a member may be pressed against another member such that the frictional engagement between the two members fixes them together rotationally, while the two members may not be fixed together absent the pressing of the first member.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Various sensor systems are contemplated herein. In general, the sensor systems comprise a sensing component and a sensed component. The term &#x201c;sensing component&#x201d; refers to any component which is able to detect the relative position or movement of the sensed component. The sensing component includes a sensing element, or &#x201c;sensor&#x201d;, along with associated electrical components to operate the sensing element. The &#x201c;sensed component&#x201d; is any component for which the sensing component is able to detect the position and/or movement of the sensed component relative to the sensing component. For the dose detection system, the sensed component rotates relative to the sensing component, which is able to detect the rotational movement of the sensed component. The sensing component may comprise one or more sensing elements, and the sensed component may comprise one or more sensed elements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sensor system produces outputs representative of the movement of the sensed component. A controller is operably connected to the sensor to receive the outputs. The controller is configured to determine from the outputs the amount of dose delivered by operation of the medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Illustratively, the dose detection system includes an electronics assembly suitable for operation of the sensor system as described herein. A controller is operably connected to the sensor system to receive outputs from the rotation sensor. The controller is configured to determine from the outputs the amount of dose delivered by operation of the medication delivery device. The controller may include conventional components such as a processor, power supply, memory, microcontrollers, etc. Alternatively, at least some components may be provided separately, such as by means of a computer, smart phone or other device. Means are then provided to operably connect the external controller components with the sensor system at appropriate times, such as by a wired or wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">An exemplary electronics assembly <b>76</b> comprises a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) having a plurality of electronic components. The electronics assembly comprises a sensor system including one or more sensors operatively communicating with a processor for receiving signals from the sensor representative of the sensed rotation. Electronics assembly <b>76</b> further includes a microcontroller unit (MCU) comprising at least one processing core and internal memory. The system includes a battery, illustratively a coin cell battery, for powering the components. The MCU includes control logic operative to perform the operations described herein, including determining a dose delivered by medication delivery device <b>10</b> based on a detected rotation of the dose setting member relative to the actuator. Many of the components of the electronics assembly may be contained in a compartment <b>78</b> located proximal of the dose button <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The MCU is operative to store the detected dose delivery in local memory (e.g., internal flash memory or on-board EEPROM). The MCU is further operative to wirelessly transmit a signal representative of the detected dose to a paired remote electronic device, such as a user's smartphone. Transmission may, for example, be over a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or other suitable short or long range wireless communication protocol. Illustratively, the BLE control logic and MCU are integrated on the same circuit.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further disclosed herein is a medication delivery device including a dose detection system operable to determine the amount of dose delivered based on relative rotation between a dose setting member and the device body. The dose detection system utilizes a dose setting member attached to the device body and rotatable relative to the device body about an axis of rotation during dose delivery. A sensed element is attached to and rotationally fixed with the dose setting member. An actuator is attached to the device body and is held against rotation relative to the device body during dose delivery. The sensed element thereby rotates relative to the actuator during dose delivery in relation to the amount of dose delivered.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The dose detection system involves detecting relative rotational movement between two members. With the extent of rotation having a known relationship to the amount of a delivered dose, the sensor system operates to detect the amount of angular movement from the start of a dose injection to the end of the dose injection. For example, a typical relationship for a pen injector is that an angular displacement of a dose setting member of 18&#xb0; is the equivalent of one unit of dose, although other angular relationships are also suitable. The sensor system is operable to determine the total angular displacement of a dose setting member during dose delivery. Thus, if the angular displacement is 90&#xb0;, then 5 units of dose have been delivered.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The angular displacement is determined by counting increments of dose amounts as the injection proceeds. For example, a sensing system may use a repeating pattern of a sensed element, such that each repetition is an indication of a predetermined degree of angular rotation. Conveniently, the pattern may be established such that each repetition corresponds to the minimum increment of dose that can be set with the medication delivery device.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sensor system components may be permanently or removably attached to the medication delivery device. In an illustrative embodiment, as least some of the dose detection system components are provided in the form of a module that is removably attached to the medication delivery device. This has the advantage of making these sensor components available for use on more than one pen injector.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sensor system detects during dose delivery the relative rotation of the sensed component, and therefore of the dose setting member, from which is determined the amount of a dose delivered by the medication delivery device. In an illustrative embodiment, a rotation sensor is attached, and rotationally fixed, to the actuator. The actuator does not rotate relative to the body of the medication delivery device during dose delivery. In this embodiment, a sensed component is attached, and rotationally fixed, to the dose setting member, which rotates relative to the actuator and the device body during dose delivery.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sensor system includes a rotation sensor attached to the actuator. The sensed element includes a cylindrical drive surface centered on a first axis of rotation corresponding to the axis of rotation of the dose setting member. The rotation sensor includes a driven member including a driven surface received by the drive member to move the driven member in response to rotation of the sensed element. Illustratively, the driven member is a circular component, such as a gear, which rotates in response to rotation of the drive member, which may for example comprise a drive gear. The rotation sensor is responsive to the movement of the driven member and generates signals corresponding to the amount of a dose delivery. A controller is responsive to the signals generated by the rotation sensor to determine the amount of dose delivery based on the detected rotation of the dose setting member relative to the actuator during dose delivery.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The drive and driven members may comprise anything which provides for transfer of the rotation of the sensed element to a detectable second movement. In a broad sense, the movement of the driven member may be in any manner, such as linear or rotational. Illustratively, the driven member rotates about a second axis of rotation, which may be the same as or different than the first axis of rotation of the dose setting member. In a particular aspect, the driven member rotates about a second axis of rotation that is identical with or parallel to the first axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drive surface of the sensed element includes surface features which couple with the driven surface of the driven member. By way of example, the coupling between the drive surface and the driven surface may be a frictional engagement between the two. In one aspect, the drive and driven members are gears comprising sets of intermeshed teeth.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown in diagrammatic form a dose detection system <b>80</b> including a module <b>82</b> useful in combination with a medication delivery device, such as device <b>10</b>. Module <b>82</b> carries a sensor system, shown generally at <b>84</b>, including a sensing component <b>85</b> comprising a rotation sensor <b>86</b> and other associated components such as a processor, memory, battery, etc. Module <b>82</b> may be provided as a separate component which may be removably attached to the actuator.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Dose detection module <b>82</b> includes a body <b>88</b> attached to dose button <b>56</b>. Body <b>88</b> illustratively includes an inner wall <b>90</b>, an outer wall <b>91</b>, and a top wall <b>92</b>, spanning over and sealing inner wall <b>90</b>. By way of example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> inner wall <b>90</b> is diagrammatically shown having inwardly-extending tabs <b>94</b> attaching module <b>82</b> to dose button <b>56</b>. Module <b>82</b> is thereby attached to dose button <b>56</b> such that pressing on the module delivers a set dose.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Dose detection module <b>82</b> may alternatively be attached to dose button <b>56</b> via any suitable fastening means, such as a snap or press fit, threaded interface, etc., provided that in one aspect module <b>82</b> may be removed from a first medication delivery device and thereafter attached to a second medication delivery device. The attachment may be at any location on dose button <b>56</b>, provided that dose button <b>56</b> is able to move any required amount axially relative to dose setting member <b>30</b>, as discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">During dose delivery, dose setting member <b>30</b> is free to rotate relative to dose button <b>56</b> and module <b>82</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, module <b>82</b> is rotationally fixed with dose button <b>56</b> and does not rotate during dose delivery. This may be provided structurally, such as with tabs <b>94</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, or by having mutually-facing splines or other surface features on the module body <b>88</b> and dose button <b>56</b> engage upon axial movement of module <b>82</b> relative to dose button <b>56</b>. In another embodiment, the distal pressing of the module provides a sufficient frictional engagement between module <b>82</b> and dose button <b>56</b> as to functionally cause the module <b>82</b> and dose button <b>56</b> to remain rotationally fixed together during dose delivery.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Top wall <b>92</b> is spaced apart from face <b>60</b> of dose button <b>56</b> and thereby provides with inner wall <b>90</b> a compartment <b>78</b> containing some or all of electronics assembly <b>76</b>.

Bottom wall <b>98</b> may be positioned to bear directly against face <b>60</b> of dose button <b>56</b>. Alternatively, bottom wall <b>98</b>, if present, may be spaced apart from dose button <b>56</b>, and other contacts between module <b>82</b> and dose button <b>56</b> may be used such that an axial force applied to module <b>82</b> is transferred to dose button <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is diagrammatically shown a dose detection system <b>80</b> further comprising a sensed element <b>100</b> attached to dose setting member <b>30</b>. As previously described, dose setting member <b>30</b> may comprise several separate components which are axially and rotationally fixed together. Accordingly, sensed element <b>100</b> may be attached to any component of dose setting member <b>30</b> which rotates relative to actuator <b>50</b> during dose delivery in proportion to the amount of the dose delivery. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, sensed element <b>100</b> is attached to skirt <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Sensed element <b>100</b> includes a cylindrical outer surface <b>102</b> comprising a drive surface <b>104</b>.

Dose setting member <b>30</b>, and particularly in this case skirt <b>42</b>, is rotatable relative to actuator <b>60</b> about a first axis of rotation <b>108</b>. First gear teeth <b>106</b> are radially-spaced about the first axis of rotation <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Actuator <b>60</b>, which includes dose button <b>56</b>, is mounted to delivery device <b>10</b> to operate in two modes. In a first operating mode, during dose setting, actuator <b>60</b> is axially and rotationally fixed with dose setting member <b>30</b>. In a second operating mode during dose delivery, actuator <b>60</b> is held against rotation relative to device body <b>11</b> and sensed element <b>100</b> and dose setting member <b>30</b> rotate relative to actuator <b>60</b> in relation to the amount of dose delivered.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Rotation sensor <b>86</b> is attached to actuator <b>60</b> during dose delivery. Rotation sensor <b>86</b> includes a contact component <b>110</b> including a driven surface <b>112</b> which operatively engages with drive surface <b>104</b>. As previously noted, the operative engagement between drive surface <b>104</b> and driven surface <b>112</b> may be provided in any manner which transfers the rotation of sensed element <b>100</b> to contact component <b>110</b>. This may comprise, for example, a frictional engagement between the drive and driven surfaces. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, drive surface <b>104</b> is shown as having first gear teeth <b>106</b> which in this case extend radially outward. A corresponding set of second gear teeth <b>114</b> are then preferably provided on the driven surface <b>112</b>. The second gear teeth <b>114</b> are illustratively provided as being radially-spaced about a second axis of rotation <b>116</b>, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is shown as being separate from the first axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Contact component <b>110</b> is used by rotation sensor <b>86</b> to detect the amount of rotation of dose setting member <b>30</b> during dose delivery, and may be provided in various ways. Generally, rotation sensor <b>86</b> includes a number of components which operate together to convert a detected rotation of contact component <b>110</b> into an amount of rotation of sensed element <b>100</b>, and therefore of dose setting member <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, rotation sensor <b>86</b> may comprise an encoder <b>118</b>. An example of an encoder useful in this manner is a micro encoder such as Miniature Optoelectronic Encoder Series MOT7 and available from Megatron. Such encoders are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another example, rotation sensor <b>86</b> may comprise a multi-turn potentiometer that uses variable resistance to determine data indicative of the amount of rotation of the dose setting member. Although the following description focuses on the components, arrangement, and orientation of the encoder <b>118</b>, the components, arrangement, and orientation may also be referenced for the multi-turn potentiometer, which includes a body, a shaft, a contact component, a drive gear comprising the second gear teeth. For example, the multi-turn potentiometer may be oriented with its body positioned proximal of the dose setting member <b>30</b>. The shaft of the multi-turn potentiometer may extend distally below from its body to position the contact component of the of the multi-turn potentiometer and the associated driven surface axially aligned with the dose setting member <b>30</b>. The sensed element may be provided as a cylindrical member attached to or formed integrally with the dose setting member <b>30</b>. The drive gear of the multi-turn potentiometer may be thereby positioned with its second gear teeth axially aligned with first gear teeth <b>106</b>. The multi-turn potentiometer may comprise, or be electrically connected to, a voltmeter or resistance sensor configured to measure an electrical resistance between two electrical leads that extend from the potentiometer. As rotation of the sensed element drives rotation of contact component <b>110</b> as previously described, the electrical resistance measured between said electrical leads may increase or decrease. For instance, as the contact component <b>110</b> rotates in a first direction, the electrical resistance may increase. Conversely, as the contact component <b>110</b> rotates in a second direction opposite to the first direction, the electrical resistance may decrease. By measuring the electrical resistance across the multi-turn potentiometer, a controller (which may be part of electronics assembly <b>76</b>) may determine an absolute rotational position of the multi-turn potentiometer. Alternatively, or additionally, by measuring a change in electrical resistance measured across the multi-turn potentiometer, the controller may determine an amount of rotation of contact component <b>110</b>, and therefore an amount of rotation of sensed element <b>100</b> and dose setting member <b>30</b>. Such multi-turn potentiometers are well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, encoder <b>118</b> includes a body <b>120</b>, shaft <b>122</b>, and contact component <b>110</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, contact component <b>110</b> comprises a drive gear <b>124</b> comprising second gear teeth <b>114</b> meshed with the first gear teeth <b>106</b> of sensed element <b>100</b>. Second gear teeth <b>114</b> are thereby operatively received by first gear teeth <b>106</b> such that second gear teeth <b>114</b> are driven in rotation about second axis of rotation <b>116</b> as first gear teeth rotate about first axis of rotation <b>108</b> during rotation of sensed element <b>100</b> relative to actuator <b>60</b> during dose delivery.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, illustratively encoder <b>118</b> is oriented with body <b>120</b> positioned proximal of actuator <b>50</b>, and particularly proximal of dose button <b>56</b>.

Driven gear <b>162</b> also includes apertures <b>170</b> radially spaced about axis <b>168</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Rotation sensor <b>161</b> further includes an LED <b>172</b> attached to compartment <b>78</b> proximally of driven gear <b>162</b> and positioned in axial alignment with apertures <b>170</b> as driven gear <b>162</b> rotates about axis <b>168</b>. An optical receiver <b>174</b> is attached to compartment <b>78</b> distally of driven gear <b>162</b> and is positioned in axial alignment with LED <b>172</b> to receive light emitted by LED <b>172</b> through apertures <b>170</b>. Rotation sensor <b>161</b> receives light at optical receiver <b>174</b> which is periodically interrupted as driven gear <b>162</b> rotates, and thereby detects the rotation of sensed element <b>150</b> during dose delivery. Rotation sensor <b>161</b> provides signals to a controller which determines the amount of dose delivered.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one aspect, the dose detection system is provided in a modular form. The use of a removably attached module is particularly adapted to use with a medication delivery device in which the actuator and/or the dose setting member include portions external to the medication delivery device housing. These external portions allow for direct attachment of the module containing the rotation sensor to the actuator, such as a dose button, and/or attachment of the sensed element to a dose setting member, such as a skirt, flange, or dose dial member, as described herein. Illustratively, both the module and the sensed element are removably attached to the medication delivery device. Alternatively, the sensed element is provided integral with the medication delivery device and the module is removably attached. The latter approach has the advantage that the more complex and expensive electronics, including the rotation sensor and controller, may be reused with different medication deliver devices. The sensed element may be integral with the medication delivery device as it typically may use relatively simpler, less expensive features. Alternatively, the dose detection system may be provided integrally formed within the medication delivery device and thus is not removed from the device. For example, what is shown and described as the module body <b>88</b>, instead forms the actuator body of the integrated medication delivery device. Further, what is shown and described as the dose button <b>56</b>, instead forms an internal body component of the actuator body of the integrated medication delivery device. Further, what is shown and described as the sensed component <b>100</b> attached to the skirt <b>42</b>, instead the sensed component <b>100</b> is attached to the flange <b>38</b> or dial member <b>32</b> of the dose setting member of the integrated medication delivery device. Any of the devices described herein may comprise any one of medications described herein, such as, for example, within the cartridge of the device.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
