The battery assembly includes a cover in order to protect the battery cells from damage and the environment. The cover protects the high voltage battery from water by tightly sealing the battery. The cover may be made of plastic. Usually, covers are manufactured using injection molding or stampings. In this manufacturing process, compression limiters for the covers may be built into the cover with minimal cost. In a vacuum formed cover, compression limiters may need to be manually pressed which adds cost and time for producing the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fasteners in a vehicle assembly may also include nuts. These nuts may need to be inserted into deep and narrow channels, such as within the battery assembly. Typically, nuts are inserted via hole in the bottom of the structure. This hole is vulnerable to water and may allow water to leak inside sealed assemblies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed embodiments include fasteners with integrated compression limiters. This allows the manufacturing process to not require an additional step of adding compression limiters.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore additional fasteners such as bolt and nut fasteners are present in assembly.
