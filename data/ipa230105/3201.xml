More particularly, it relates to thermal management of electric propulsion systems via embedded structures. Applications can include any electric propulsion system, including (but not limited to) gridded ion thrusters or Hall effect thrusters.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electric propulsion systems (e.g., Hall effect thrusters, gridded ion thrusters) use applied electric and magnetic fields to accelerate ions to extremely high velocities in order to generate thrust for a spacecraft. They are one of the most efficient forms of thrust available to modern spacecraft and are becoming an increasingly popular choice for propulsion systems for both commercial communications satellites and NASA missions. While electric propulsion systems are one of the most efficient forms of thrust for a spacecraft, they can use large amounts of power and produce a significant amount of waste heat. For example, the HERMeS Hall thruster in development for NASA PPE mission generates about 1.2 kW of thermal energy as losses out of its 12.5 kW total power. Likewise, the 1-kW MaSMI thruster invented and in development at JPL under a Strategic Initiative is entirely constrained in its size and compactness by the thermal design of its structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A large fraction of the waste energy in a thruster can be rejected directly to space by radiation, but a significant amount may still be absorbed by the thruster body and therefore may have to be rejected by the thruster thermal control system. In fact, the design and performance of electric propulsion systems, such as Hall thrusters, ranging in size from 1 kW to 100 kW is presently limited by shortcomings in performance of their thermal control systems. While smaller thrusters may suffer from the highest Watt/power density, power density for larger size thrusters may only be slightly decreased. In spite of such decrease in power density and due to their (considerably) higher raw/effective thermal power, thermal control of the larger size thrusters may be challenging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Teachings according to the present disclosure address challenges in thermal control of electric propulsion systems with an embedded thermal control solution that may be scaled to a size of a target propulsion system.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, an electric propulsion (EP) system is presented, comprising: a discharge chamber with a longitudinal extension according to an axial direction of the EP system; and a magnetic circuit for generation in the discharge chamber of a magnetic field according to a radial direction of the EP system, wherein the magnetic circuit comprises: a monolithic structure with an embedded oscillating heat pipe (OHP).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a method for thermal management of an electric propulsion (EP) system is presented, the method comprising: fabricating a magnetic circuit of the EP system as a monolithic structure; based on the fabricating, forming a continuous serpentine channel inside of the monolithic structure; filling the continuous serpentine channel with a working fluid; sealing the continuous serpentine channel, thereby embedding an oscillating heat pipe (OHP) in the magnetic circuit; forming a discharge chamber of the EP system within an annular region provided by the monolithic structure of the magnetic circuit, the magnetic circuit configured to generate a radial magnetic field inside of the discharge chamber; and based on the embedding of the OHP, thermally managing the EP system by increasing a thermal conductivity of the magnetic circuit.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated into and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate one or more embodiments of the present disclosure and, together with the description of example embodiments, serve to explain the principles and implementations of the disclosure.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the EP system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) may include an axial symmetry about a center axis (e.g., C<sub>L </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) about which (annular) elements of the EP system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) may be arranged. These include, for example, a discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) laterally bounded by outer wall (<b>104</b>) and inner wall (<b>106</b>) that may be made from insulating and/or conductive material. Within the inner space of the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>), propellant ions may be accelerated via electric fields (e.g., Hall effect or electric grid electrodes) produced in the EP system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>). Operation of the EP system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) may be further based on magnetic field lines produced within the inner space of the discharge chamber (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) according to methods and techniques known to a person skilled in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows further details of internal elements of the prior art EP system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) for an exemplary case of a Hall thruster.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a simplified cross-sectional schematic of the prior art EP system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> for an exemplary case of a Hall thruster. A Hall thruster typically uses a gas that can be ionized, such as Xenon, as the material that is accelerated by the thruster, which results in an equal and opposite acceleration experienced by the thruster (and the object/spacecraft to which it is attached). Xenon gas may be used because of its high atomic weight and low ionization potential. Other materials that can be used as propellants may include krypton, argon, iodine, bismuth, magnesium, or zinc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, within the inner space of the annular discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) bounded by walls (<b>104</b>, <b>106</b>), an anode/gas distributor (<b>110</b>) coupled to an inlet (<b>112</b>) for feeding of propellant gas may be provided. In conjunction with the anode/gas distributor (<b>110</b>), a cathode neutralizer (<b>115</b>) may be provided, so that a voltage applied between the anode (e.g., <b>110</b>) and the cathode (<b>115</b>) may generate free electrons within the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) that may be accelerated by an (axial) electric field formed in the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>). A magnetic circuit (<b>120</b>) made of a magnetic material (e.g., soft magnetic material) may connect an inner magnetic coil (<b>130</b>) and an outer magnetic coil (<b>135</b>) so to provide, within the inner space of the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>), a radial magnetic field that is perpendicular to the electric field produced between the anode (e.g., <b>112</b>) and the cathode (<b>115</b>). It should be noted that in some implementations, the cathode (<b>115</b>) may be arranged centrally within a region/cavity formed where element (<b>128</b>) is shown. Furthermore, in some implementations, the inner/outer magnetic coils (<b>130</b>, <b>135</b>) may include or be replaced with magnets, such as, for example, annular magnets to produce the radial magnetic field in (or about) the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>), a combination of the radial magnetic field and the axial electric field may cause the electrons to drift in azimuth thus forming a Hall current that may include circulating high-energy electrons. In turn, such high-energy electrons may bombard (e.g., collide with) propellant atoms input into the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) and accordingly ionize (a majority of) the propellant atoms to generate propellant ions that can accelerate axially out (as shown by large arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) of the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) under influence of the electric field produced between the anode (e.g., <b>112</b>) and the cathode (<b>115</b>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Because of interaction with discharge plasma produced within the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>), elements of the EP system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may be subjected to elevated temperatures, in a range of several hundreds of degrees centigrade (e.g., 300 to over 600 degrees). Such elevated temperatures may be higher at the center of the EP system where the discharge chamber (<b>102</b>) is located and may gradually decrease radially outwardly through thermal conduction paths provided by the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Due to lack of any dedicated cooling system, heat generated within the EP system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> should optimally be (thermally) conducted to exterior surfaces (e.g., <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) of the EP system and rejected into the vacuum of space via radiation from the exterior surfaces. However, corresponding thermal conduction paths may only be provided by some of the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, mainly elements (<b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) of the magnetic circuit (<b>120</b>) which may be fabricated from material that is selected, foremost, for its desired magnetic properties for operation in the EP system. A further hurdle to such passive cooling scheme is the interface between the various elements (<b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) of the magnetic circuit (<b>120</b>) which may include fastened/bolted interfaces that can affect thermal conduction between such elements.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Due to the inability to reject internal heat in a prior art EP system (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>), compromises in design of the system may be made which in turn may impact the performance and efficiency of the EP system. In general, an EP system may be forced to run at extremely high temperatures to accommodate the currently available methods of heat dissipation based purely on metal (thermal) conduction (and minimal rejection/radiation). However, this may cause a number of design problems, as the entire EP system may need to operate at temperatures that may be too high, or at the high end of supported temperatures, for some of the elements of the EP system. Thermal management of an EP system according to the present disclosure may allow foregoing of such prior art design compromises, thereby providing for a simplified EP system design with improved performance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Teachings according to the present disclosure may take advantage of newer methods for 3D printing (e.g., additive manufacturing) of magnetic material, including soft magnetic material (e.g., having an intrinsic coercivity of less than 1000 A/m), such as, for example, Hiperco, or other (e.g., soft magnetic iron) that may be used, for example, in the magnetic circuit (<b>120</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. As known to a person skilled in the art, Hiperco (trade name, Hiperco 50) is an iron-cobalt vanadium soft magnetic alloy that exhibits a high magnetic saturation (24 kilogauss) while maintaining low core loss as compared to, for example, electrical steel.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Teachings according to the present disclosure may use 3D printing to form/embed/integrate structures within the internal elements of an EP system, such as the EP system described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>/<b>1</b>B, that may form an integrated thermal management system of the EP system. Such integrated thermal management system according to the present disclosure may include an active and passive single-phase and/or multi-phase thermal management system formed by structures integrated into the internal elements of the EP system including, for example, into the elements (<b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>) of the magnetic circuit (<b>120</b>) described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.

In other words, any one or more of: the outer core (<b>124</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> with respective embedded (OHP) channel segments (<b>224</b>); the backplate (<b>122</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> with respective embedded (OHP) channel segments (<b>222</b>); or the inner core (<b>126</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> with respective embedded (OHP) channel segments (<b>226</b>), may be used (in combination) to provide a magnetic circuit of an EP system. In such configuration, such functional structures may be coupled/fixated to one another via any known in the art techniques, including, for example, fasteners, bolts and nuts, or weld joints.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, any of the embedded thermal management systems described above may be (thermally) coupled to a secondary, or more expansive, thermal management system which may reject heat to radiators that may be dedicated to the EP system. These radiators may be kept thermally isolated from the rest of the spacecraft structure, and allowed to operate at higher temperatures, thereby improving their efficiency due to an increased gradient between the heat rejection surfaces and space. For one example, one or more OHPs may be integrated throughout the heated portion of the EP system (e.g., functional elements <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) to create an embedded thermal management system with an effective thermal conductivity 10&#xd7; the base material, which then interacts with a secondary thermal management system to remove heat from a larger region (e.g., a radiator). Two such implementations of secondary thermal management systems are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows (simplified) perspective views of an EP system with embedded OHP according to the present teachings coupled to a secondary thermal management system that may include a cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>). The EP system may include any of the above-described embodiments for provision of embedded OHPs (e.g., channel segments <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>) in functional elements (e.g., <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>) of the EP system. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>) of the secondary thermal management system may surround (e.g., be wrapped around) the outer core (<b>124</b>) of the EP system so to extract the heat conducted to the outer core (<b>124</b>) and reject the heat through a corresponding subsystem that may include, for example, a radiator (not shown). Extraction of the heat from the outer core (<b>124</b>) may be provided via a (cold) working fluid, CF<sub>IN</sub>, that is fed through an inlet segment (<b>619</b><i>a</i>) of a pipe connected to the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>). As the working fluid, CF<sub>IN</sub>, circulates within inner channels (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>), it absorbs/extracts heat from the outer core (<b>124</b>) and outputs a corresponding (hot) working fluid, CF<sub>OUT</sub>, at an outlet segment (<b>619</b><i>b</i>) of the pipe connected to the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>). After cooling (e.g., at a remote radiator), the working fluid returns to the inlet segment (<b>619</b><i>a</i>) to continue the process of extracting heat from the EP system. According to other exemplary embodiments, heat extracted by the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>) may be routed to a waste heat recovery system (instead of a radiator) such as a thermoelectric or a Stirling engine. Waste heat could also be recovered and (partially or in full) rerouted to other parts of the spacecraft to keep such parts warm (e.g., chemical propulsion tank or avionics system).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A secondary thermal management system with operation analogous to the one described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In this case, instead of extraction of heat via a cylindrical heat exchanger (e.g., <b>609</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), extraction of the heat is provided via a baseplate (<b>709</b>) that is coupled to the backplate (<b>122</b>) of the EP system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Cold working fluid, CF<sub>IN</sub>, is fed into the baseplate (<b>709</b>) through the inlet (<b>719</b><i>a</i>) and output from the baseplate (<b>709</b>) as hot working fluid, CF<sub>OUT</sub>, through the outlet (<b>719</b><i>b</i>). It should be noted that features of the secondary thermal management systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may be combined into one secondary thermal management system that uses the cylindrical heat exchanger (<b>609</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in combination with the baseplate (<b>709</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to extract heat from the outer core (<b>124</b>) and backplate (<b>122</b>) of the EP system.

Such two-phase thermal management systems may include, for example, heat pipes, loop heat pipes, pumped multi-phase evaporators, OHPs, or other. For such two-phase thermal management systems, the integrated heat exchanger may function similar to an evaporator segment described above with reference to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B</figref>/<b>3</b>B/<b>4</b>B.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, teachings according to the present disclosure may use 3D printing to form/embed/integrate structures of a thermal management system within internal elements of an EP system, such structures including (internal) channel segments that join to form a continuous serpentine (meandering) channel that may extend through one or more of the functional elements of the EP system.
