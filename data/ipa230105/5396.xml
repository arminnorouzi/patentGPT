The design of the balls <b>7</b> facilitates the rotation of the rotating ring body <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a hanging lug <b>8</b> is fixedly connected to the outside of each of the rotating ring bodies <b>5</b>, and the hanging lug <b>8</b> is made of stainless steel. Due to the design of the hanging lugs <b>8</b>, it is convenient to hang the flag.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rotating ring body <b>5</b> is provided with a positioning hole <b>9</b>, and an inner wall of the positioning hole <b>9</b> is provided with an internal thread. The design of the positioning hole <b>9</b> facilitates the installation of screws for fixing the fixing sleeve <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a top of the flagpole <b>1</b> is fixedly connected with a limiting ball head <b>2</b>, and the limiting ball head <b>2</b> is made of stainless steel. The limiting ball head <b>2</b> is designed to, on the one hand, play an atractiverole, and to, on the other hand, play a limiting role.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an external thread <b>10</b> is arranged on the cover <b>4</b>, and the external thread <b>10</b> and the threaded fixing ring <b>6</b> are in threaded connection. The external thread <b>10</b> is designed to be in cooperation with the threaded fixing ring <b>6</b>, which can limit the rotating ring body <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The specific implementation process of the present disclosure is as follows: During use, the rotating ring body <b>5</b> sleeves the cover <b>4</b> on the fixing sleeve <b>3</b>; and the threaded fixing ring <b>6</b> is in threaded connection with the external thread <b>10</b> of the cover <b>4</b> until the threaded fixing ring <b>6</b> is in contact with the rotating ring body <b>5</b>; At this time, the balls <b>7</b> in the cover <b>4</b> are in contact with the threaded fixing ring <b>6</b> and the fixing sleeve <b>3</b>; and the cover <b>4</b> sleeves the flagpole <b>1</b>. The other cover <b>4</b> is mounted on the flagpole <b>1</b> in the same way. The flag needing to be hung is hung on the two hanging lugs. The fixing sleeve <b>3</b> located above slides to the top of the flagpole <b>1</b> and is screwed in the positioning hole <b>9</b> with a screw; furthermore, a tail end of the screw resists against a surface of the flagpole <b>1</b>; and in this way, the fixing sleeve <b>3</b> and the components on the fixing sleeve <b>3</b> are fixed. The other fixing sleeve <b>3</b> is fixed on the flagpole <b>1</b> in the same way. At this time, the flag is fixed. When a wind direction changes, the flag will drive the two rotating ring bodies <b>5</b> to rotate outside the covers <b>4</b>, so that the flag is always kept in a direction consistent with the wind direction. Therefore, the phenomenon that the flag wraps around the flagpole <b>1</b> is avoided.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the embodiments of the present disclosure have been shown and described, it will be understood that those of ordinary skill in the art can make various changes, modifications, substitutions and transformations to these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the present disclosure, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
