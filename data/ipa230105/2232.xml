The insulating GO can be conveniently converted to its conductive form of reduced GO (r-GO, a.k.a., chemical modified graphene) through many thermal, chemical and light-based methods. Therefore, GO has been used as a water processible precursor to create bulk forms of graphene-based materials including fibers, films, foams, gels and densified solids. Among them, densified graphene monoliths or powders, with largely isotropically packed sheets, have been shown to have interesting chemical, mechanical and electrochemical properties. Such isotropic graphene solids are typically made by slow drying of the corresponding graphene hydrogels obtained by hydrothermal treatments of GO dispersion. The network of the sheets in the hydrogel are crumpled and densely packed under capillary compression to yield the final high-density solids.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the hydrothermal gelation process, GO dispersion of relatively high concentration is heated well over the boiling point of water to trigger the deoxygenation reaction of GO. Since the resulting reduced GO sheets are less dispersible in water, they gradually aggregate and assemble into a network, forming a hydrogel during undisturbed cooling. Since the temperatures typically used to induce the hydrothermal sol-gel transition occurs well above the boiling point of water, a sealed pressurized vessel is needed to contain the reaction, constraining the synthesis to batch processing and making it harder to scale up. Larger reaction vessels do yield larger hydrogels, which, however, are prone to collapse due to its own weight, and non-uniform drying can lead to cracking and inhomogeneous microstructures.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Provided are methods for synthesizing a graphene gel.

In embodiments, such a method comprises flowing a graphene oxide composition comprising graphene oxide (GO) and a solvent through a reaction chamber under conditions to deoxygenate the graphene oxide and induce gelation to form a graphene gel suspended in the solvent. The method may further comprise collecting the graphene gel from the reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The GO of the GO composition is in the form of a plurality of thin, flexible sheets. Each sheet may comprise from one to several (e.g., 3-10) monolayers of GO. Thus, the thickness of the sheets may be less than about 10 nm, less than about 5 nm, less than about 1 nm, or in the range of from a monolayer to about 10 nm or a monolayer to about 1 nm. The lateral dimensions of the sheets are not particularly limited, but generally are significantly greater than the thickness, e.g., on the order of microns, e.g., 1 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m, 50 &#x3bc;m, 100 &#x3bc;m, providing an aspect ratio of at least &#x3e;1000. Known methods may be used to form the GO, e.g., chemical exfoliation of a graphite powder followed by mechanical exfoliation. Commercial sources of GO may be used. The sheets are generally dispersed throughout the GO composition such that the GO composition may be considered to be a colloidal dispersion of the GO in the solvent.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The solvent of the GO composition is a liquid other than water, the liquid capable of forming the colloidal dispersion noted above. The solvent is also a liquid having a relatively high boiling point, e.g., higher than the boiling point of pure water (100&#xb0; C.). The boiling point of the solvent may be higher than a reaction temperature being used in the method to achieve the deoxygenation and gelation. The boiling point may be at least 150&#xb0; C., at least 160&#xb0; C., at least 170&#xb0; C., at least 180&#xb0; C., at least 190&#xb0; C., or in a range of from 150&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C. The solvent is generally an organic compound, e.g., an alcohol. The solvent may be a glycol, e.g., ethylene glycol (EG).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The GO composition may include other components. In embodiments, the GO composition comprises a CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant, a chemical compound capable of reacting with CO<sub>2 </sub>in the GO composition as the CO<sub>2 </sub>is released during the deoxygenation of the GO. In embodiments, the CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant is a base, e.g., NaOH, which reacts with released CO<sub>2 </sub>to form Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The GO composition may include an additional liquid, e.g., water. The GO composition may include an additive such as a polymer (e.g., polyaniline nanofibers), a carbon-based material (e.g., carbon black, carbon nanotubes, etc.), particles (or nanoparticles) of silicon or metal or an oxide thereof, biomass. Any additive may be used in order to tune the properties of the synthesized graphene gel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various amounts of the GO, the solvent, the CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant, the additional liquid, and the additive may be used. For example, the GO may be present in the GO composition at a concentration in a range of from 0.1 mg/mL to 25 mg/mL, from 0.5 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL, or from 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. Amounts of the CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant may be used so as to control CO<sub>2 </sub>bubble formation and to facilitate continuous, rather than broken/interrupted, synthesis of the graphene gel as described in the Example, below. The additional liquid may be used in an amount of from 1 volume % to 10 volume % (as compared to the total volume of the GO composition). This includes from 2 volume % to 8 volume % and from 3 volume % to 6 volume %. The additive may be used at a concentration within the ranges described above for the GO. The balance of the GO composition is generally the solvent. Other illustrative amounts of the components of the GO composition are provided in the Example, below.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the GO composition consists of the GO, the solvent (e.g., ethylene glycol), the CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant (e.g., NaOH), optionally, the additional liquid (e.g., water), and optionally, the additive (e.g., one or more of polyaniline nanofibers, carbon black, nickel particles). In embodiments, the GO composition consists of the GO, the solvent, the CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant, the additional liquid, and optionally, the additive. In any of the embodiments of the GO composition described herein, a single type of each component (solvent, CO<sub>2 </sub>sequestrant, additional liquid, and additive) may be used or multiple, different types of each component may be used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As noted above, the present methods are carried out by flowing the GO composition through the reaction chamber. Any reactor system configured to deliver the GO composition as a flowing stream and to collect the graphene gel formed in the flowing stream may be used. Such a reactor system may be referred to as a &#x201c;continuous flow reactor system.&#x201d; Continuous flow reactor systems are distinguished from batch reactor systems. An illustrative continuous flow reactor system <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The system <b>100</b> includes a reaction chamber, which, in this embodiment, is a tube <b>102</b>. A portion of the tube <b>102</b> is immersed in a heat bath <b>104</b> so as to achieve a desired reaction temperature. The system <b>100</b> also includes a syringe <b>108</b> configured to flow a GO composition <b>110</b> through the tube <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the syringe <b>108</b> also functions as the source of the GO composition <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> further includes a chamber <b>112</b> configured to collect the graphene gel <b>114</b> as it is being synthesized. In this embodiment, the chamber <b>112</b> is filled with liquid (e.g., water) for rinsing and solvent exchange. Other components may be used in the system <b>100</b>, e.g., a furnace rather than a heat bath. Other components may be included in the system <b>100</b>, e.g., a mechanical pump, additional sources to introduce additives into the flowing stream. However, a notable feature of the system <b>100</b> is that the reaction chamber (the tube <b>102</b>) is not a pressurized reaction chamber, i.e., the method is carried out under atmospheric pressure. (This does not preclude some amount of pressure on the GO composition from the syringe pump.)</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">By &#x201c;conditions,&#x201d; as that term is used with respect to the present methods, can refer to the flow rate of the GO composition (which affects the reaction time), the dimensions of the reaction chamber (e.g., the inner diameter and length of the tube <b>102</b> of the reaction chamber (which also affects the reaction time)), and the reaction temperature. These conditions are generally adjusted to facilitate the deoxygenation of the GO and gelation. Deoxygenation refers to the removal of at least some of the oxygen-containing groups in the GO (e.g., hydroxyl groups, epoxy groups, carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, carboxylic groups, or combinations thereof). In the present methods, these deoxygenation reactions are induced by heat, rather than by using chemical reductants (although in embodiments, chemical reductants may be used). Gelation refers to the aggregation and assembly of the deoxygenated GO sheets to form a non-fluid network suspended in the solvent. This &#x201c;non-fluid network&#x201d; of deoxygenated GO sheets is the synthesized graphene gel. This process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a portion of the tube <b>102</b> immersed in the heat bath <b>104</b> through which the GO composition <b>110</b> is being flowed. As the GO composition <b>110</b> is flowed through the tube <b>102</b>, heat from the heat bath <b>104</b> induces deoxygenation of the GO and gelation to form the graphene gel <b>114</b>. Syneresis accompanies the gelation so that the graphene gel <b>114</b> contracts from inner surfaces of the tube <b>102</b> to become suspended therein. This suspension allows the graphene gel to also be flowed through the reaction chamber and ultimately, to be collected therefrom.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As noted above, the conditions are generally adjusted to facilitate the GO deoxygenation and gelation. Illustrative flow rates of the GO composition include those in the range of from 10 mL/hr to 100 mL/hr, from 20 mL/hr to 80 mL/hr, and from 30 mL/hr to 60 mL/hr. Illustrative tube inner diameters include those in the range of from 2 mm to 15 mm, from 3 mm to 14 mm, and from 3 mm to 10 mm. Illustrative tube lengths include those in the range of from 0.5 m to 10 m, from 1 m to 10 m, and from 1 m to 5 m. Illustrative reaction times (which depend upon flow rate and tube dimensions) include those in the range of from 1 minute to about 120 minutes, from 10 minutes to 80 minutes, and from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. Illustrative reaction temperatures include those in a range of from 120&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., from 130&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., from 140&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. As noted above, a feature of the present methods that the deoxygenation and gelation do not require pressurized conditions (i.e., pressure greater than atmospheric pressure). In other words, the conditions under which the present methods may be carried out include the use of atmospheric pressure. (As noted above, this does not preclude some amount of pressure on the GO composition from pumping the GO composition through the reaction chamber.)</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, collection of the synthesized graphene gel may involve expulsion or extrusion of the graphene gel from the reaction chamber into a suitable container. Expelled solvent/other components of the GO composition may also be collected as part of this step. Solvent exchange and/or rinsing may be carried out on the collected graphene gel, as further described in the Example below. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the graphene gel generally has a shape corresponding to the interior shape of the reaction chamber in which it was synthesized (in this embodiment, the graphene gel is in the form of an elongated, flexible rope). The dimensions of the graphene gel are also similar (but generally smaller due to syneresis) to the interior dimensions of the reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present methods may further comprise removing solvent (or other liquid) from the graphene gel. The removed solvent/liquid may be that which was used in the GO composition and/or that which was used in a subsequent solvent exchange/rinsing step. Solvent removal may be carried out in air at room temperature (or an elevated temperature) for a period of time. Solvent removal may be carried out using freeze-drying. As described in the Example, below, these two different solvent removal processes impart the dried graphene gel with different structural characteristics. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref>.) The dried graphene gel may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;xerogel&#x201d; or an &#x201c;aerogel.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Dried graphene gels (i.e., xerogels or aerogels) may be subjected to further processing such as grinding, purification, annealing, etc., as described in the Example, below. Dried graphene gels may be used in a variety of applications, including, but not limited to electrodes, electrolytes, and/or catalysts in devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As noted above, the present methods involve the deoxygenation of GO to remove at least some oxygen-containing groups. Thus, the graphene gel will be characterized by a higher carbon-to-oxygen ratio than the GO from which the graphene gel is derived. However, the deoxygenation need not be complete. The graphene gel may be characterized by a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of, e.g., at least 2, at least 2.5, at least 3.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Introduction</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersions has been used to create graphene (a.k.a., reduced GO) hydrogels, which dry to yield high density graphene monoliths and powders for use in electrochemical energy storage applications. This Example demonstrates an alternative glycol-thermal route that allows the preparation of a graphene gel at around 150&#xb0; C., which is below the boiling point of ethylene glycol and eliminates the need for a sealed pressurized reaction vessel. In the present methods, flow synthesis can be achieved by flowing a GO dispersion in ethylene glycol through a Teflon tube immersed in a pre-heated oil bath for continuous production of a graphene gel, which, upon drying, shrinks to yield a densified graphene solid.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Experimental Methods</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Low temperature hydrogel formation: 80 ml of a 0.1 wt. % GO solution was placed in a 100 ml beaker. The beaker was then placed in an oven at 98&#xb0; C. and a plastic cover was placed on top. It was left for 24 hours, after which a hydrogel had formed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Synthesis of glycol-gel in a vial: A GO dispersion of 2 mg ml<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in ethylene glycol was prepared, which contained 4-5% of water. 18 ml of this dispersion was added into a glass scintillation vial, which was suspended in a silicon oil bath heated to 150&#xb0; C. No stirring was applied. Time lapse photos were taken during the gelation process.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Continuous flow synthesis: Optimized syntheses used a 6 mg ml<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>of GO dispersion in ethylene glycol containing 4% of water, to which 0.1 M NaOH was added immediately before extrusion. This solution was then collected in a 60 ml syringe, which was attached to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube 3.2 mm in diameter. The tube was coiled 3 times for a total length of approximately 1.25 m and placed in a silicon oil bath set to 150&#xb0; C. The solution was pumped through the tube using a syringe pump set to a rate of 45 ml hr<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which corresponds to a linear flow rate of &#x2dc;568 cm h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and an overall traveling time of about 22 minutes through the entire heated length of the tube. The extruded gel was collected in a 2 L glass beaker filled with DI water. To purge the remaining reduced graphene oxide gel in the tube after the syringe had been emptied, a new syringe filled with pure ethylene glycol was placed into the pump.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Solvent exchange: The 2 L beaker in which the glycol-gel had been extruded was let to sit in an oven at 60&#xb0; C. for 4 hours before replenishing water. This cycle was usually repeated 4 times over a two-day period. After the final rinse, the gel dried at room temperature to generate a xerogel. This xerogel was then be ground into powders.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Sulfuric acid soak: To accelerate the removal of excess sodium carbonate salt, the xerogel powders were soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid in an oven at 60&#xb0; C. overnight, followed by rinsing with by DI water before filtration and drying.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Supercapacitor assembly and testing: The purified xerogel powder was then mixed with a 10:1:1 ratio by mass of xerogel powder, Super P, and PTFE binder, respectively. They were all mixed in a mortar and pestle and transferred to a PTFE slab where the mixture was rolled out into single film. Once the film was dried, it was transferred to a nickel foam electrode and pressed at 1 MPa. The electrode was then placed with a symmetric pair in a coin cell and a fine pore filter paper was used as a separation membrane. To this, 6 M KOH electrolyte was added, and the coin cell was pressed at 1 MPa.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The coin cell was then placed in NEWARE battery cell tester, where it was run at 0.1 A/g, 0.3 A/g, 0.5 A/g, 1 A/g, back to 0.1 A/g for 10 cycles each.

The gel can be directly dried to form compact and densified graphenic solid. To make clear that high pressure is not essential to the formation of a gel, a GO/water solution (1 mg ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) was heated at 98&#xb0; C. with a plastic cap covering the container, loosely, to avoid complete evaporation of water. A soft gel indeed formed successfully after 24 hours, demonstrating that, in fact, high pressure is not needed for gel formation. However, the resulting gel was very brittle and weak, making subsequent handling and processing difficult suggesting that a high temperature, rather than high pressure, facilitates obtaining a stiff gel within a short time frame. Therefore, experiments were conducted using ethylene glycol (EG) as a solvent for formation of a graphene gel at ambient pressure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">First, it was tested whether a graphene gel could be produced in EG. A 20 ml scintillation vial filled with 0.1 wt. % GO/EG solution was placed into a pre-heated silicon oil bath (150&#xb0; C.), to allow for direct visual observation throughout the solvothermal process. Gelation indeed occurred and was accompanied by syneresis, leading to the suspension of a slightly shrunken gel in the expelled solvent. In the experiment, the vial was intentionally uncapped, demonstrating that high pressure was not necessary for gel formation.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">Next, a flow synthesis scheme was designed to form a graphene gel. The system <b>100</b> used is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and has been described above. Since the sol-gel transition is accompanied by a drastic increase of viscosity, it was initially expected that flow synthesis of gel in a tube may not be possible. It was initially expected that the drag on the gel by the inner wall of the tube would not only increase the resistance but also continuously deform and damage the gel. However, surprisingly, the graphene glycol-gel underwent sufficient syneresis so that the gel remained levitated/suspended and was able to flow drag-free inside the tube, akin to a hyperloop-train inside a tunnel. A schematic of this levitation/suspension is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. This levitation/suspension allowed for the continuous and smooth extrusion of a graphene gel without getting stuck by friction within the tube. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube was used as the reaction chamber due to its thermal and chemical stability, as well as low surface energy. Depending on the inner diameter of the tube being used for the continuous flow synthesis, graphene gels having different diameters were formed from tubes having inner diameters in a range from 3.2 to 12.7 mm. The following discussion, however, refers to gels having a diameter of 3.2 mm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, a 6 mg ml<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>GO/EG solution was injected into a PTFE tubing at a rate of 45 ml hr<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>controlled by a syringe pump (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). The coiled tubing was completely submerged into a silicon oil heating bath maintained at 150&#xb0; C., resulting in a residence time of the GO of approximately 22 minutes. Thermal deoxygenation of GO and gelation of the sheets happened quickly, with the color changing from brown to black. However, along with the formation of the gel, the generated gas grew into large bubbles at the sol-gel transition interface. These bubbles eventually coalesced to bisect the tube, breaking the glycol-gel from the GO solution. Once the gel was separated, the pressure from the trapped gas pocket rapidly ejected the as-formed glycol-gel out of the tube (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). The gaseous byproducts had insufficient solubility in the solvent. To address this issue, the continuous extrusion of gels can be achieved by sequestrating carbon dioxide, which is the major component of the released gas, using sodium hydroxide to neutralize and convert any generated carbon dioxide to sodium carbonate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). The salt, together with the ethylene glycol, can be removed by a solvent exchange process with DI water. The solvent exchange was repeated four times over a forty-eight-hour period.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">The obtained graphene gels can be dried by freeze-drying to maintain microstructure, or by air drying to yield a densified xerogel after solvent exchange with water. As shown in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the as-extruded graphene gel showed a low-density foam structure. Freeze-drying resulted in densification by uniaxial compression, yielding a dense solid with anisotropic lamellar microstructure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Slow drying of the graphene gel in air subjected the sheets to a largely isotropic compressive force field, and the resulting microstructure of the xerogel was made of densely yet disorderedly packed crumpled sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C-<b>2</b>D</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the uniaxially compressed, freeze-dried xerogel and the isotropically compressed, air dried xerogel. The lack of long-range stacking order in the air-dried graphene xerogel was confirmed by the significantly weaker (002) peak as compared to the freeze-dried xerogel. The XRD patterns of the air dried xerogel indicates that the xerogel may be used as a building block for making larger bulk graphenic materials.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">As noted above, a substantial amount of the by-products in the graphene gels may be removed by solvent exchange; however, some sodium carbonate may remain. Purification can be accelerated by soaking the xerogel in concentrated sulfuric acid overnight. Concentrated sulfuric acid, which is used in the synthesis of GO, intercalates the tightly packed graphene sheets and swells the xerogel, removing the excess sodium carbonate at the same time. However, extended solvent exchange with DI water can also achieve a high purity of the xerogel. After a thorough dilution and rinse, the purified xerogel can be dried at room temperature to achieve a density of 1.63&#xb1;0.08 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">The chemical composition (including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen) of the xerogel powder before and after purification was evaluated by combustion-based elemental analysis. The sulfur content was found to be negligible, indicating thorough removal of sulfuric acid by the final rinsing step. The atom ratio of carbon to oxygen was approximately 2.8, indicating that the GO was not highly reduced during extrusion. This may be attributed to the short time spent in the heated silicon oil bath. However, despite the low reduction, experiments showed that the xerogel still performed well as an electrode material for supercapacitors. If it was further annealed (e.g., at 350&#xb0; C. for 1 hour), the conductivity of the xerogel powder was further improved (from 34 Sm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 49 Sm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), contributing to an enhancement in performance. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the annealed xerogel powder exhibited a gravimetric capacitance of 198 F g<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at a current density of 0.1 A g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, and maintained a respectable value at higher current densities. Based on the xerogel powder's density of 1.52&#xb1;0.07 g cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, the volumetric capacitance was estimated to be around 300 F cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The gravimetric and volumetric capacitances are comparable to hydrothermal graphene hydrogels, showing that densified graphene powders may be used as materials for developing supercapacitors with a high energy density. In addition, the quasi-rectangular cyclic voltammetry curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy obtained showed good capacitive behavior and low resistance of the graphene xerogel powders.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0046">The shrinkage of the graphene gel during glycol-thermal treatment simultaneously expelled excess solvent and suspended the gel. This enabled a flow synthesis of graphene glycol-gels using high boiling point solvents such as EG without the need to seal and pressurize the reaction vessel. Syneresis during the sol-gel transition of GO in a heated tube reactor allowed continuous extrusion of graphene glycol-gel product. Sodium hydroxide can be added to the dispersion to neutralize and capture released CO<sub>2 </sub>in the reaction. After solvent exchange to replace EG and remove the salt byproducts, the graphene gel was dried in air to yield densified xerogel, which was made of densely and yet disorderly packed crumpled sheets. This flow synthesis method may be extended to prepare a number of GO-based multifunctional composite materials, leveraging GO's surfactant-like properties to co-disperse other materials such as carbon nanomaterials, conductive polymers, biomass, silicon, metal and oxide nanoparticles, and many others. This was shown in other experiments involving addition of polyaniline nanofibers, nickel, and carbon black (separately) in the GO/EG dispersion followed by extrusion. The xerogel powders may be used for electrochemical energy storage applications or as a building block for making larger bulk graphenic glass materials.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">Additional information may be found in U.S. Ser.
