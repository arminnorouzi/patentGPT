A heart beat is initiated in the SA node, which acts as the natural &#x201c;pacemaker&#x201d; of the heart. An electrical impulse arising from the SA node causes the atrial myocardium to contract. The signal is conducted to the ventricles via the AV node which inherently delays the conduction to allow the atria to stop contracting before the ventricles begin contracting thereby providing proper AV synchrony. The electrical impulse is conducted from the AV node to the ventricular myocardium via the bundle of His, bundle branches and Purkinje fibers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patients with a conduction system abnormality, e.g., poor AV node conduction or poor SA node function, may receive a pacemaker to restore a more normal heart rhythm and atrioventricular synchrony. Dual chamber pacemakers are available which include a transvenous atrial lead carrying electrodes which are placed in the right atrium and a transvenous ventricular lead carrying electrodes that are placed in the right ventricle via the right atrium. The pacemaker itself is generally implanted in a subcutaneous pocket with the transvenous leads tunneled to the subcutaneous pocket. A dual chamber pacemaker senses atrial electrical signals and ventricular electrical signals and can provide both atrial pacing and ventricular pacing as needed to promote a normal heart rhythm and AV synchrony.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Intracardiac pacemakers have been introduced or proposed for implantation entirely within a patient's heart, eliminating the need for transvenous leads which can be a source of infection or other complications. An intracardiac pacemaker may provide sensing and pacing within a single chamber of the patient's heart. In some patient's single chamber pacing and sensing may adequately address the patient's needs, however single chamber pacing and sensing may not fully address the cardiac conduction disease or abnormalities in all patients. Dual chamber sensing and/or pacing functions may be required to restore a more normal heart rhythm.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, the disclosure is directed to an intracardiac pacemaker. The intracardiac pacemaker includes multiple electrodes coupled to an insulative distal member of the pacemaker housing. In some examples, at least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode is coupled directly to the insulative distal member and a tissue piercing electrode extends away from the insulative distal member. The non-tissue piercing cathode electrode may be used to sense electrical signals from and deliver electrical pulses to adjacent cardiac tissue. The tissue piercing electrode may be used to sense electrical signals from and deliver electrical pulses to cardiac tissue spaced apart from the adjacent cardiac tissue (i.e., the cardiac tissue adjacent to the non-tissue piercing cathode electrode).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example, the disclosure provides a pacemaker including a housing having a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal sidewall extending from the proximal end to the distal end and a therapy delivery circuit enclosed by the housing for generating pacing pulses for delivery to a patient's heart. The pacemaker includes an anode electrode defined by an electrically conductive portion of the housing and an electrically insulative distal member coupled to the housing distal end. At least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode is coupled directly to the insulative distal member and electrically coupled to the therapy delivery circuit for delivering a first portion of the generated pacing pulses via a first pacing electrode vector including the at least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode and the anode electrode. A tissue piercing electrode extends away from the housing distal end for delivering a second portion of the generated pacing pulses.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, the disclosure provides a pacemaker system including a pacemaker having a housing with a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal sidewall extending from the proximal end to the distal end. A therapy delivery circuit is enclosed by the housing for generating pacing pulses for delivery to a patient's heart. An anode electrode is defined by an electrically conductive portion of the housing. An electrically insulative distal member is coupled to the housing distal end. At least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode is coupled directly to the insulative distal member and electrically coupled to the therapy delivery circuit for delivering at least a portion of the generated pacing pulses via a pacing electrode vector including the at least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode and the anode electrode. A tissue piercing electrode includes an electrically insulated shaft extending from a distal shaft end to a proximal shaft end that is coupled to the housing distal end and a tip electrode at the distal shaft end. The pacemaker further includes a delivery tool interface member extending from the housing proximal end for receiving a delivery tool for advancing the tip electrode into a first heart chamber tissue for pacing a first heart chamber and advancing the at least one non-tissue piercing cathode along a second heart chamber tissue for pacing a second heart chamber.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, the disclosure provides a method performed by a pacemaker having a housing enclosing a therapy delivery circuit for generating a plurality of pacing pulses. The method includes delivering a first portion of the pacing pulses via at least one non-tissue piercing cathode electrode directly coupled to an insulative distal member coupled to a distal end of the housing to pace a first heart chamber and delivering a second portion of the pacing pulses via a tissue-piercing distal electrode having a cathode tip electrode extending away from the housing distal end to pace a second heart chamber different than the first heart chamber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This summary is intended to provide an overview of the subject matter described in this disclosure.

Pacemaker <b>10</b> is shown implanted in the right atrium (RA) of the patient's heart <b>8</b> in a target implant region <b>4</b>. Pacemaker <b>10</b> includes a fixation member <b>20</b> that anchors a distal end of the pacemaker against the atrial endocardium in the target implant region <b>4</b>. The target implant region <b>4</b> may lie between the Bundle of His <b>5</b> and the coronary sinus <b>6</b> and may be adjacent the tricuspid valve <b>3</b>. Pacemaker <b>10</b> may be a leadless pacemaker including a dart electrode <b>12</b> having a straight shaft extending from the distal end of the pacemaker <b>10</b>, through the atrial myocardium and the central fibrous body, and into the ventricular myocardium <b>14</b> or along the ventricular septum, without perforating entirely through the ventricular endocardial or epicardial surfaces. The dart electrode <b>12</b> carries an electrode at the distal end of the shaft for positioning the electrode within the ventricular myocardium for sensing ventricular signals and delivering ventricular pacing pulses. In some examples, the electrode at the distal end of the shaft is a cathode electrode provided for use in a bipolar pacing and sensing electrode pair. While a particular implant region <b>4</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to enable an electrode of dart electrode <b>12</b> to be positioned in the ventricular myocardium, it is recognized that a pacemaker having the aspects disclosed herein may be implanted at other locations for dual chamber pacing, single chamber pacing with dual chamber sensing, single chamber pacing and/or sensing, or other clinical applications as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged conceptual diagram of dual chamber intracardiac pacemaker <b>10</b> and anatomical structures of the patient's heart <b>8</b>. Intracardiac pacemaker <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>30</b> that defines a hermetically sealed internal cavity in which internal components of pacemaker <b>10</b> reside, such as a sensing circuit, therapy delivery circuit, control circuit, memory, telemetry circuit, other optional sensors, and a power source as generally described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> below. The housing <b>30</b> may be formed from an electrically conductive material including titanium or titanium alloy, stainless steel, MP35N (a non-magnetic nickel-cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy), platinum alloy or other bio-compatible metal or metal alloy. In other examples, housing <b>30</b> is formed from a non-conductive material including ceramic, glass, sapphire, silicone, polyurethane, epoxy, acetyl co-polymer plastics, polyether ether ketone (PEEK), a liquid crystal polymer, or other biocompatible polymer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Housing <b>30</b> extends between a distal end <b>32</b> and proximal end <b>34</b> and is generally cylindrical in the examples presented herein to facilitate catheter delivery, but housing <b>30</b> may be prismatic or other shapes in other examples. Housing <b>30</b> may include a delivery tool interface member <b>26</b>, e.g., at the proximal end <b>34</b>, for engaging with a delivery tool during implantation of pacemaker <b>10</b>. One example of a delivery tool that may be used for delivering pacemaker <b>10</b> to an implant site is described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">All or a portion of housing <b>30</b> may function as an electrode during pacing and/or sensing. In the example shown, a housing-based electrode <b>24</b> is shown to circumscribe a proximal portion of housing <b>30</b>. When housing <b>30</b> is formed from an electrically conductive material, such as a titanium alloy or other examples listed above, portions of housing <b>30</b> may be electrically insulated by a non-conductive material, such as a coating of parylene, polyurethane, silicone, epoxy or other biocompatible polymer, leaving one or more discrete areas of conductive material exposed to define proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b>. When housing <b>30</b> is formed from a non-conductive material, such as a ceramic, glass or polymer material, an electrically-conductive coating or layer, such as a titanium, platinum, stainless steel, or alloys thereof, may be applied to one or more discrete areas of housing <b>30</b> to form proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b>. In other examples, proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> may be a component, such as a ring electrode, that is mounted or assembled onto housing <b>30</b>. Proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> may be electrically coupled to internal circuitry of pacemaker <b>10</b>, e.g., via electrically-conductive housing <b>30</b> or an electrical conductor when housing <b>30</b> is a non-conductive material. In the example shown, proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> is located nearer to housing proximal end <b>34</b> than housing distal end <b>32</b> and is therefore referred to as a &#x201c;proximal housing-based electrode&#x201d; <b>24</b>. In other examples, however, a housing-based electrode <b>24</b> may be located at other positions along housing <b>30</b>, e.g., relatively more distally than the position shown.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At distal end <b>32</b>, pacemaker <b>10</b> includes a distal fixation and electrode assembly <b>36</b> including fixation member <b>20</b> and a dart electrode <b>12</b> including shaft <b>40</b> extending distally away from housing distal end <b>32</b> and carrying tip electrode <b>42</b> carried at or near the free, distal end of shaft <b>40</b>. Tip electrode <b>42</b> may have a conical or hemi-spherical distal tip with a relatively narrow tip diameter, e.g., less than <b>1</b> mm, for penetrating into and through tissue layers without requiring a sharpened tip or needle-like tip having sharpened or beveled edges that might otherwise produce a cutting action that could lead to lateral displacement of the tip electrode <b>42</b> and undesired tissue trauma.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Shaft <b>40</b> of dart electrode <b>12</b> is a normally straight member and may be rigid in some examples. In other examples, shaft <b>40</b> is relatively stiff possessing limited flexibility in lateral directions. Shaft <b>40</b> may be non-rigid to allow some lateral flexing with heart motion. However, in a relaxed state, when not subjected to any external forces, shaft <b>40</b> maintains a straight position as shown to hold tip electrode <b>42</b> spaced apart from housing distal end <b>32</b> at least at the height <b>47</b> of shaft <b>40</b>. Dart electrode <b>12</b> is configured to pierce through one or more tissue layers to position tip electrode <b>42</b> within a desired tissue layer, e.g., the ventricular myocardium. As such, shaft <b>40</b> has a height <b>47</b> corresponding to the expected pacing site depth and may have a relatively high compressive strength along its longitudinal axis to resist bending in a lateral or radial direction when a longitudinal axial force is applied against tip electrode <b>42</b> when pressed against the implant site, e.g., by applying longitudinal pushing force to the proximal end <b>34</b> of housing <b>30</b> to advance dart electrode <b>12</b> into the tissue within the target implant region <b>4</b>. Shaft <b>40</b> may be longitudinally non-compressive. Shaft <b>40</b> may be elastically deformable in lateral or radial directions when subjected to lateral or radial forces to allow temporary flexing, e.g., with tissue motion, but returns to its normally straight position when lateral forces diminish. When shaft <b>40</b> is not exposed to any external force, or to only a force along its longitudinal central axis, shaft <b>40</b> retains a straight, linear position as shown.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Fixation member <b>20</b> may include one or more tines having a normally curved position. The tines of fixation member <b>20</b> may be held in a distally extended position within a delivery tool as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The distal tips of the fixation member tines penetrate the heart tissue to a limited depth before elastically curving back proximally into the normally curved position (shown) upon release from the delivery tool. Aspects of fixation member <b>20</b> may correspond to the fixation member generally disclosed in U.S. 2016/0059002 A1 (Grubac, et al.) or in U.S. Pat. No. 9,119,959 (Rys et al.), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, distal fixation and electrode assembly <b>36</b> includes a distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b>. In the case of using pacemaker <b>10</b> for dual chamber pacing and sensing, tip electrode <b>42</b> may be used as a cathode electrode paired with proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> serving as a return anode electrode. Alternatively, distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may serve as a return anode electrode paired with tip electrode <b>42</b> for sensing ventricular signals and delivering ventricular pacing pulses. In other examples, distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may be a cathode electrode for sensing atrial signals and delivering pacing pulses to the atrial myocardium in the target implant region <b>4</b>. When distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> serves as an atrial cathode electrode, the proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> may serve as the return anode paired with tip electrode <b>42</b> for ventricular pacing and sensing and as the return anode paired with distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> for atrial pacing and sensing.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the target implant region <b>4</b> in some pacing applications is along the atrial endocardium <b>18</b>, generally inferior to the AV node <b>15</b> and the His bundle <b>5</b>. The dart electrode <b>42</b> is provided with a height <b>47</b> of shaft <b>40</b> that penetrates through atrial endocardium <b>18</b> in the target implant region <b>4</b>, through the central fibrous body <b>16</b> and into ventricular myocardium <b>14</b> without perforating through the ventricular endocardial surface <b>17</b>. When the full height <b>47</b> of dart electrode <b>12</b> is fully advanced into the target implant region <b>4</b>, tip electrode <b>42</b> rests within ventricular myocardium <b>14</b> and distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> is positioned in intimate contact with or close proximity to atrial endocardium <b>18</b>. Dart electrode <b>12</b> may have a total combined height <b>47</b> of tip electrode <b>42</b> and shaft <b>40</b> of approximately 3 mm to 8 mm in various examples. The diameter of shaft <b>40</b> may be less than 2 mm and may be 1 mm or less, or even <b>0</b>.<b>6</b> mm or less.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, dart electrode <b>12</b> is not provided as a fixation member or having any fixation feature such as a hook, helix, barb or other feature that tends to resist retraction of dart electrode <b>12</b> from the tissue at the implant site. Without fixation member <b>20</b>, dart electrode <b>12</b> having a normally straight, linear shaft may easily slide in and out of the heart tissue, at least during the acute phase after implantation. For example, dart electrode <b>12</b> may have a normally straight position or shape when not subjected to external forces and be isodiametric from its fixed attachment point at housing distal end <b>32</b> to the base of tip electrode <b>42</b>. Tip electrode <b>42</b> may have a maximum diameter at its base that interfaces with shaft <b>40</b> with the maximum diameter being isodiametric with shaft <b>40</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The diameter of tip electrode <b>40</b> may decrease from the base toward the distal tip of tip electrode <b>42</b>, e.g., according to a conical or hemispherical shape of the tip electrode <b>42</b>. In other examples, tip electrode <b>42</b> may be cylindrical with a relatively flat, blunted or rounded tip. The distal tip of tip electrode <b>42</b> may be blunted or rounded to avoid a sharp cutting point or edge.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a three-dimensional perspective view of intracardiac pacemaker <b>10</b> capable of dual chamber pacing and sensing according to one example. Pacemaker <b>10</b> has a distal fixation and electrode assembly <b>36</b> that includes a distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> implemented as a ring electrode. The distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> is positioned in intimate contact with or operative proximity to atrial tissue when fixation member tines <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>of fixation member <b>20</b>, engage with the atrial tissue. As described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, tines <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>, which are elastically deformable, may be extended distally during delivery of pacemaker <b>10</b> to the implant site. For example, tines <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and <b>20</b><i>c </i>pierce the atrial endocardial surface as the pacemaker <b>10</b> is advanced out of the delivery tool and flex back into their normally curved position (as shown) when no longer constrained within the delivery tool. As the tines <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>curve back into their normal position, the fixation member <b>20</b> acts to pull distal fixation member and electrode assembly <b>36</b> toward the atrial endocardial surface. As the distal fixation member and electrode assembly <b>36</b> is pulled toward the atrial endocardium, tip electrode <b>42</b> is advanced through the atrial myocardium and the central fibrous body and into the ventricular myocardium. Distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may then be positioned against the atrial endocardial surface.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may be a ring formed of an electrically conductive material, such as titanium, platinum, iridium or alloys thereof. Distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may be a single continuous ring electrode. In other examples, portions of the ring may be coated with an electrically insulating coating, e.g., parylene, polyurethane, silicone, epoxy, or other insulating coating, to reduce the electrically conductive surface area of the ring electrode. For instance, one or more sectors of the ring may be coated to separate two or more electrically conductive exposed surface areas of distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b>. Reducing the electrically conductive surface area of distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b>, e.g., by covering portions of the electrically conductive ring with an insulating coating, may increase the electrical impedance of distal housing-based <b>22</b> and thereby reduce the current delivered during a pacing pulse that captures the myocardium, e.g. the atrial myocardial tissue. A lower current drain conserves the power source, e.g., one or more rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, of pacemaker <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may be configured as an atrial cathode electrode for delivering pacing pulses to the atrial tissue at the implant site in combination with the proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> as the return anode. Electrodes <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may be used to sense atrial P-waves for use in controlling atrial pacing pulses (delivered in the absence of a sensed P-wave) and for controlling atrial-synchronized ventricular pacing pulses delivered using tip electrode <b>42</b> as a cathode and proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> as the return anode. In other examples, the distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> may be used as a return anode in conjunction with the cathode tip electrode <b>42</b> for ventricular pacing and sensing.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side perspective view of intracardiac pacemaker <b>10</b> according to another example in which pacemaker <b>10</b> may be configured for dual chamber pacing and sensing. In this example, the distal fixation member and electrode assembly <b>36</b> carries a distal housing-based electrode <b>52</b> that extends circumferentially around the periphery of assembly <b>36</b>, along circumferential surface <b>39</b>. In other examples, the distal housing-based electrode <b>52</b> may extend circumferentially around housing <b>30</b>, proximal to the assembly <b>36</b> but distal to the proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> and electrically isolated from proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b>. For example, housing <b>30</b> may be formed from an electrically non-conductive material, e.g., glass or ceramic, such that two or more housing-based electrodes <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> may extend circumferentially around housing <b>30</b>, electrically isolated from one another and individually coupled via respective electrical feedthroughs to electronic circuits, such as sensing and/or pacing circuits, enclosed within housing <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another example, distal fixation member and electrode assembly <b>36</b> may include multiple distal housing-based electrodes, e.g., one or more electrodes along its distal surface <b>38</b> and/or one or more electrodes along its circumferential surface <b>39</b>. For example, assembly <b>36</b> may include a ring electrode along the distal surface <b>38</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or one or more button electrodes along the distal surface <b>38</b> as described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and a ring electrode circumscribing the circumferential surface <b>39</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The distal housing-based electrodes may be individually selectable for electrical coupling to sensing and/or pacing circuits enclosed by housing <b>30</b> for use individually or in any combination as an electrode having a single polarity or as a combination of electrodes having dual polarity. For example, a single distal housing-based electrode or a combination of single-polarity distal housing-based electrodes may serve as an anode paired with tip electrode <b>42</b> serving as the cathode for ventricular pacing. A single distal housing-based electrode or a combination of single-polarity distal housing-based electrodes may serve as an atrial cathode electrode paired with the proximal housing-based electrode <b>24</b> serving as the anode.

In this example, dart electrode <b>12</b> includes a conical tip electrode <b>42</b> having a base <b>43</b> that has a greater diameter than the outer diameter <b>45</b> of shaft <b>40</b>. The distal tip <b>44</b> of tip electrode <b>42</b> may be blunted to avoid a sharp tip and high current density at the pacing site.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The distal housing-based electrode <b>62</b> includes one or more button electrodes, three button electrodes <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>62</b><i>c </i>in this example referred to collectively as distal housing-based electrode <b>62</b>, all positioned along the distal surface <b>38</b> of the distal fixation member and electrode assembly <b>36</b>. The three button electrodes <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>62</b><i>c </i>may be electrically coupled together to function as a single electrode. The separate button electrodes <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>62</b><i>c </i>may have a total surface area that is smaller than a continuous ring electrode, such as the distal housing-based electrode <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> or the distal housing-based electrode <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The smaller total surface area of distal housing-based electrode <b>62</b> increases the electrical impedance of the pacing load, reducing pacing current and battery drain of pacemaker <b>10</b>. In one example, the surface area of each button electrode <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>and <b>62</b><i>c </i>is 1.2 square mm or less for a combined total surface area of 3.6 square mm or less.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In other examples, the three button electrodes <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>, and <b>62</b><i>c </i>are individually selectable by switching circuitry included in the electronics enclosed by housing <b>30</b>.

For example, when the tip electrode <b>842</b> is advanced into ventricular tissue and housing <b>830</b> is implanted in the right atrium, tip electrode <b>842</b> may serve as a cathode electrode for delivering ventricular pacing pulses and sensing ventricular electrical signals using proximal housing based electrode <b>824</b> as a return anode.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Tissue piercing distal electrode <b>812</b> is peripheral to non-tissue piercing electrode <b>822</b> on distal-facing surface <b>838</b>. Non-tissue piercing electrode <b>822</b> may be, for example, a button or hemispherical electrode that protrudes from a central portion of distal-facing surface <b>838</b> and is circumscribed or encircled by, but spaced apart and electrically isolated from, helical shaft <b>840</b> of tissue piercing distal electrode <b>812</b>. In some examples, non-tissue piercing electrode <b>822</b> includes a coating or is a steroid eluting electrode. For example, non-tissue piercing electrode <b>822</b> may be a ring electrode defining a central opening or may include a recess or concavity for retaining an MCRD including a polymer matrix, e.g., a silicone or polyurethane base, and a steroid, e.g., sodium dexamethasone phosphate, compounded in the polymer matrix for eluting over time to reduce the foreign body response at the implant site. Both non-tissue piercing distal electrode <b>822</b> and helical shaft <b>840</b> may be centered along the longitudinal center axis of housing <b>830</b> in some examples with helical shaft <b>840</b> winding around and centered on non-tissue piercing distal electrode <b>822</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">When tissue piercing distal electrode <b>812</b> is fully advanced from the right atrium into direct contact with the ventricular myocardial or conductive tissue, the non-tissue piercing distal electrode <b>822</b> is anchored against or in operative proximity to atrial tissue. The active fixation of housing <b>830</b> in the atrial chamber by tissue piercing distal electrode <b>812</b> maintains the position of tip electrode <b>842</b> for ventricular sensing and pacing and the position of non-tissue piercing distal electrode <b>822</b> for atrial pacing and sensing for providing dual chamber pacing. Non-tissue piercing distal electrode <b>822</b> may function as an atrial cathode electrode for pacing the right atrium and sensing atrial signals in combination with proximal housing-based electrode <b>824</b> serving as the anode.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Thus, a pacemaker has been presented in the foregoing description with reference to specific embodiments.
