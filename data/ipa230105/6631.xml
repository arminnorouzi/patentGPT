The range of frequencies passed by a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; of the filter. The range of frequencies stopped by such a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; of the filter. A typical RF filter has at least one pass-band and at least one stop-band. Specific requirements on a passband or stop-band depend on the specific application. For example, a &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the insertion loss of a filter is better than a defined value such as 1 dB, 2 dB, or 3 dB. A &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the rejection of a filter is greater than a defined value such as 20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB, or greater depending on application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">RF filters are used in communications systems where information is transmitted over wireless links. For example, RF filters may be found in the RF front-ends of cellular base stations, mobile telephone and computing devices, satellite transceivers and ground stations, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, laptop computers and tablets, fixed point radio links, and other communications systems. RF filters are also used in radar and electronic and information warfare systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">RF filters typically require many design trade-offs to achieve, for each specific application, the best compromise between performance parameters such as insertion loss, rejection, isolation, power handling, linearity, size and cost. Specific design and manufacturing methods and enhancements can benefit simultaneously one or several of these requirements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Performance enhancements to the RF filters in a wireless system can have broad impact to system performance. Improvements in RF filters can be leveraged to provide system performance improvements such as larger cell size, longer battery life, higher data rates, greater network capacity, lower cost, enhanced security, higher reliability, etc. These improvements can be realized at many levels of the wireless system both separately and in combination, for example at the RF module, RF transceiver, mobile or fixed sub-system, or network levels.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">High performance RF filters for present communication systems commonly incorporate acoustic wave resonators including surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators, film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBAR), and other types of acoustic resonators. However, these existing technologies are not well-suited for use at the higher frequencies and bandwidths proposed for future communications networks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The desire for wider communication channel bandwidths will inevitably lead to the use of higher frequency communications bands. Radio access technology for mobile telephone networks has been standardized by the 3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project). Radio access technology for 5<sup>th </sup>generation mobile networks is defined in the 5G NR (new radio) standard. The 5G NR standard defines several new communications bands. Two of these new communications bands are n77, which uses the frequency range from 3300 MHz to 4200 MHz, and n79, which uses the frequency range from 4400 MHz to 5000 MHz. Both band n77 and band n79 use time-division duplexing (TDD), such that a communications device operating in band n77 and/or band n79 uses the same frequencies for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Bandpass filters for bands n77 and n79 must be capable of handling the transmit power of the communications device. WiFi bands at 5 GHz and 6 GHz also require high frequency and wide bandwidth. The 5G NR standard also defines millimeter wave communication bands with frequencies between 24.25 GHz and 40 GHz.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Transversely-Excited Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (XBAR) is an acoustic resonator structure for use in microwave filters. The XBAR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,491,291, titled TRANSVERSELY EXCITED FILM BULK ACOUSTIC RESONATOR. An XBAR resonator comprises an interdigital transducer (IDT) formed on a thin floating layer, or diaphragm, of a single-crystal piezoelectric material. The IDT includes a first set of parallel fingers, extending from a first busbar and a second set of parallel fingers extending from a second busbar. The first and second sets of parallel fingers are interleaved. A microwave signal applied to the IDT excites a shear primary acoustic wave in the piezoelectric diaphragm. XBAR resonators provide very high electromechanical coupling and high frequency capability. XBAR resonators may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers. XBARs are well suited for use in filters for communications bands with frequencies above 3 GHz.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic plan view and two schematic cross-sectional views of a transversely-excited film bulk acoustic resonator (XBAR).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an expanded schematic cross-sectional view of a portion of the XBAR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an alternative schematic cross-sectional view of the XBAR of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graphic illustrating a shear primary acoustic mode in an XBAR.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of a filter using XBARs.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of an XBAR illustrating steps of a process of making the XBAR.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>F</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of an alternative XBAR illustrating steps of a process of making the alternative XBAR.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>D</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of another alternative XBAR illustrating steps of a process of making the other alternative XBAR.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Throughout this description, elements appearing in figures are assigned three-digit or four-digit reference designators, where the two least significant digits are specific to the element and the one or two most significant digit is the figure number where the element is first introduced.

XBAR resonators such as the resonator <b>100</b> may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers. XBARs are well suited for use in filters for communications bands with frequencies above 3 GHz.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The XBAR <b>100</b> includes a piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> having a front surface <b>112</b> and a back surface <b>114</b>. The front and back surfaces are essentially parallel. &#x201c;Essentially parallel&#x201d; means parallel to the extent possible within normal manufacturing tolerances. The piezoelectric plate is a thin single-crystal layer of a piezoelectric material such as lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, lanthanum gallium silicate, gallium nitride, or aluminum nitride. The piezoelectric plate is cut such that the orientation of the X, Y, and Z crystalline axes with respect to the front and back surfaces is known and consistent. XBARs may be fabricated on piezoelectric plates with various crystallographic orientations including Z-cut, rotated Z-cut, and rotated Y-cut.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A surface <b>122</b> of a substrate <b>120</b> is attached to a back surface <b>114</b> of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. A portion of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> is not attached to the substrate <b>120</b> and forms a diaphragm <b>115</b> spanning a cavity <b>140</b> formed in the substrate <b>120</b>. The portion of the piezoelectric plate that spans the cavity is referred to herein as the &#x201c;diaphragm&#x201d; due to its physical resemblance to the diaphragm of a microphone. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the diaphragm <b>115</b> is contiguous with the rest of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> around all of a perimeter <b>145</b> of the cavity <b>140</b>. In this context, &#x201c;contiguous&#x201d; means &#x201c;continuously connected without any intervening item&#x201d;. The substrate <b>120</b> provides mechanical support to the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. The piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> may be attached directly to the substrate <b>120</b> or may be attached to the substrate <b>120</b> via one or more intermediate material layers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The substrate <b>120</b> may be, for example, formed of the same materials as the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. Forming the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>120</b> of the same material prevents a thermal property mismatch between them, which could lead to a degradation in performance. Even with an intermediate material layer formed of a different material between the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>120</b>, the temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) is improved (lowered) by having the substrate and the piezoelectric plate formed of the same material. Silicon has a linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of about 2.6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>IC, and lithium niobate has a linear CTE of about 7-15&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>/C. In other XBAR devices where the substrate is formed of a different material (e.g., silicon), the device would have a large CTE mismatch that would result in a large TCF.
