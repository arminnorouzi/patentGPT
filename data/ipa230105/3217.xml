In an embodiment, a refrigerant circuit <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C may be modified to have a single expansion device instead of two.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The refrigerant circuits <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C can be applied in a variety of systems used to control one or more environmental condition (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality, or the like) in a space (generally referred to as a conditioned space). Examples of such systems include, but are not limited to, HVACR systems, transport refrigeration systems, or the like. Examples of a conditioned space include, but and not limited to, a portion of a home, building, an environmentally controlled container on a vehicle, ship, or vessel, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the refrigerant circuit <b>1</b>A includes, the compressor <b>10</b>, the condenser <b>14</b>, the first expander <b>16</b>, the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032;, and the evaporator <b>18</b> are fluidly connected via refrigerant lines <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>38</b>. In an embodiment, the refrigerant lines <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>38</b> can alternatively be referred to as the refrigerant conduits <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>35</b>, and <b>38</b></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, the compressor <b>10</b> compresses a working fluid (e.g., a heat transfer fluid such as a refrigerant, refrigerant mixture, or the like) from a relatively lower pressure gas (e.g., suction pressure) to a relatively higher-pressure gas (e.g., discharge pressure). In an embodiment, the compressor <b>10</b> can be a positive displacement compressor. For example, the compressor <b>10</b> can be a screw compressor, a scroll compressor, a reciprocating compressor, or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The relatively higher-pressure gas discharged from the compressor <b>10</b> is also at a relatively higher temperature and flows from the compressor <b>10</b> through refrigerant line <b>20</b> to the condenser <b>14</b>. The working fluid flows through the condenser <b>14</b> and rejects heat to a first process fluid (e.g., water, air, etc.). The cooled working fluid, which is now liquid or mostly liquid, flows to the first expander <b>16</b> via the refrigerant line <b>22</b>. The first expander <b>16</b> allows the working fluid to expand and reduces the pressure of the working fluid. In an embodiment, the expander may be an expansion valve, expansion plate, expansion vessel, orifice, or the like, or other such types of expansion mechanisms. It is to be appreciated that the expander may be any type of expander used in the field for expanding a working fluid to cause the working fluid to decrease in temperature. The gaseous/liquid working fluid has a lower temperature after being expanded by the first expander <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">This reduced pressure can be at an intermediate pressure that is higher than the suction pressure but lower than the discharge pressure of the compressor <b>10</b>. As a result, the working fluid discharged from the first expander <b>16</b> can be in a liquid form, a gaseous form, or a combination thereof. The working fluid discharged from the first expander <b>16</b> flows to the evaporator <b>18</b> and absorbs heat from a second process fluid (e.g., water, air, etc.), heating the working fluid, and converts the working fluid to a gaseous or a mostly gaseous form. The gaseous working fluid then returns to the compressor <b>10</b> via the refrigerant line <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A portion of the cooled working fluid from the condenser <b>14</b> can flow to the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; via <b>21</b>. After passing through the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032;, the portion of the cooled working fluid can flow to the compressor <b>10</b> via a refrigerant line <b>28</b>. This portion can be fed into the compressor <b>10</b> at an intermediate pressure fluid inlet to be injected to a location of the compression chamber of the compressor wherein the fluid being compressed is suitable for receiving a fluid at the intermediate pressure. The above-described process continues while the refrigerant circuit <b>1</b> is operating, for example, in a cooling mode (e.g., while the compressor <b>10</b> is in operation).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; can be alternatively disposed between the expander <b>16</b> and the evaporator <b>18</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cooled working fluid from the condenser <b>14</b> can flow to the expander <b>16</b>. After the expander <b>16</b> and before the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032;, a portion of the working fluid can be fed into the compressor <b>10</b> at an intermediate pressure. The remaining portion of the cooled working fluid can flow to the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; via the refrigerant line <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the refrigerant circuit <b>1</b>A can further include a heat exchanger <b>29</b> after the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032;. The heat exchanger <b>29</b> exchanges energy between the working fluid expanded in the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; and the remaining portion of the cooled working fluid from the condenser <b>14</b> provided by the refrigerant line <b>22</b>. The working fluid passes the second expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; and enters into the heat exchanger <b>29</b> via the refrigerant line <b>35</b>. The working fluid is expanded by the expander <b>16</b>&#x2032; and exchanges heat in the heat exchanger <b>29</b> with the portion of the working fluid from the refrigerant line <b>22</b>, cooling the working fluid from the refrigerant line <b>22</b>. The working fluid from the refrigerant line <b>22</b> is cooled in the heat exchanger <b>29</b> before being provided to the first expander <b>16</b> via the refrigerant line <b>38</b>. By cooling the portion of the working fluid using the heat exchanger <b>29</b>, the overall capacity of the refrigerant circuit <b>1</b>C is increased without increasing the capacity of the compressor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top view of a compressor <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment.
