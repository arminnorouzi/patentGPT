This enables improvements in the sublimation-dye receptivity of the receiving layer, the density of an image formed on the receiving layer, and the transferability of the transfer layer. When the receiving layer is formed of multiple layers, the logarithmic damping ratio &#x394;E and the minimum transferable temperature tend to depend on the composition of the surface layer of the receiving layer.
