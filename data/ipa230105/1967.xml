id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to remote wear monitoring of components in a railway rail fastening system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A railway rail fastening system for fastening a railway rail to an underlying track foundation, such as a wooden or concrete sleeper (tie) or slab track, typically comprises two fasteners in the form of rail clips for location one on either side of a rail, and respective rail clip anchoring devices (which may be integrally formed with a baseplate secured to the foundation or cast in) for retaining the rail clips when the rail clips bear on the foot of the rail. When the foundation is a concrete sleeper or slab, the system typically further comprises an elastic rail pad, for location between the rail foot and the underlying foundation, and electrical insulators (which may be in one or two parts), each comprising a side post, for insulating the rail clip anchoring device from the rail which is to be located between the edge of the rail foot and a front face of the rail clip anchoring device, and a blade or toe portion, for insulating the rail clip from the rail. There are many different types of railway rail fastening system, which differ from one another in various ways, for example in the kind of rail clip they use, and/or the kind of anchoring device they have, and/or the kind of rail pad and/or electrical insulators they employ.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During use in track, all components of a fastening system will undergo wear to some extent, but those which wear most quickly are the rail pad and the side posts of electrical insulators on the field side of the rail (i.e. the outer side of the rail in track); side post wear is one of the major failure mechanisms of fastening systems. Consequently, the wear condition of the rail pad and electrical insulators must be checked regularly. Conventionally, in order to check the condition of an electrical insulator in situ accurately, it is necessary to dismantle the assembled rail fastening system, as the side post is hidden below the blade of the insulator. A similar issue arises with checking wear of the pad, where in addition the rail must be lifted. Such checks are time-consuming and labour-intensive processes which require lengthy closure of the track to rail traffic, before it is even known whether replacement of any components is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore desirable to provide a faster and less intrusive way to assess the wear of electrical insulators and/or rail pads in track.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The type of fastening system (and/or the rail section) may vary along the length of a track, but records of exactly which type of fastening system and/or which rail section are in use at every location along a track are not always available, or easily interpreted. As one of the first jobs in assessing condition is to know what type of system and rail section is being inspected, inspection must be carried out by an experienced track engineer familiar with many different fastening systems and rail sections.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is also desirable to facilitate identification of rail fastening systems and/or rail sections for use in assessing condition of component wear.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of a first aspect there is provided a computer-implemented method of assessing wear of a side post of an electrical insulator, wherein the electrical insulator is part of an assembled railway rail fastening system securing a rail foot of a railway rail, the method comprising: obtaining data derived from a three-dimensional, 3D, scan of a region comprising at least part of the rail and at least a reference portion of the assembled railway rail fastening system; deriving from the data at least one measurement indicating a distance between a point on the rail and the reference portion of the assembled railway rail fastening system; and assessing wear of the side post of the electrical insulator based on the at least one measurement.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The reference portion may be a portion of a rail clip anchoring device of the assembled railway rail fastening system. The portion of the rail clip anchoring device may be a front edge of the rail clip anchoring device adjacent to the edge of the rail foot, or a rear edge of the rail clip anchoring device opposite to the front edge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the rail is supported by a railway baseplate providing or connected to a rail clip anchoring device of the assembled railway fastening system, the reference portion may be a portion of the railway baseplate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The point on the rail may be on one of the edges of the rail foot.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Assessing wear of the side post of the electrical insulator may comprise: comparing the derived value of the measurement with a stored value for the measurement; and outputting the result of the comparison. The stored value may be obtained from data derived from an earlier 3D scan of the region. The stored value may be one of: a value of the measurement for the electrical insulator obtained before the railway rail fastening system was assembled; a typical value of the measurement for an unused electrical insulator of the same type as the electrical insulator in the assembled railway rail fastening system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of a second aspect there is provided a computer-implemented method of assessing wear of a rail pad, wherein the rail pad is part of an assembled railway rail fastening system securing a rail foot of a railway rail to a rail support and is located at least partly between a bottom surface of the rail foot and the rail support, the method comprising: obtaining data derived from a three-dimensional, 3D, scan of a region comprising at least part of a top surface of the rail foot and at least one fixed point spaced from the rail; deriving from the data at least one measurement indicating a vertical distance between the top surface of the rail foot and the at least one fixed point; and assessing wear of the rail pad based on the at least one measurement.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rail support may be a track foundation, and the fixed point may be located on a top surface of the track foundation, or the rail support may be a baseplate secured to a track foundation, and the fixed point may be located on a top surface of the baseplate or the track foundation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The at least one measurement may indicate the thickness of the rail pad beneath the rail foot on one side of the rail.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The region in the 3D scan may comprise at least a part of the top surface of the rail foot on each side of the rail. At least two measurements may be derived from the data. One of the measurements may indicate a vertical distance between the top surface of the rail foot on one side of the rail and the at least one fixed point. Another of the measurements may indicate a vertical distance between the top surface of the rail foot on the other side of the rail and either the at least one fixed point or another fixed point visible in the 3D scan. The at least two measurements may indicate the respective thicknesses of the rail pad beneath the rail foot on each side of the rail. The at least two measurements may be averaged to obtain an assessment of the overall wear of the rail pad beneath the rail foot, or used to determine an angle of cant of the rail from which an assessment of wear of the rail pad on each side of the rail may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Assessing wear of the rail pad may comprise: comparing the derived value of the measurement with a stored value for the measurement; and outputting the result of the comparison. The stored value may be obtained from data derived from an earlier 3D scan of the region. The stored value may be one of: a value of the measurement for the rail pad obtained before the railway rail fastening system was assembled; a typical value of the measurement for an unused rail pad of the same type as the rail pad in the assembled railway rail fastening system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment according to the first or second aspect, obtaining the data may comprise: extracting measurement data from an image produced from a combination of an image of the region obtained from the 3D scan with one of (i) an image of a 3D model of the assembled railway rail fastening system and (ii) an image of the assembled railway rail fastening system created before the 3D scan.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A method embodying the first or second aspect may further comprise, before assessing wear, using the 3D scan to determine at least one of: an identity of the assembled railway rail fastening system; a type of the assembled railway rail fastening system; a type of the electrical insulator; a type of a component of the assembled railway rail fastening system other than the electrical insulator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Determining the identity or type may be carried out by: matching the 3D scan with at least part of (i) an assembled railway rail fastening system from a database of assembled railway rail fastening systems or (ii) a 3D model of an assembled railway rail fastening system from a database of 3D models of assembled railway rail fastening systems; and determining that the assembled railway rail fastening system matched with the 3D scan is an assembled railway rail fastening system having the same identity, or is of the same type, as the assembled railway rail fastening system in the 3D scan. Assessing wear may comprise using a stored value for the measurement which is associated with the assembled railway rail fastening system with which the assembled railway rail system in the 3D scan has been matched.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Determining the identity or type may be carried out using a neural network trained as a classifier.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In embodiments according to the first or second aspect, one or each 3D scan may be obtained using one of: a LiDAR scanner; a structured light scanner; a stereo depth scanner.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a drawing of a section on the centreline of one type of assembled railway rail fastening system;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a view of a portion of the rail fastening system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method according to an embodiment of a first aspect;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a top view of an assembled rail fastening system, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a top view of a portion of the rail fastening system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the rail fastening system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, for use in explaining an embodiment of the first aspect;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an image of part of an assembled railway rail fastening system;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> are respective cross-sectional views of an assembled railway rail fastening system for use in explaining embodiments according to the second aspect;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a section of a type of railway rail, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method according to an embodiment of a second aspect; and</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computing device suitable for carrying out a method according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A drawing of a section on the centreline of one type of assembled railway rail fastening system <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The measured distance from the rail to the fixed point may be compared to a known reference distance, and from the difference between the measured and reference distances an indication of a degree of wear of the side post <b>1</b>A may be determined.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a computer-implemented method embodying the present invention which may be used to assess wear of a side post of an electrical insulator, where the electrical insulator is part of an assembled railway rail fastening system securing a rail foot of a railway rail. In step S<b>1</b>, data derived from a 3D scan of a region comprising at least part of the rail and at least a reference portion of the assembled railway rail fastening system is obtained. In step S<b>2</b>, at least one measurement indicating a distance between a point on the rail and the reference portion of the assembled railway rail fastening system is derived from the data. In Step S<b>3</b>, wear of the side post of the electrical insulator is assessed based on the at least one measurement</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In contrast to the conventional method which requires the railway rail fastening system to be dismantled before the side post <b>1</b>A of the insulator <b>1</b> is clearly visible, in an embodiment of the invention the measurement may be extracted from a 3D scan of the assembled railway rail fastening system <b>10</b>, taken vertically above the system <b>10</b> or at an angle to the vertical, even if the side post <b>1</b>A is obscured. The 3D scan may be obtained using one or more of a structured light scanner, a LiDAR scanner, a stereo depth scanner, or any other suitable technology. For example, in one embodiment, the scanner may be hand-held and operated by someone walking the track. In another embodiment the scanner may be secured to a track vehicle (such as a train or trolley) movable along the track and operated either manually or automatically. The scanner may comprise a single camera or multiple cameras. The scanner may be positioned vertically or at an angle above all or part of a rail fastening system in order to capture one or more images of all or part of the rail fastening system. The scanner may be operable to take scans of the rail fastening system on only one side (i.e. field side) of the rail, or simultaneously of the rail fastening system on both sides of the rail.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a drawing of an assembled railway rail fastening system <b>10</b>, which is provided to illustrate an example of a measurement which may be extracted from a 3D scan in order to assess the thickness of the side post of insulator <b>1</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is an enlarged portion of the field side of the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. In this example, anchoring device <b>3</b> is integrally formed as part of a baseplate <b>5</b>, which is in turn secured by bolts <b>6</b> to an underlying railway sleeper <b>8</b>. A rail pad <b>4</b> is located between the rail foot <b>2</b> and the baseplate <b>5</b>, and a baseplate pad <b>7</b> is located between the baseplate <b>5</b> and sleeper <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates that a measurement may be extracted from a 3D scan of such an assembled railway rail fastening system <b>10</b>, from which the thickness of the side post may be deduced, namely the distance dl between a line L denoting the edge <b>2</b>Af of the rail foot <b>2</b>A on the field side of the rail <b>2</b> and a rear edge <b>3</b>B of the field-side anchoring device <b>3</b>, both of which may be clearly visible in the scan. Alternatively, measurement may be made of the distance between line L and a front edge <b>3</b>A (or another portion) of the field-side anchoring device <b>3</b>, or between line L and another fixed point (for example an end <b>5</b>A of the baseplate <b>5</b>), or between a line (not shown) denoting the edge <b>2</b>Ag of the rail foot <b>2</b>A on the gauge side of the rail <b>2</b> (or another part of the rail <b>2</b>) and any fixed point on the anchoring device <b>3</b> or baseplate <b>5</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, for example, shows a measurement of the distance between a line (not shown) denoting the edge of a rail foot on the gauge side of the rail and the rear face of the adjacent anchoring device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A first method of using 3D scanning to assess wear is to make a series of scans at different points in time of the same part of a particular fastening system. By comparing one scan to another made earlier, it is possible to determine what has changed in the intervening period, and to correlate the differences with wear of those components of the system which are expected to wear. An advantage of this is that in principle it is not necessary to have identified the type of rail fastening system shown in the scans.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Thus, one way of obtaining a wear measurement is by extracting measurement data from an image produced from a combination of an image of the region obtained from the 3D scan with one of (i) an image of a 3D model of the assembled railway rail fastening system and (ii) an image of the assembled railway rail fastening system created before the 3D scan. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a greyscale image of part of an assembled railway rail fastening system made by combining two 3D scans, the first performed at a reference time point and the second performed after elapse of a period of time during which forces have been applied to the assembled railway rail fastening system during use in track. The effect of the wear resulting from the applied forces on the fastening system is shown by different shades of grey (ideally a colour image would be used to illustrate the regions of wear more clearly using a colour scale, for example red showing areas of greatest wear, green showing areas with no wear). Differences in any of the X-Y-Z directions may be measured directly from the scan, and resolved to fractions of a millimetre.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to find out from a measurement of the lateral position of the rail <b>2</b> relative to the anchoring device <b>3</b> how much the side post <b>1</b>A has worn, it is necessary to know what this measurement was initially when the system <b>10</b> was installed. The scan comparison process described above will give measurements of change, but it cannot provide information about the initial measurements (and therefore how much residual life there might be in the components) unless this information is supplied by other means. For example, without information on the rail fastening system shown in the scans, it may be difficult to distinguish between a brand new (unworn) 5 mm thick rail pad and a 10 mm thick rail pad that has worn down to 5 mm thickness.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To obtain the initial measurements, it is necessary to know which particular one of the systems <b>10</b> is shown in the 3D scan or, on the assumption that the initial relative position of components in an assembled system <b>10</b> of a particular type will always be the same (within an acceptable tolerance), what type of system it is. Of course, such information may be readily obtained if a database containing detailed data relating to the types and/or particular identities of systems installed along a track is available. However, as mentioned above, such detailed data is often absent or hard to interpret. If so, an alternative source of information is required.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this case the required information may be obtained using a second method of assessing wear (which may be used alone or together with the first method) in which what rail fastening system (or component of a rail fastening system) is shown in a scan is identified by matching it with a stored model of a 3D fastening system from a database of different designs of rail fastening system (which might number in the hundreds). By doing so it may be possible to extract much more detail relating to the fastening system, including the exact positions of parts that are not visible, either by eye or in the scan, for example exactly where the hidden edge of the anchoring device <b>3</b> and the hidden surface of the sleeper rail seat under the rail <b>2</b> are located.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, one way of obtaining information on initial/unworn measurements is to determine the identity or type of the system by comparing a 3D scan of the system in track with 2D images or 3D scans of various different systems to find a matching system, and obtaining the information required from information stored in respect of the matching system. Another way of obtaining the necessary information is to determine the identity or type of the system by comparing a 3D scan of the system in track (desirably, for example, the same 3D scan from which measurements have been or are to be derived) to a stored 3D model of the system in its intended configuration, i.e. how it was at installation. That is, a database of 3D models of different types of system is provided against which the 3D scan is compared to find a matching 3D model. In each case, matching to determine the identity or type of a system may be carried out automatically, for example using a neural network trained as an image classifier.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As mentioned above, it is also desirable to be able to obtain measurements of rail pad thickness in order to assess rail pad wear. A worn rail pad <b>4</b> fills the gap between two (likely non-parallel) planes, that is the bottom surface of the rail foot <b>2</b>A and the top surface of the underlying rail support, e.g. baseplate <b>5</b>, neither of which can be seen in a scan of the system in track. However, rail pad wear may be assessed from a measurement of the height of the rail head <b>2</b>H to the top of the baseplate <b>5</b> (or another fixed point visible in the scan), or more preferably from a measurement of the height of the rail foot <b>2</b>A on one or both sides of the rail <b>2</b> to a visible fixed point (or points) on the top of the baseplate <b>5</b> (or another known fixed point), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A</figref> (one side) and <b>5</b>B (both sides). In one embodiment, the height of the rail foot (or each rail foot) is measured from a fixed point on the rail foot where there is a change in section, this point being particular to each type of rail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows a rail section of a 60E1 section rail and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows a detail of the rail foot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> with example measurement points.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a computer-implemented method embodying the present invention which may be used to assess wear of a rail pad, wherein the rail pad is part of an assembled railway rail fastening system securing a rail foot of a railway rail to a rail support and is located at least partly between a bottom surface of the rail foot and the rail support. At Step <b>10</b> data derived from a 3D scan of a region comprising at least part of a top surface of the rail foot and at least one fixed point spaced from the rail is obtained. At Step S<b>20</b> at least one measurement indicating a vertical distance between the top surface of the rail foot and the at least one fixed point is derived from the data. At Step S<b>30</b> wear of the rail pad is assessed, based on the at least one measurement.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Measuring the height of the rail foot above, rather than that of the rail head, will typically provide a more reliable measurement, as it will not be influenced by rail head wear. Measurements of rail foot height on both sides of the rail may be averaged to obtain an overall assessment of pad wear. Alternatively, measurements of the height of the rail foot above the sleeper/baseplate on both sides of the rail may enable an assessment of rail cant to be made. Calculating the rail cant across the rail width will enable a determination to be made as to whether the rail pad has worn more on one side that the other, which is often the case, especially on curves.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computing device, such as a data storage server, which embodies the present invention, and which may be used to implement some or all of the operations of a method embodying the present invention, and perform some or all of the tasks of apparatus of an embodiment.
