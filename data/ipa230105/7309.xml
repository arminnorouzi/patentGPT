However, the embodiments are not intended for limiting the disclosure. The terms used in the following description are used to merely describe specific embodiments, but are not intended to limit the disclosure. An expression of a singular number includes an expression of the plural number, so long as it is clearly read differently. The terms such as &#x201c;include&#x201d; and &#x201c;have&#x201d; are intended to indicate that features, numbers, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof used in the following description exist and it should be thus understood that the possibility of existence or addition of one or more different features, numbers, steps, operations, elements, components, or combinations thereof is not excluded.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, each configuration of the drawings described in this document is an independent illustration for explaining functions as features that are different from each other, and does not mean that each configuration is implemented by mutually different hardware or different software. For example, two or more of the configurations can be combined to form one configuration, and one configuration can also be divided into multiple configurations. Without departing from the gist of this document, embodiments in which configurations are combined and/or separated are included in the scope of claims.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, examples of the present embodiment will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In addition, like reference numerals are used to indicate like elements throughout the drawings, and the same descriptions on the like elements will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This document relates to video/image coding. For example, methods/embodiments disclosed in this document may be related to the versatile video coding (VVC) standard (ITU-T Rec. H.266), the next-generation video/image coding standard after VVC, or other video coding related standards (e.g., high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard (ITU-T Rec. H.265), essential video coding (EVC) standard, AVS2 standard, and the like).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">This document suggests various embodiments of video/image coding, and the above embodiments may also be performed in combination with each other unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this document, a video may refer to a series of images over time. A picture generally refers to the unit representing one image at a particular time frame, and a slice/tile refers to the unit constituting a part of the picture in terms of coding. A slice/tile may include one or more coding tree units (CTUs). One picture may consist of one or more slices/tiles. One picture may consist of one or more tile groups. One tile group may include one or more tiles.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A pixel or a pel may mean a smallest unit constituting one picture (or image). Also, &#x2018;sample&#x2019; may be used as a term corresponding to a pixel. A sample may generally represent a pixel or a value of a pixel, and may represent only a pixel/pixel value of a luma component or only a pixel/pixel value of a chroma component.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A unit may represent a basic unit of image processing. The unit may include at least one of a specific region of the picture and information related to the region. One unit may include one luma block and two chroma (ex. cb, cr) blocks. The unit may be used interchangeably with terms such as block or area in some cases. In a general case, an M&#xd7;N block may include samples (or sample arrays) or a set (or array) of transform coefficients of M columns and N rows.

The image partitioner <b>210</b>, the predictor <b>220</b>, the residual processor <b>230</b>, the entropy encoder <b>240</b>, the adder <b>250</b>, and the filter <b>260</b>, which have been described above, may be configured by one or more hardware components (e.g., encoder chipsets or processors) according to an embodiment. In addition, the memory <b>270</b> may include a decoded picture buffer (DPB), and may also be configured by a digital storage medium. The hardware component may further include the memory <b>270</b> as an internal/external component.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The image partitioner <b>210</b> may split an input image (or, picture, frame) input to the encoding apparatus <b>200</b> into one or more processing units. As an example, the processing unit may be called a coding unit (CU). In this case, the coding unit may be recursively split according to a Quad-tree binary-tree ternary-tree (QTBTTT) structure from a coding tree unit (CTU) or the largest coding unit (LCU). For example, one coding unit may be split into a plurality of coding units of a deeper depth based on a quad-tree structure, a binary-tree structure, and/or a ternary-tree structure. In this case, for example, the quad-tree structure is first applied and the binary-tree structure and/or the ternary-tree structure may be later applied. Alternatively, the binary-tree structure may also be first applied. A coding process according to the present disclosure may be performed based on a final coding unit which is not split any more. In this case, based on coding efficiency according to image characteristics or the like, the maximum coding unit may be directly used as the final coding unit, or as necessary, the coding unit may be recursively split into coding units of a deeper depth, such that a coding unit having an optimal size may be used as the final coding unit. Here, the coding process may include a process such as prediction, transform, and reconstruction to be described later. As another example, the processing unit may further include a prediction unit (PU) or a transform unit (TU). In this case, each of the prediction unit and the transform unit may be split or partitioned from the aforementioned final coding unit. The prediction unit may be a unit of sample prediction, and the transform unit may be a unit for inducing a transform coefficient and/or a unit for inducing a residual signal from the transform coefficient.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The unit may be interchangeably used with the term such as a block or an area in some cases. Generally, an M&#xd7;N block may represent samples composed of M columns and N rows or a group of transform coefficients. The sample may generally represent a pixel or a value of the pixel, and may also represent only the pixel/pixel value of a luma component, and also represent only the pixel/pixel value of a chroma component. The sample may be used as the term corresponding to a pixel or a pel configuring one picture (or image).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The subtractor <b>231</b> may generate a residual signal (residual block, residual samples, or residual sample array) by subtracting a prediction signal (predicted block, prediction samples, or prediction sample array) output from the predictor <b>220</b> from an input image signal (original block, original samples, or original sample array), and the generated residual signal is transmitted to the transformer <b>232</b>. The predictor <b>220</b> may perform prediction for a processing target block (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;current block&#x201d;), and generate a predicted block including prediction samples for the current block. The predictor <b>220</b> may determine whether intra prediction or inter prediction is applied on a current block or in a CU unit. As described later in the description of each prediction mode, the predictor may generate various kinds of information related to prediction, such as prediction mode information, and transfer the generated information to the entropy encoder <b>240</b>. The information on the prediction may be encoded in the entropy encoder <b>240</b> and output in the form of a bitstream.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The intra predictor <b>222</b> may predict a current block with reference to samples within a current picture. The referenced samples may be located neighboring to the current block, or may also be located away from the current block according to the prediction mode. The prediction modes in the intra prediction may include a plurality of non-directional modes and a plurality of directional modes. The non-directional mode may include, for example, a DC mode or a planar mode. The directional mode may include, for example, 33 directional prediction modes or 65 directional prediction modes according to the fine degree of the prediction direction. However, this is illustrative and the directional prediction modes which are more or less than the above number may be used according to the setting. The intra predictor <b>222</b> may also determine the prediction mode applied to the current block using the prediction mode applied to the neighboring block.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The inter predictor <b>221</b> may induce a predicted block of the current block based on a reference block (reference sample array) specified by a motion vector on a reference picture. At this time, in order to decrease the amount of motion information transmitted in the inter prediction mode, the motion information may be predicted in units of a block, a sub-block, or a sample based on the correlation of the motion information between the neighboring block and the current block. The motion information may include a motion vector and a reference picture index. The motion information may further include inter prediction direction (L0 prediction, L1 prediction, Bi prediction, or the like) information. In the case of the inter prediction, the neighboring block may include a spatial neighboring block existing within the current picture and a temporal neighboring block existing in the reference picture. The reference picture including the reference block and the reference picture including the temporal neighboring block may also be the same as each other, and may also be different from each other. The temporal neighboring block may be called the name such as a collocated reference block, a collocated CU (colCU), or the like, and the reference picture including the temporal neighboring block may also be called a collocated picture (colPic). For example, the inter predictor <b>221</b> may configure a motion information candidate list based on the neighboring blocks, and generate information indicating what candidate is used to derive the motion vector and/or the reference picture index of the current block. The inter prediction may be performed based on various prediction modes, and for example, in the case of a skip mode and a merge mode, the inter predictor <b>221</b> may use the motion information of the neighboring block as the motion information of the current block. In the case of the skip mode, the residual signal may not be transmitted unlike the merge mode. A motion vector prediction (MVP) mode may indicate the motion vector of the current block by using the motion vector of the neighboring block as a motion vector predictor, and signaling a motion vector difference.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The predictor <b>220</b> may generate a prediction signal based on various prediction methods described below. For example, the predictor may not only apply intra prediction or inter prediction to predict one block but also simultaneously apply both intra prediction and inter prediction. This may be called combined inter and intra prediction (CIIP). In addition, the predictor may perform an intra block copy (IBC) for prediction of a block. The intra block copy may be used for content image/moving image coding of a game or the like, for example, screen content coding (SCC). The IBC basically performs prediction in the current picture, but may be performed similarly to inter prediction in that a reference block is derived in the current picture. That is, the IBC may use at least one of inter prediction techniques described in the present document.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The prediction signal generated through the inter predictor <b>221</b> and/or the intra predictor <b>222</b> may be used to generate a reconstructed signal or to generate a residual signal. The transformer <b>232</b> may generate transform coefficients by applying a transform technique to the residual signal. For example, the transform technique may include at least one of a discrete cosine transform (DCT), a discrete sine transform (DST), a graph-based transform (GBT), or a conditionally non-linear transform (CNT). Here, the GBT means transform obtained from a graph when relationship information between pixels is represented by the graph. The CNT refers to the transform obtained based on a prediction signal generated using all previously reconstructed pixels. In addition, the transform process may be applied to square pixel blocks having the same size, or may be applied to blocks having a variable size rather than a square.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The quantizer <b>233</b> may quantize the transform coefficients and transmit them to the entropy encoder <b>240</b>, and the entropy encoder <b>240</b> may encode the quantized signal (information on the quantized transform coefficients) and output a bitstream. The information on the quantized transform coefficients may be referred to as residual information. The quantizer <b>233</b> may rearrange block type quantized transform coefficients into a one-dimensional vector form based on a coefficient scanning order, and generate information on the quantized transform coefficients based on the quantized transform coefficients in the one-dimensional vector form. The entropy encoder <b>240</b> may perform various encoding methods such as, for example, exponential Golomb, context-adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC), context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC), and the like. The entropy encoder <b>240</b> may encode information necessary for video/image reconstruction together with or separately from the quantized transform coefficients (e.g., values of syntax elements and the like). Encoded information (e.g., encoded video/image information) may be transmitted or stored in the unit of a network abstraction layer (NAL) in the form of a bitstream. The video/image information may further include information on various parameter sets, such as an adaptation parameter set (APS), a picture parameter set (PPS), a sequence parameter set (SPS), or a video parameter set (VPS). In addition, the video/image information may further include general constraint information. In the present document, information and/or syntax elements being signaled/transmitted to be described later may be encoded through the above-described encoding process, and be included in the bitstream. The bitstream may be transmitted through a network, or may be stored in a digital storage medium. Here, the network may include a broadcasting network and/or a communication network, and the digital storage medium may include various storage media, such as USB, SD, CD, DVD, Blu-ray, HDD, SSD, and the like. A transmitter (not illustrated) transmitting a signal output from the entropy encoder <b>240</b> and/or a storage unit (not illustrated) storing the signal may be configured as an internal/external element of the encoding apparatus <b>200</b>, and alternatively, the transmitter may be included in the entropy encoder <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The quantized transform coefficients output from the quantizer <b>233</b> may be used to generate a prediction signal. For example, the residual signal (residual block or residual samples) may be reconstructed by applying dequantization and inverse transform to the quantized transform coefficients through the dequantizer <b>234</b> and the inverse transformer <b>235</b>. The adder <b>250</b> adds the reconstructed residual signal to the prediction signal output from the predictor <b>220</b> to generate a reconstructed signal (reconstructed picture, reconstructed block, reconstructed samples, or reconstructed sample array). If there is no residual for the processing target block, such as a case that a skip mode is applied, the predicted block may be used as the reconstructed block. The generated reconstructed signal may be used for intra prediction of a next processing target block in the current picture, and may be used for inter prediction of a next picture through filtering as described below.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Meanwhile, luma mapping with chroma scaling (LMCS) may be applied during a picture encoding and/or reconstruction process.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The filter <b>260</b> may improve subjective/objective image quality by applying filtering to the reconstructed signal.

Through this, a predicted block including prediction samples for a current block as a block to be coded (i.e., a coding target block) may be generated. Here, the predicted block includes prediction samples in a spatial domain (or pixel domain). The predicted block is derived in the same manner in an encoding apparatus and a decoding apparatus, and the encoding apparatus may signal information (residual information) on residual between the original block and the predicted block, rather than an original sample value of an original block, to the decoding apparatus, thereby increasing image coding efficiency.

Here, the residual information may include value information of the quantized transform coefficients, location information, a transform technique, a transform kernel, a quantization parameter, and the like.

This may be applied/expressed in other parts of this document as well.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The predictor of the encoding apparatus/decoding apparatus may derive prediction samples by performing inter prediction in units of blocks. Inter prediction can be a prediction derived in a manner that is dependent on data elements (e.g. sample values or motion information, etc) of picture(s) other than the current picture. When the inter prediction is applied to the current block, based on the reference block (reference sample arrays) specified by the motion vector on the reference picture pointed to by the reference picture index, the predicted block (prediction sample arrays) for the current block can be derived. In this case, in order to reduce the amount of motion information transmitted in the inter prediction mode, the motion information of the current block may be predicted in units of blocks, subblocks, or samples based on the correlation between the motion information between neighboring blocks and the current block. The motion information may include the motion vector and the reference picture index. The motion information may further include inter prediction type (L0 prediction, L1 prediction, Bi prediction, etc.) information. When the inter prediction is applied, the neighboring blocks may include a spatial neighboring block existing in the current picture and a temporal neighboring block existing in the reference picture. The reference picture including the reference block and the reference picture including the temporal neighboring block may be the same or different. The temporal neighboring block may be called a collocated reference block, a collocated CU (colCU), etc., and a reference picture including the temporally neighboring block may be called a collocated picture (colPic). For example, a motion information candidate list may be constructed based on neighboring blocks of the current block, and a flag or index information indicating which candidate is selected (used) to derive the motion vector and/or the reference picture index of the current block may be signaled. The inter prediction may be performed based on various prediction modes. For example, in the skip mode and the merge mode, the motion information of the current block may be the same as the motion information of a selected neighboring block. In the skip mode, unlike the merge mode, a residual signal may not be transmitted. In the case of a motion vector prediction (MVP) mode, a motion vector of a selected neighboring block may be used as a motion vector predictor, and a motion vector difference may be signaled. In this case, the motion vector of the current block may be derived using the sum of the motion vector predictor and the motion vector difference.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The motion information may include L0 motion information and/or L1 motion information according to an inter prediction type (L0 prediction, L1 prediction, Bi prediction, etc.). A motion vector in the L0 direction may be referred to as an L0 motion vector or MVL0, and a motion vector in the L1 direction may be referred to as an L1 motion vector or MVL1. The prediction based on the L0 motion vector may be called L0 prediction, the prediction based on the L1 motion vector may be called the L1 prediction, and the prediction based on both the L0 motion vector and the L1 motion vector may be called a bi-prediction. Here, the L0 motion vector may indicate a motion vector associated with the reference picture list L0 (L0), and the L1 motion vector may indicate a motion vector associated with the reference picture list L1 (L1). The reference picture list L0 may include pictures that are previous than the current picture in output order as reference pictures, and the reference picture list L1 may include pictures that are subsequent than the current picture in output order. The previous pictures may be called forward (reference) pictures, and the subsequent pictures may be called backward (reference) pictures. The reference picture list L0 may further include pictures that are subsequent than the current picture in output order as reference pictures. In this case, the previous pictures may be indexed first, and the subsequent pictures may be indexed next in the reference picture list L0. The reference picture list L1 may further include pictures previous than the current picture in output order as reference pictures. In this case, the subsequent pictures may be indexed first in the reference picture list 1 and the previous pictures may be indexed next.

As described above, the in-loop filtering may be performed by the filter of the encoding apparatus and the filter of the decoding apparatus, and a deblocking filter, SAO, and/or adaptive loop filter (ALF) may be applied. For example, the ALF process may be performed after the deblocking filtering process and/or the SAO process are completed. However, even in this case, the deblocking filtering process and/or the SAO process may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Hereinafter, picture reconstruction and filtering will be described in detail. In image/video coding, a reconstructed block may be generated based on intra prediction/inter prediction in each block unit, and a reconstructed picture including the reconstructed blocks may be generated. When the current picture/slice is an I picture/slice, blocks included in the current picture/slice may be reconstructed based on only intra prediction. Meanwhile, when the current picture/slice is a P or B picture/slice, blocks included in the current picture/slice may be reconstructed based on intra prediction or inter prediction. In this case, intra prediction may be applied to some blocks in the current picture/slice, and inter prediction may be applied to the remaining blocks.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The intra prediction may represent a prediction for generating prediction samples for the current block based on reference samples in the picture (hereinafter, current picture) to which the current block belongs. In case that the intra prediction is applied to the current block, neighboring reference samples to be used for the intra prediction of the current block may be derived. The neighboring reference samples of the current block may include a sample adjacent to a left boundary of the current block having a size of nW&#xd7;nH, total 2&#xd7;nH samples neighboring the bottom-left, a sample adjacent to the top boundary of the current block, total 2&#xd7;nW samples neighboring the top-right, and one sample neighboring the top-left of the current block. Alternatively, the neighboring reference samples of the current block may include top neighboring sample of plural columns and left neighboring sample of plural rows. Alternatively, the neighboring reference samples of the current block may include total nH samples adjacent to the right boundary of the current block having a size of nW&#xd7;nH, total nH samples adjacent to the right boundary of the current block, total nW samples adjacent to the bottom boundary of the current block, and one sample neighboring the bottom-right of the current block.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">However, some of the neighboring reference samples of the current block may have not yet been decoded or may not be available. In this case, the decoder may configure the neighboring reference samples to be used for the prediction through substitution of available samples for the unavailable samples. Alternatively, the neighboring reference samples to be used for the prediction may be configured through interpolation of the available samples.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">When neighboring reference samples are derived, there are two cases, that is, a case (i) in which a prediction sample may be derived based on an average or interpolation of neighboring reference samples of a current block, and a case (ii) in which the prediction sample may be derived based on a reference sample present in a specific (prediction) direction for the prediction sample among the neighboring reference samples of the current block. The case (i) may be called a non-directional mode or a non-angular mode, and the case (ii) may be called a directional mode or an angular mode. In addition, the prediction sample may also be generated through a first neighboring sample and a second neighboring sample located in a direction opposite to the prediction direction of the intra prediction mode of the current block based on the prediction sample of the current block among the neighboring reference samples. The above case may be referred to as linear interpolation intra prediction (LIP). In addition, chroma prediction samples may be generated based on luma samples by using a linear model. This case may be called an LM mode. In addition, a temporary prediction sample of the current block may be derived based on filtered neighboring reference samples. At least one reference sample, which is derived according to the intra prediction mode among the existing neighboring reference samples, that is, unfiltered neighboring reference samples, and the temporary prediction sample may be weighted-summed to derive the prediction sample of the current block. The above case may be called a position dependent intra prediction (PDPC). In addition, a reference sample line having the highest prediction accuracy among the neighboring multiple reference sample lines of the current block may be selected to derive the prediction sample by using the reference sample located in the prediction direction on the corresponding line, and the reference sample line used herein may be indicated (signaled) to a decoding apparatus, thereby performing intra-prediction encoding. The above case may be called multi-reference line (MRL) intra prediction or MRL-based intra prediction. In addition, intra prediction may be performed based on the same intra prediction mode by dividing the current block into vertical or horizontal sub-partitions, and neighboring reference samples may be derived and used in units of the sub-partitions. That is, in this case, the intra prediction mode for the current block is equally applied to the sub-partitions, and the intra prediction performance may be improved in some cases by deriving and using the neighboring reference samples in units of the sub-partitions. Such a prediction method may be called intra sub-partitions (ISP) or ISP-based intra prediction. The aforementioned intra prediction methods may be called an intra prediction type distinct to the intra prediction mode in the sections 1.2. The intra prediction type may be called in various terms such as an intra prediction technique or an additional intra prediction mode or the like. For example, the intra prediction type (or additional intra prediction mode or the like) may include at least one of the aforementioned LIP, PDPC, MRL, and ISP. A general intra prediction method except for the specific intra prediction type such as LIP, PDPC, MRL, or ISP may be called a normal intra prediction type. The normal intra prediction type may be generally applied when the specific intra prediction type is not applied, and prediction may be performed based on the aforementioned intra prediction mode. Meanwhile, optionally, post-processing filtering may be performed on the derived prediction sample.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Specifically, the intra prediction process may include an operation of determining an intra prediction mode/type, an operation of deriving a neighboring reference sample, and an operation of deriving a prediction sample based on the intra prediction mode/type. In addition, optionally, a post-processing filtering operation may be performed on the derived prediction sample.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A modified reconstructed picture may be generated through the in-loop filtering process, and the modified reconstructed picture may be output as a decoded picture in the decoding apparatus and may also be stored in a decoded picture buffer or memory of the encoding apparatus/decoding apparatus and used as a reference picture in the inter prediction process when the picture is encoded/decoded at a later time. The in-loop filtering process may include a deblocking filtering process, a sample adaptive offset (SAO) process, and/or an adaptive loop filter (ALF) process as described above. In this case, one or some of the deblocking filtering process, SAO process, ALF process, and bi-lateral filter process may be sequentially applied, or all of the processes may be sequentially applied. For example, the SAO process may be performed after the deblocking filtering process is applied to the reconstructed picture. Alternatively, for example, the ALF process may be performed after the deblocking filtering process is applied to the reconstructed picture. This may also be equally performed in the encoding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The deblocking filtering is a filtering technique which removes distortion occurring at boundaries between blocks in the reconstructed picture. The deblocking filtering process may, for example, derive a target boundary in the reconstructed picture, determine a boundary strength (bS) for the target boundary, and perform deblocking filtering on the target boundary, based on the bS. The bS may be determined based on a prediction mode, a motion vector difference, whether reference pictures are identical, whether a non-zero significant coefficient exists, etc., of two blocks adjacent to the target boundary.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The SAO is a method in which an offset difference between the reconstructed picture and the original picture is compensated on a sample basis. For example, the SAO may be applied based on a type such as a band offset, an edge offset, or the like. According to the SAO, samples may be classified into different categories according to each SAO type, and an offset value may be added to each sample, based on the category. Filtering information for the SAO may include information on whether the SAO is applied, SAO type information, SAO offset value information, or the like. The SAO may be applied to the reconstructed picture after the deblocking filtering is applied.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The ALF is a technique for filtering the reconstructed picture on a sample basis, based on filter coefficients according to a filter shape. The encoding apparatus may determine whether the ALF is applied, an ALF shape, and/or an ALF filtering coefficient or the like by comparing the reconstructed picture and the original picture, and may signal the determination result to the decoding apparatus. That is, the filtering information for the ALF may include information on whether the ALF is applied, ALF filter shape information, ALF filtering coefficient information, or the like. The ALF may be applied to the reconstructed picture after the deblocking filtering is applied.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of an ALF filter shape.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, (a) illustrates a 7&#xd7;7 diamond filter shape, and (b) illustrates a 5&#xd7;5 diamond filter shape.

In the present document, a location and/or unit in which the filter coefficient is allocated according to the ALF filter shape may be called a filter tap. In this case, one filter coefficient may be allocated to each filter tap, and a shape in which the filter tap is arranged may correspond to a filter shape. A filter tap located at a center of the filter shape may be called a center filter tap. The same filter coefficient may be allocated to two filter taps having the same value n and present at locations corresponding to each other with respect to the center filter tap. For example, in case of the 7&#xd7;7 diamond filter shape, 25 filter taps are included, and filter coefficients C<b>0</b> to C<b>11</b> are allocated in a central symmetric shape. Therefore, filter coefficients may be allocated to the 25 filter taps by using only 13 filter coefficients. In addition, for example, in case of the 5&#xd7;5 diamond filter shape, 13 filter taps are included, and filter coefficients C<b>0</b> to C<b>5</b> are allocated in the central symmetric shape. Therefore, filter coefficients may be allocated to the 13 filter taps by using only 7 filters. For example, in order to decrease a data amount of information on filter coefficients to be signaled, 12 filter coefficients out of the 13 filter coefficients for the 7&#xd7;7 diamond filter shape may be (explicitly) signaled, and one filter coefficient may be (implicitly) derived. In addition, for example, 6 filter coefficients out of the 7 filter coefficients for the 5&#xd7;5 diamond filter shape may be (explicitly) signaled, and one filter coefficient may be (implicitly) derived.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a virtual boundary applied to a filtering process according to an embodiment of the present document.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a virtual boundary may be a line defined by shifting a horizontal CTU boundary by N samples.

The HLS may include the SPS, the PPS, the picture header, the slice header, or the like as described above.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Hereinafter, a high-level syntax signaling and semantics will be described according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">An embodiment of the present document may include a method of controlling loop filters. The present method for controlling the loop filters may be applied to a reconstructed picture. In-loop filters (loop filters) may be used for decoding of encoded bitstreams. The loop filters may include the aforementioned deblocking, SAO, and ALF. The SPS may include flags related to each of the deblocking, SAO, and ALF. The flags may indicate whether each of tools is available for the coding of a coded layer video sequence (CLVS) or coded video sequence (CVS) referring to the SPS.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">When the loop filters are available for the CVS, the applying of the loop filters may be controlled not to be across specific boundaries. For example, whether the loop filters are across sub-picture boundaries may be controlled. In addition, whether the loop filters are across tile boundaries may be controlled. In addition thereto, whether the loop filters are across virtual boundaries may be controlled. Herein, the virtual boundaries may be defined on CTUs based on availability of a line buffer.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Regarding whether the in-loop filtering process is performed across the virtual boundary, in-loop filtering-related information may include at least one of an SPS virtual boundaries enabled flag (a virtual boundaries enabled flag in an SPS), an SPS virtual boundaries present flag, a picture header virtual boundaries present flag, an SPS picture header virtual boundaries present flag, and information on a virtual boundaries position.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In embodiments included in the present document, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include information on an x-coordinate of a vertical virtual boundary and/or information on a y-coordinate of a horizontal virtual boundary. Specifically, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include the information on the x-coordinate of the vertical virtual boundary and/or the information on the y-axis of the horizontal virtual boundary in units of luma samples. In addition, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include information on the number of pieces of information (syntax elements) on the x-coordinate of the vertical virtual boundary which is present in the SPS. In addition, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include information on the number of pieces of information (syntax elements) on the y-coordinate of the horizontal virtual boundary which is present in the SPS. Alternatively, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include information on the number of pieces of information (syntax elements) on the x-coordinate of the vertical virtual boundary which is present in a picture header. In addition, the information on the virtual boundaries position may include information on the number of pieces of information (syntax elements) on the y-coordinate of the horizontal virtual boundary which is present in the picture header.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The following tables show an exemplary syntax and semantics of an SPS according to the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="168pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Descriptor</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>seq_parameter_set_rbsp( ) {</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;...</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;subpics_present_flag</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;if( subpics present flag ) {</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;sps_num_subpics_minus1</entry><entry>u(8)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;for( i = 0; i &#x3c;= sps_num_subpics_minus1; i++ ) {</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;subpic_ctu_top_left_x[ i ]</entry><entry>u(v)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;subpic_ctu_top_left_y| i ]</entry><entry>u(v)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;subpic_width_minus1[ i ]</entry><entry>u(v)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;subpic_height_minus1[ i ]</entry><entry>u(v)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;subpic_treated_as_pic_flag[ i ]</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;loop_filter_across_subpic_enabled_flag[ i ]</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;}</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;}</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;...</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;sps_sao_enabled_flag</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;sps_alf_enabled_flag</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;...</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;sps_loop_filter_across_virtual_boundaries_disabled_</entry><entry>u(1)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;present_flag</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;if( sps_loop_filter_across_virtual_boundaries_</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;disabled_present flag ) {</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;sps_num_ver_virtual_boundaries</entry><entry>u(2)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;for( i = 0; i &#x3c; sps_num_ver_virtual_boundaries; </entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;i++ )</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;sps_virtual_boundaries_pos_x[ i ]</entry><entry>u(13)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;sps_num_hor_virtual_boundaries</entry><entry>u(2)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;for( i = 0; i &#x3c; sps_num_hor_virtual_boundaries; </entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;i++ )</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;sps_virtual_boundaries_pos_y[ i ]</entry><entry>u(13)</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2003;}</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>&#x2003;...</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>}</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0142" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="364pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>subpics_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that subpicture parameters are present in in the SPS RBSP syntax.</entry></row><row><entry>subpics_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that subpicture parameters are not present in the SPS RBSP syntax.</entry></row><row><entry>sps_num_subpics_minusl plus 1 specifies the number of subpictures. sps_num_subpics_minus1 shall be in the range of 0</entry></row><row><entry>to 254.
