The outer shell is made of steel and the rubber bladder is disposed in the outer shell. According to Boyle's law PV=C, if the volume of the air in the bladder-type pressure tank decreases, the air pressure increases and the water flows in until the water pressure is equal to the air pressure in the bladder-type pressure tank. When the water flows out and the water pressure decreases, the air pressure in the bladder-type pressure tank is greater than the water pressure. Thus, the air expands to extrude the water in the bladder-type pressure tank until the air pressure and the water pressure are balanced. The bladder-type pressure tank is mainly used to buffer pressure fluctuations in a pipeline system and provide water to the pipeline. However, conventional bladder-type pressure tanks include steel outer shells and rubber bladders. The steel outer shells are corrosive, and the rubber bladders are fragile.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One objective of the disclosure is to provide a bladder-type pressure tank; the bladder-type pressure tank comprises an outer shell, a bladder, a nozzle, and an elbow pipe; the outer shell comprises a liner and a glass-fiber layer covering an outer surface of the liner; the liner comprises polyethylene (PE); the liner further comprises a chamber, a first opening, and a second opening; the bladder is disposed in the chamber; in an inflated state of the bladder, a gap is formed between the inflated bladder and an inner surface of the liner; the bladder comprises polyurethane (PU); the nozzle is integrated with the bladder, and is disposed in the first opening and seals the first opening; the elbow pipe comprises a first end and a second end; the first end of the elbow pipe is disposed in the second opening and communicates with the chamber; and the second end of the elbow pipe is configured to connect to a pipeline.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a class of this embodiment, the bladder-type pressure tank further comprises a fixing column integrated with the bladder; the first end of the elbow pipe comprises a fixing plate; and the fixing column is fixedly disposed through the fixing plate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a class of this embodiment, the first end of the elbow pipe further comprises a step; and the fixing plate is clamped in the step.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a class of this embodiment, the fixing column is integrally formed with the bladder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a class of this embodiment, the second opening comprises a female thread; the first end of the elbow pipe comprises a first male thread; and the first end is embedded in the second opening through the matching of the first male thread and the female thread.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a class of this embodiment, the first opening is disposed in a top part of the liner; the second opening is disposed in a bottom part of the liner; and the bladder-type pressure tank further comprises a saddle support fixedly disposed at a bottom portion of the outer shell to support the outer shell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a class of this embodiment, the second opening is surrounded by a flange; the saddle support comprises a fixing sleeve; and the fixing sleeve is fixedly disposed on the flange.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a class of this embodiment, the bladder-type pressure tank further comprises a seal gasket disposed in the first opening; and the nozzle is disposed through the first opening and fixedly connected to the seal gasket by at least one bolt.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a class of this embodiment, the outer shell has a maximum working pressure of 1.0 megapascal; and the bladder has a maximum working pressure of 0.2 megapascal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a class of this embodiment, in the inflated state, a distance between the inflated bladder and the inner surface of the liner is between 4.5 and 5.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another objective of the disclosure is to provide a preparation method of the bladder-type pressure tank, the method comprising: preparing the bladder by blow molding; integrally forming the nozzle with the bladder by injection molding; preparing the liner comprising the first opening and the second opening using an injection molding process; wrapping glass fiber around the outer surface of the liner to form the outer shell; fixedly disposing the bladder in an uninflated state in the liner; fixedly disposing the nozzle on the liner through the first opening; fixedly disposing the elbow pipe in the second opening; pumping inert gas through the nozzle to the bladder; and connecting the elbow pipe to the pipeline.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following advantages are associated with the bladder-type pressure tank of the disclosure: the liner comprises high-density polyethylene (HDPE).
