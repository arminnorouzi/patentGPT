The rotational phase shift between opposite ends of the mast is caused by twisting of the helicopter mast. Measurements of the phase shift during operation determine how much twist is imparted to the mast, and this twist can be related to torsional load on the mast. Traditionally, to calibrate the phase shift measurements, such measurement must be obtained while the shaft is rotating. This requires many key components of the mast to be removed to create a zero-load condition (i.e., no torque). The removal of such components adds maintenance cost and time to create the zero torque conditions. Additionally, in the case of measuring tail rotor torque, turning a main rotor without having a tail rotor available may lead to a safety hazard since the tail rotor counteracts torque that may be generated from the main rotor. Without a tail rotor, the aircraft may start to rotate in the opposite direction of the main rotor rotation.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments are directed to systems and methods for calibrating a torque measurement system. A reference operating condition is used to conduct a calibration without requiring zero torque. A torque model that accounts for operational conditions and atmospheric conditions provides a precise estimation of the torque at this condition. This saves both cost and time and improves safety by avoiding the need to remove rotors to achieve a zero-torque condition.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A torque measurement system determines torque on a shaft by monitoring angular deflection of the shaft under load using phase shift measurements.

Like rotorcraft <b>100</b>, in tiltrotor aircraft <b>201</b> a torque meter may be used to monitor the torque applied to drive shafts <b>210</b>. In existing tiltrotor torque transmissions, interconnect drive shafts send torque from one proprotor to another in case of an engine failure. Torque on these interconnect drive shafts may also be monitored by a torque meter.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a system for measuring torque according to an example embodiment. A drive shaft <b>301</b>, such as a helicopter main rotor or tail rotor driveshaft or mast, couples a gearbox output <b>302</b> to a rotor system <b>303</b>. In other embodiments, for example, a drive shaft <b>301</b> may couple an engine output <b>302</b> to a gearbox input <b>303</b>. Output <b>302</b> rotates and applies a load to drive shaft <b>301</b>, which rotates in turn and transfers the load to input <b>303</b>. As the load on drive shaft <b>301</b> increases, the shaft may twist as the rotation of end <b>303</b> begins to lag the rotation of the end <b>302</b>. The rotation of each end of drive shaft <b>301</b> can be monitored using a tachometer, for example. A first tachometer <b>304</b> determines the change in rotational position of a first target <b>305</b> on a first end of drive shaft <b>301</b>, and a second tachometer <b>306</b> determines the change in rotational position of a second target <b>307</b> on a second end of drive shaft <b>301</b>. Signals from tachometers <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> are provided to a processor <b>308</b> for analysis.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A phase-based measurement system is typically used to determine the change in the position of targets <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> passing tachometers <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> using a proximity-type sensor, such as a monopole or Variable Reluctance (VR) sensor. Measurements from each end are used to determine how much twist is imparted to the drive shaft <b>301</b>, and this twist can be related to torsional load. A processor <b>308</b> can receive signals from sensors <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, such as a first tachometer voltage <b>309</b> and a second tachometer voltage <b>310</b>. The tachometer voltages <b>309</b>, <b>310</b> show a voltage signal progression as a target <b>305</b>, <b>307</b> moves past its respective sensor <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>. Multiple, equally spaced targets <b>305</b>, <b>307</b> on the rotating drive shaft <b>301</b> create repetitions of the voltage waveforms <b>309</b>, <b>310</b>, which can be used to determine the mast's rotational speed. As the rotating target <b>305</b> approach the sensor <b>304</b>, the voltage rises to a peak positive voltage and then drops to a peak negative voltage as the target <b>305</b> moves away from the sensor <b>304</b>. When the target <b>305</b> and sensor <b>304</b> are aligned, voltage waveform <b>309</b> is at zero crossing <b>309</b>. The second tachometer voltage has similar zero crossings waveform <b>310</b>. Typically, there is an angular offset between sensor targets <b>305</b>, <b>307</b> on either end of the drive shaft <b>301</b>. As a result, even when there is no torque on drive shaft <b>301</b>, there is a phase shift (or a time offset) between reference points on the sensor waveforms <b>309</b>, <b>310</b> as illustrated at zero crossings <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>. As a load is applied to drive shaft <b>301</b>, torque causes drive shaft <b>301</b> to twist and, therefore, a delay is created in the second voltage waveform <b>310</b>. The amount of delay can be measured by determining the change in the zero crossings from time <b>312</b> to time <b>313</b>. When the drive shaft <b>301</b> is under torque, it will twist over the length of the shaft, such that features/targets at the aft sensor (tachometer) will pass the fixed sensor position later than they would if the shaft not been under torque. The phase shift <b>314</b> between the first end and the second with no torque increases to phase shift <b>315</b> when torque is applied.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate an alternative system for measuring torque using an interlaced teeth torque meter <b>320</b>.

A witness tube <b>324</b> is fixedly attached to the gearbox end <b>325</b> of drive shaft <b>322</b>. Witness tube <b>324</b> rotates with, and at the same speed as, gearbox input pinion <b>323</b>.

When one of the teeth <b>327</b> or <b>328</b> moves close to monopole <b>329</b>, the magnetic flux of the monopole <b>329</b> changes, which creates a voltage signal or pulse that can be fed to a processor <b>330</b> or other circuitry. The voltage signal can be analyzed or processed to measure the how fast the pulses are occurring, which corresponds to the rotational speed or angular velocity of engine output shaft <b>321</b>, drive shaft <b>322</b>, and gearbox input pinion <b>323</b>. The voltage signal can be analyzed or processed to measure the time between the pulses, which corresponds to the angular displacement (i.e., gap) between teeth <b>327</b> and <b>328</b>. As the angular displacement between teeth <b>327</b> and <b>328</b> is reduced, the time between pulses is also reduced. This change in angular displacement indicates that drive shaft <b>322</b> is twisting so that witness tube <b>324</b> (and gearbox input pinion <b>323</b>) is moving angularly relative to engine output shaft <b>321</b>. The gap between teeth <b>327</b> and <b>328</b> may be calibrated to torque in drive shaft <b>322</b>. This would allow processor <b>330</b> to determine the gap between teeth at any time and then create an output indicating the current torque load on drive shaft <b>322</b>. This torque measurement may be displayed on an instrument panel, for example.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Torsional measurements are essential in many rotorcraft applications. Torque measurement is accomplished on rotating shafts by determining the amount of twist in the shaft and relating that to the shaft's torsional stiffness. Assuming that the torsional stiffness of a shaft can be measured or estimated in a static environment, then only the twist angle of the shaft needs to be measured to determine the current torque. The twist angle may be determined using the phase-based measurements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>. A current phase shift <b>314</b> or <b>315</b> across the shaft can then be correlated to a degree of twist and, therefore, to a torque.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the twist of the shaft is typically small, such as on the order of a few degrees, and since precise angular tolerancing of the sensor targets would be costly and impractical to achieve, known methods calibrate for phase shift through direct measurement of the drive shaft during a reference condition where torque is known to be zero or when the torque load is completely removed. Typically, this has been achieved in rotorcraft by removing rotor blades and hub components and then free spinning the shaft under an unloaded condition.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An example calibration curve is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Phase shift is measure in terms of time or delay, which can be used to calculate torque. Since drive shafts are operated in their elastic range, Hooke's Law states that the relationship between load and deflection is linear. Therefore, only two items are needed to construct the calibration curve <b>401</b>&#x2014;a slope <b>402</b> and a point <b>403</b>. The slope of the calibration line is proportional to the torsional stiffness of the shaft at a given speed. Since the phase shift (&#x3b4;<b>0</b>) is non-zero at zero torque, the offset point <b>403</b> is defined in the existing methods by rotating the drive shaft in an unload condition (i.e., with rotor and hub components removed). Accordingly, a user needs only the torsional stiffness (ktors) and the no-torque phase shift (&#x3b4;<b>0</b>) to create calibration curve <b>401</b>. The prior art approach is effective but presents several problems. First, portions of the system must be disassembled and removed to ensure that a zero-torque condition is created. This involves additional time and cost. Additionally, in the case of measuring tail rotor torque, turning a main rotor without having a tail rotor available may lead to a safety hazard since the tail rotor counteracts torque that may be generated from the main rotor. Without a tail rotor, the aircraft may start to rotate in the opposite direction of the main rotor rotation.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To calibrate a torque measurement system, both a slope and an offset are required. The slope is the torsional stiffness (ktors) of the drive shaft, which is typically determined during manufacture. However, since such a torque measurement system only works when the drive shaft is turning, the offset calibration (i.e., phase shift) must be determined while the shaft is rotating.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the systems and methods for calibrating torque measurements as disclosed herein improve on prior methods by replacing the zero-torque condition with a condition that has a known, non-zero torque. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an offset point <b>503</b> corresponding to a non-zero reference torque (Qref) replaces the zero-torque condition used in prior methods. To determine the offset calibration values of Qref and &#x3b4;ref, which are then applied to the calculation of torque, the following steps are used: (1) a reference operating condition in which the shaft rotates is defined, (2) the torque at this reference condition is estimated based on aerodynamic knowledge of the rotors that are coupled to the shaft, (3) the shaft is then operated in the reference condition, (4) sensor data is captured to determine the phase difference at the operating condition, and (5) the phase difference and estimated torque are associated and used as a calibration value to enable calculation of torque in a torque measurement system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first step (i.e., defining a reference operating condition in which the shaft is rotating) involves finding a point at which the speed and torque are relatively constant. A low-torque condition may be used for most applications; however, other conditions may also be applied, such as a rotorcraft hover configuration at a known gross weight. The rotor RPM may be 100% or a slower speed, such as a single-engine idle RPM, may be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the second step, known aircraft parameters are used to estimate the torque at the reference condition. To overcome the uncertainty of determining torque in the reference operating condition, a model of the torque requirement from the rotors in the given operating conditions is established. This model may be empirical (i.e., derived from measurements on an aircraft with an independently calibrated sensor) or analytical (e.g., calculated from an aerodynamic model). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates example aerodynamic models <b>601</b>-<b>603</b> showing rotor power as a function of rotor collective position for different atmospheric conditions. The operating conditions may be, for example, single engine ground idle at approximately 50% rotational speed. In other embodiments, any other appropriate operating conditions may be used. As illustrated, the torque at this operating condition is a function of atmospheric conditions as well as rotor collective pitch angle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, the atmospheric conditions may be normalized by presenting the relationship in terms of referred power (shp/&#x3c3;&#x2032;) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. This allows the effects of atmospheric conditions to be built into the aerodynamic model. Aerodynamic models <b>701</b>-<b>703</b> illustrate referred rotor power as a function of rotor collective position for different atmospheric conditions.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A simplified view of the torque model <b>801</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. This model may be used to generate the estimated torque (Qref) value for the offset point. Inputs to the torque model <b>801</b> include operating conditions <b>802</b>, such as rotational speed and rotor pitch, and atmospheric conditions <b>803</b>, such as air temperature and pressure. These inputs are applied to known aircraft parameters and behaviors in the reference operating condition. The output of the model <b>801</b> is an estimated torque <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the third step, the drive shaft is operated in the reference condition. With the torque model established, this step generates the offset point for use in calculating torque. The pilot or maintenance personnel must be given sufficient information to ensure that the operating condition is met during this step. This may be done using standard or dedicated displays in the cockpit. For example, to meet a specific tail rotor pitch condition (or to ensure operation over a range of conditions), this may involve providing cues for various flight control positions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example display <b>900</b> for use in operating a tail rotor drive shaft in a reference condition for calibration measurements. Display <b>900</b> indicates a target rotational speed (NR) for the main rotor in both digital <b>901</b> and analog <b>902</b> formats. The current main rotor rotational speed is also shown in both digital <b>903</b> and analog <b>904</b> formats. The pilot or maintenance personnel adjust the engine operating parameters to meet the target rotational speed using display <b>900</b>. For example, the pilot adjusts the operating parameters to align the current speed arrow <b>904</b> with the target speed arrow <b>903</b> and then the calibration procedure can proceed. The middle portion of display <b>900</b> shows five desired control positions <b>905</b> that are required to complete a sweep through a range in which minimum torque should exist. An actual position arrow <b>906</b> shows the current control position, and a desired position <b>907</b> shows the configuration that is required for the next step in the calibration process. A pedal position display is shown in the illustrated embodiment, which is useful for calibrating a tail rotor drive shaft. It will be understood that in other embodiments different control positions may be displayed for calibration of other drive shafts. For example, a cyclic position display may be used for calibrating a main rotor drive shaft or a proprotor tilt angle display may be used for calibrating a rotor on a tilt rotor aircraft.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, five target positions are shown; however, it will be understood that in other embodiments, any number of target control positions may be used for calibration. Once the pilot has aligned the actual control position with the desired control position, the corresponding diamond <b>905</b> may flash to show data acquisition and to prompt the pilot to hold that position. Additionally, a counter <b>908</b> or other prompt may indicate how long the control position should be held. After calibration at each desired control position is complete, the desired position indicator <b>907</b> moves to the next target <b>905</b> in turn until all points are complete. Progress and status information <b>909</b> may be displayed as well as calibration values <b>910</b> when the process is complete.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some cases, the rotor pitch may not be precisely known. For example, in most aircraft the control position or the actuator position may be measured; however, the precise relationship between those inputs and the rotor blades' pitch may be subject to installation variations, such as a particular rigging. In the case where a minimum pitch, which corresponds to minimum torque, is desired, the calibration step may involve sweeping through a range of control positions such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In the case of gathering five points of data, the point with the lowest phase shift may be assumed to be the minimum torque point. Alternatively, a curve fit may be used across the five points to more precisely determine the minimum torque. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-D</figref> illustrate different scenarios that may be observed for the relationship between torque and the five control positions used for calibration testing. Curves <b>1001</b>-<b>1004</b> fit the five measured data points for different scenarios. For the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-C</figref>, the lowest measured values <b>1004</b>-<b>1008</b> approximate the minimum torque value for the aircraft across a range of pedal positions. These values can be used to determine the offset point for the calibration curve. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>, the minimum value is at one of the end points <b>1009</b>, which may be flagged as a potential error since the true minimum torque may be outside of the range of control positions used for calibration.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step four of the calibration process, sensor data is captured to determine the phase difference at the operational condition. The data must be captured to determine the actual phase shift (&#x3b4;ref) and to calculate the torque (Qref). Since there may be slight variations in operational conditions during data acquisition, it is desirable to gather data over a period of time, such as a few seconds, to determine an average values of all inputs. Therefore, the value of ref is the average of the offset values measured during the acquisition. Additionally, Qref may be the average of the calculated torque based on the torque model, or it may be calculated based on the average of the inputs to the model.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the final step, the phase difference is associated with an estimated torque and that information is input to the torque measurement system as a calibration value to enable calculation of torque. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the offset point <b>503</b> is determined by identifying the lowest torque value (Qref) across a range of control inputs, such as a range of pedal inputs, which corresponds to a value with the lowest phase shift (&#x3b4;ref) measured across the drive shaft.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Calibration may be affected by the installation and rigging of a drive shaft and/or any attachments to the drive shaft. Therefore, calibration may be repeated after each maintenance event that affects the drive shaft or related components.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since the torsional stiffness of the drive shaft may be influenced by the temperature of the drive shaft, the calibration system may also measure temperature near the drive shaft (or use an outside air temperature) and use temperature as a factor in the calibration determination as well as the calculation of torque.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, machine learning may be used as a regression means to calculate an expected torque based on instrumented and calibrated aircraft, such as in a flight test program. The numerical torque model may be compared to the measured torque as described herein. If the difference between the numerical torque and the measured torque exceeds a threshold in a certain condition, the operator may be prompted to perform a new calibration.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an example embodiment, a method for calibrating a torque measurement system for a drive shaft comprises defining a reference condition in which the drive shaft is rotating, estimating a drive shaft reference torque at the reference condition, operating the drive shaft at the reference condition, capturing sensor data to determine a reference phase shift across the drive shaft at the reference condition, and using the reference torque and the reference phase shift as a pair of calibration values for the torque measurement system. The reference torque may be estimated based upon an aerodynamic model of the drive shaft coupled to a rotor system. The aerodynamic model may define a power required versus blade pitch for the rotor system. The aerodynamic model may be normalized for atmospheric conditions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The drive shaft may be a component of an aircraft, and the reference condition may comprise a rotor system coupled to the drive shaft in a ready-for-flight operating configuration.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The drive shaft may be coupled to a rotor system, where the rotor system is controlled using flight controls.
