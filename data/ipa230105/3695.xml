description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a method for identifying and/or verifying at least one analyte peak in a chromatogram of a sample from a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer device, to a method of quality control applying the aforesaid method, and to systems and computer program products related thereto.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For LC-MS assays, ratios of peak areas are the common way for obtaining calculations or verifications. They are part of several international guidelines for validation of mass spectrometric assays, such as those by the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), the EMA (European Medicines Agency), or the GTFCh (German society for toxicological and forensic chemistry). For the quality assurance of an assay, non-extracted system suitability tests with spiked compounds, measured before the analytical run, have to fulfill acceptance requirements, such as minimal absolute peak areas or maximal retention time deviation from a target value. Within the analytical run, quality control (QC) samples are then tested with a certain frequency and the calculated result checked versus an acceptance range. Moreover, retention time, peak width (given by the retention time difference between the peak boundaries), absolute peak area of the internal standard (ISTD), and the quantifier/qualifier peak area ratio of the analyte are usually monitored in each sample and should fulfill acceptance requirements of maximal deviations or certain cut-offs values. However, most of these parameters are based on peak integration.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Peak boundaries, detection of interferences, and calculation of the result are all directly dependent on the peak integration. However, noisy background (e.g., due to aged MS source) or tailing peaks (e.g., due to aged LC column) can lead to improper peak integration. Determination of peak boundaries is usually defined as the outer points of retention times of the integrated peak and thus consequently affected by improper peak integration. The peak area ratio of two different transitions of the same analyte (e.g., quantifier/qualifier ratio) is used for verifying the peak identity and to exclude interferences. This principle is due to the fact that the peak area ratio of different analyte's transitions deviates around a fixed value which is independent from the analyte concentration. However, this value cannot only be altered by detection artefacts of individual mass transitions, i.e., interferences, but also by improper peak integration. A clear differentiation of both issues is not possible by monitoring these peak area ratios alone and thus frequently requires manual peak review by an expert. In case of the peak areas of the analyte and the internal standard (ISTD), the ratio thereof (analyte/ISTD ratio) leads to the calculation of the result, i.e., the desired concentration. As the result calculation is directly dependent on peak integration, failures thereof will affect the result immediately.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, failures in the peak integration are quite common due to immature integration procedures and these failures cannot automatically be distinguished from the respective system failures. Therefore, manual peak review by an expert is often needed. This peak review on the other hand strongly depends on the experience of the operator and increases human workload. Alternative procedures with parameters independent from the peak integration are therefore desirable for verification.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Nonetheless, there is still a need in the art for means and methods assisting in ensuring correctness of peak identification and result calculation in LC-MS measurements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for identifying and/or verifying at least one analyte peak in a chromatogram of a sample for said analyte from a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer device is provided, said method comprising the following steps: a) determining a chromatogram of the sample by acquiring a plurality of data points for quantifier signal intensities and/or qualifier signal intensities, over time; and, in case the sample comprises an internal standard, optionally acquiring a plurality of data points for internal standard quantifier signal intensities and/or internal standard qualifier signal intensities, over time; b) determining for at least a fraction of the data points acquired in step a), a ratio type selected from the list consisting of (i) analyte quantifier to analyte qualifier ratios, (ii) internal standard quantifier to internal standard qualifier ratios, (iii) analyte quantifier to internal standard quantifier ratios, and (iv) analyte qualifier to internal standard qualifier ratios; c) comparing the ratios determined in step b) to a reference; and d) identifying and/or verifying at least one analyte peak in a chromatogram based on comparison step c).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for identifying and/or verifying at least analyte peak in a chromatogram of a sample comprising an internal standard for said analyte from a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer device, said method comprising the following steps: a) determining a chromatogram of a sample by acquiring a plurality of data points for quantifier signal intensities and, optionally, qualifier signal intensities, over time; b) determining for at least a fraction of the data points acquired in step a), a ratio type selected from the list consisting of (i) analyte quantifier to analyte qualifier ratios, (ii) internal standard quantifier to internal standard qualifier ratios, (iii) analyte quantifier to internal standard quantifier ratios, and (iv) analyte qualifier to internal standard qualifier ratios; c) comparing the ratios determined in step b) to a reference; and d) identifying and/or verifying at least one analyte peak in a chromatogram based on comparison step c).

In an embodiment, the term relates to a device configured for performing a combination of liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometry (MS). Thus, the device, in an embodiment, comprises at least one LC unit, and at least one MS unit, wherein the LC unit and the MS unit are coupled via at least one interface.

The LC may be based on any separation principle deemed appropriate by the skilled person; in an embodiment, the LC is reverse phase chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography, or chiral chromatography; in a further embodiment, the LC is reverse phase chromatography. The LC device may comprise at least one LC column. For example, the LC device may be a single-column LC device or a multi-column LC device having a plurality of LC columns. The LC column may have a stationary phase through which a mobile phase is pumped in order to separate and/or elute and/or transfer the analyte(s) of interest.

In an embodiment, the term relates to a correlation plot of a quantitative measure of one or more signals obtained from a sample by an MS detector with the progress of a chromatographic separation, in an embodiment over time, e.g., retention time and/or elution volume. In an embodiment, said quantitative measure of signal(s) correlates with the concentration of at least part of sample constituents, in particular with the analyte or the internal standard; thus, the quantitative measure of signals may in particular be a signal intensity.

For verifying the peak boundaries, the five consecutive single cycle ratios around the detected peak boundaries of 8,078 and 12,590 ms for benzoylecgonine, 11,956 and 18,557 ms for clonazepam, and 43,664 and 56,774 ms for EDDP were monitored. The numbers of smoothed data points, meeting the acceptance range of &#xb1;30% error of the target value, were counted. A number of at least three out of five data points within the acceptance range led to verification. The peak boundaries determined by peak integration could all be verified, except for the peak start boundary of benzoylecgonine which differed significantly.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0188">Example 3: The significant deviation of the peak start boundary for benzoylecgonine in Example 2 with the high alteration of the quantifier/qualifier single cycle ratios within this measure led to the assumption of an underlying interference by a co-eluting compound near the peak start boundary. Such a co-eluting interference could not be monitored by any peak shape parameter as it did not obviously affect the peak curve. Nevertheless, the medians of the single cycle ratios within the peak boundaries, which were calculated in addition, could verify interference close to peak start by comparison to the respective target value.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0189">Example 4: The analyte/ISTD single cycle ratios were determined and the medians thereof within the peak boundaries were calculated. In comparison to the peak area ratios determined by peak integration, the amounts determined for all compound could be verified except for benzoylecgonine. This result again led to the assumption of an interfering substance under the peak of benzoylecgonine and was thus in line with the assumption described in Example 3. This interference directly affects the final result, i.e., the concentration of benzoylecgonine measured, and cannot not be monitored by traditional parameters, including the quantifier/qualifier peak area ratio, causing a risk of overlooking the interference.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0190">Example 5: Serum samples spiked with a mixture containing testosterone and epitestosterone as well as the ISTD (internal standard) testosterone-13C3 were measured by LC-MS in six different LC-protocols and six analytical replicates. The single data points were read from MS raw data and retention times of the transitions were aligned for the analyte/ISTD combination.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0191">Example 6: The analyte/ISTD single cycle ratio skewness of Example 5 were calculated and monitored for verifying peak identity and/or purity of the samples. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a skewness blot of the analyte/ISTD single cycle ratios for testosterone in different peak resolutions of the isobaric interference epitestosterone together with the respective target value and accepted ranges. Skewness values meeting the acceptance range of &#xb1;100% error of the target value led to verification. The peak identity and/or purity could be verified for samples measured in LC protocol one, two and three. For samples measured in LC protocol four, five and six, the skewness values were out of acceptance range and thus, peak identity and/or purity could not be verified in those samples.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0192">Example 7: The samples not verified in Example 6 by deviating analyte/ISTD single cycle ratio skewness in their distribution led to the assumption of an underlying interference by a co-eluting compound. In addition, the mean peak resolutions between testosterone and epitestosterone (as interference) were estimated for each LC-protocol and sample. In all samples with mean peak resolutions equal or above 0.9, the peak identity and/or purity could be verified by the corresponding skewness, in those samples with values below 0.9, the peak identity and/or purity could not be verified. These observations confirmed the assumption of the presence of an co-eluting interference, in this example epitestosterone, in those samples.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
