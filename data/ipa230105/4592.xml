In the local terminal of the viewer, the viewer can usually see his or her posted comments instantly, but for the terminals of other users who are watching the same video, the bullet-screen comments are usually displayed in sequence according to the sorting order of the bullet-screen comments. In this sorting method, the bullet-screen comments sent by users at a certain time can only be seen by other users after waiting for a certain sorting time, resulting in the latest bullet-screen comments not being displayed in a timely manner, and even causing a serious disconnect between the bullet-screen comments playing and the video content at the moment of sending the bullet-screen comments, reducing the display effect of the bullet-screen comments and affecting the user's experience of using the &#x201c;bullet screen&#x201d; feature.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A method for sorting video bullet-screen comments provided by the present disclosure may be applied in an application environment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A terminal <b>110</b> can communicate with a server <b>120</b> and receive video data as well as bullet-screen data from the server <b>120</b>.

The method may be applied in the terminal <b>110</b> and may include the following steps, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Step S<b>202</b>, obtaining sorting data of a bullet-screen comment in a video, the sorting data including playback progress time of the video and sending time of the bullet-screen comment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When a user sends bullet-screen content, the corresponding bullet-screen data (or bullet-screen comments) can be generated. The bullet-screen comment may include the information content about the bullet-screen comment itself, such as the content of bullet-screen comment 1 being &#x201c;trigger warning&#x201d;. In the embodiments of the present embodiment, the data information related to the bullet-screen comment can also be obtained, such as the playback progress information of the video when the bullet-screen comment is sent, the time when the bullet-screen comment is sent, etc. The playback progress information can indicate the playback progress of the video at the time of sending the bullet-screen comment, which can be collectively referred to as the playback progress time for the sake of description. The playback progress time can be regarded as the length of the played video at the time the bullet-screen comment is sent. For example, the playback progress time of the bullet-screen comment 1 is &#x201c;00:00:30&#x201d;, which means that the bullet-screen comment is sent when the video has been played for 30 seconds. The sending time of the bullet-screen comment refers to the time corresponding to the bullet-screen comment when the bullet-screen comment is sent. In one embodiment, the timestamp of the bullet-screen comment when the bullet-screen comment is sent can be used as the sending time of the bullet-screen comment. The sending time of the bullet-screen comment can be relative to the time information of the video, and the precise sending time can be the same as the playback progress time or different. For example, when the accuracy of the sending time of the bullet-screen comment is in milliseconds, the timestamp of bullet-screen comment 2 sent when the playback progress time is &#x201c;00:00:30&#x201d; is &#x201c;00:00:30:40&#x201d;, and the timestamp of bullet-screen comment 3 is &#x201c;00:00:30:50&#x201d;, that is, the sending time of the bullet-screen comment 2 and bullet-screen comment 3 is &#x201c;00:00:30:40&#x201d; and &#x201c;00:00:30:50&#x201d; respectively.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Of course, in other implementations of the present disclosure, the feature data characterizing the sending time of the bullet-screen comment may be obtained based on other processing of the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, such as converting the sending time of the bullet-screen comment into feature data such as an identifier to distinguish different sending time of sending the bullet-screen comments according to the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, and similar implementations also belong to the embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Step S<b>204</b>, obtaining a first sorting score of the bullet-screen comment based on the playback progress time and obtaining a second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment based on the sending time.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment, the first sorting score and the second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment can be obtained by calculating based on the playback progress time and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, respectively. The first sorting score is associated with the playback progress of the video, while the second sorting score is associated with the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, so that the sorting of bullet-screen comments can be separated into two dimensional parts for representation, which is conducive to controlling the sorting result of the bullet-screen comments from different dimensions respectively. The specific first sorting score and the second sorting score may be calculated and obtained according to the playback progress time or the sending time of the bullet-screen comment according to the predefined processing, or the first sorting score can be represented directly using the playback progress time and the second sorting score can be represented directly using the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, or the first sorting score or the second sorting score can be represented by converting the playback progress time or the sending time of the bullet-screen comment into a data format such as binary.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Step S<b>206</b>, obtaining a bullet-screen score based on at least one of the first sorting score and the second sorting score.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">After calculating and obtaining the first sorting score and the second sorting score, the bullet-screen score can be obtained based on at least one of the first sorting score and the second sorting score. In this embodiment, there is no limitation on how to calculate to obtain the bullet-screen score based on at least one of the first sorting score and the second sorting score, and any implementation in which the bullet-screen score of the bullet-screen comment is calculated using at least one of the first sorting score and the second sorting score falls within the scope of the embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, different weights can be set for the first sorting score and the second sorting score, and the weighted scores calculated according to the weights are further processed to obtain the bullet-screen score, e.g., adding up the weighted scores, or combining or splicing the weighted scores using a preset method. For another example, some machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence algorithms, neural network models, etc. can be used to take the first sorting score and the second sorting score as input, and then output the bullet-screen score. In this way, each bullet-screen comment may have corresponding first sorting score and second sorting score, as well as a corresponding bullet-screen score.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that the bullet-screen score described in the embodiments of the present disclosure may include a numerical score expressed in decimal, binary, etc., such as 89, 92, 10010101, etc., and may also be in other data formats expressed using letters, symbols, etc., such as the bullet-screen score may be AA, AB, or A10, B08, etc., which may indicate the size of the bullet-screen score value according to alphabetical order, numerical size, etc. For example, the value of the bullet-screen score AA is greater than the value of the bullet-screen score AB, and the value of the bullet-screen score A10 is greater than the value of the bullet-screen score B08. The bullet-screen score may also be in the data format that includes other settings.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Step S<b>208</b>, determining, based on the bullet-screen score, a sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video can be determined based on the bullet-screen score. The sorting result may represent the order in which the bullet-screen is played in the video, may be sorting data redetermined based on the bullet-screen score, or may be the bullet-screen score itself. For example, a string &#x201c;score&#x201d; may be used to represent the bullet-screen score, which may be specifically obtained based on the first sorting score and second sorting score in a predetermined manner or algorithm. The size of the bullet-screen score itself can reflect the priority of the bullet-screen's playback in the video, e.g., the larger the score is, the higher the playback order will be. For example, a bullet-screen comment with a &#x201c;score&#x201d; of 90 will be displayed in the video before that with a &#x201c;score&#x201d; of 89. It can be understood that the solutions of this embodiment can be achieved to correlate the bullet-screen score with two dimensions, i.e., the playback progress of the video and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, and then the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment can be determined according to the bullet-screen score. After the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment is determined, the server can store the sorting result, such as the score of each bullet-screen comment, and this process is not limited to necessarily include the sorting process or the processing of displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video. As in some implementation scenarios, the server may store the calculated bullet-screen score of each bullet-screen, and set the bullet-screen score to represent the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the solutions of this embodiment of the present disclosure, the playback order of the bullet-screen comment is associated with the playback progress of the video and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, and the bullet-screen score is calculated by the two together to determine the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video, so as to realize the control of the bullet-screen score according to the playback progress and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, which can make the bullet-screen comment be displayed in the video according to the playback progress and the sending time.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the first sorting score and the second sorting score can be calculated and obtained based on the playback progress time and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment respectively, and then the bullet-screen score can be calculated based on the first sorting score and the second sorting score, so that the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment can be determined based on the bullet-screen score. Therefore, the different calculation/processing methods of the bullet-screen score affect the sorting result. In one implementation provided by the present disclosure, the first sorting score is negatively correlated with the playback progress time, and the second sorting score is positively correlated with sending time of the bullet-screen comment. In this way, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, there is not only a correlation between the bullet-screen score and the playback progress time and the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, but also calculation relationships between the playback progress time and the corresponding score and between the sending time of the bullet-screen comment and the corresponding score. Generally, each bullet-screen comment has its corresponding playback progress time when it is sent. In the solutions of this embodiment, when the bullet-screen comments are displayed continuously, the bullet-screen comment with the higher playback progress is more forward in the sorting, thus the priority of this bullet-screen comment should be higher in order to ensure the timeliness of the bullet-screen comments. Therefore, the first sorting score is set in this embodiment to be negatively correlated with the playback progress, i. e. the smaller the play progress time is, the higher the first sorting score will be, and if only the playback progress is considered, the higher the display priority will be; correspondingly, the larger the playback progress time is, the lower the first sorting score will be. Similarly, the second sorting score is positively correlated with the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, i.e., the later the bullet-screen comment is sent (the later the sending time is, the larger the corresponding time value is), the higher the second sorting score will be, further, considering only the sending time of the bullet-screen comment (or the same playback progress), the later the bullet-screen comment is sent, the higher the display priority will be, i.e., newly posted bullet-screen comment will be displayed first.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As previously described, the different calculation/processing methods of the bullet-screen score affect the sorting result. In some other implementations provided by the present disclosure, the bullet-screen score includes a high bit part and a low bit part spliced together, said obtaining a bullet-screen score based on the first sorting score and the second sorting score includes: determining a value of the high bit part of the bullet-screen score based on the first sorting score of the bullet-screen comment and determining a value of the low bit part of the bullet-screen score based on the second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment; and obtaining the bullet-screen score of the bullet-screen comment based on the value of the high bit part and the value of the low bit part.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this embodiment, the bullet-screen score may include two parts, a high bit part and a low bit part, and the bullet-screen score may be composed of the high bit part and the low bit part spliced together. The high bit part and low bit part usually refer to the different weight components formed by dividing the weights of respective characters or bits in the composition of the bullet-screen score. Usually the high bit part is on the left side of the whole data structure of the bullet-screen score, and the low bit part is on the right side of the whole data structure of the bullet-screen score, which is not limited in the present disclosure, and can be set according to the specific data storage method. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a 52-bit double type (double precision floating point type) &#x201c;score&#x201d; can be used to represent the bullet-screen score, where the first 18 bits (high bit part) store the first sorting score obtained based on the playback progress time, with a capacity of 2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}18-1 seconds timestamp of the playback progress, which can hold 72 hours of playback progress (2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}18 s is about 72 hours). The last 34 bits (the low bit part) stores the second sorting score obtained based on the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, and the 34 bits can hold a maximum of 17.1 billion bullet-screen comments (2{circumflex over (&#x2003;)}34&#x2212;1 is about 17.1 billion). The entire 52-bit &#x201c;score&#x201d; is used to represent the bullet-screen score. The data structure of the bullet-screen score of this embodiment is that: a high bit part of a bullet-screen score has a higher weight, and according to the sorting result, the bullet-screen comment will be displayed based on the playback progress in priority; when the playback progress time of bullet-screen comments is the same (the high bit part is the same), these bullet-screen comments are displayed further according to the score of the sending time, so that among the bullet-screen comments corresponding the same playback progress, the bullet-screen comment with higher second sorting score will be ahead of others.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some other embodiments of the present disclosure, said determining, based on the bullet-screen score, a sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video includes: sorting bullet-screen comments in descending order based on first sorting scores of bullet-screen scores. In response to two or more first sorting scores being equal, the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comments in the video is obtained by further sorting bullet-screen comments with an equal first sorting score in descending order according to second sorting scores of the bullet-screen scores.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiment, the sorting result of bullet-screen comments is that the bullet-screen comments are sorted in descending order according to the playback progress of the video in priority. When the playback progress is equal, the bullet-screen comments with the same first sorting score are further sorted in descending order according to the sending time of the bullet-screen comments, so that the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comments in the video is obtained. For example, in some embodiments, the larger the first sorting score is, the more forward the bullet-screen comment will be in the display of the sorting result, and among the bullet-screen comments with the same first sorting score, a bullet-screen comment with a larger second sorting score is more forward. If combined with some of the aforementioned implementations, the smaller the playback progress time is, the higher the first sorting score will be, the larger the corresponding bullet-screen score will be, the larger the overall bullet-screen score will be, and the higher the priority of the bullet-screen comment playback will be. When the playback progress is equal, for example, among the bullet-screen comments with an equal first sorting score of the high 18 bits, a bullet-screen comment with a later sending time has a higher second sorting score, that is, when the bullet-screen comments have the same playback progress, the later the bullet-screen comment is sent, the more forward it will be. In this way, the bullet-screen comments can be displayed according to the playback progress in priority, and when the playback progress is the same, the newly posted bullet-screen comments can be displayed in time (the second sorting score is relatively large).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for sorting video bullet-screen comments illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, after obtaining the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comments in the video, the method further includes: S<b>402</b>, displaying, during playing the video, the bullet-screen comments in the video by selecting the bullet-screen comments in order according to the sorting result.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After determining the sorting result of displaying the bullet-screen comments, if the video is played at the terminal, the bullet-screen comments can be selected for display in order according to the size of the bullet-screen score in the sorting result.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The display described here may be a display performed by the processing equipment that sorts the video bullet-screen comments, or may be a display performed by a terminal after the bullet-screen comment to be displayed is selected and sent to the terminal. In this way, the bullet-screen comments in the video played by the terminal will be displayed according to the playback progress in priority, and when the playback progress is the same, the newly posted bullet-screen comments can be displayed in time (the second sorting score is relatively large) to improve the user viewing and interaction experience.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart for calculating and obtaining a second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, said obtaining a second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment based on the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">S<b>502</b>, obtaining an auto-increment identifier and sending time of previous bullet-screen comment of target bullet-screen comment, the target bullet-screen comment being the bullet-screen comment for which the bullet-screen score is currently calculated.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">S<b>504</b>, calculating a duration from the sending time of the previous bullet-screen comment and the sending time of the target bullet-screen comment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">S<b>506</b>, determining an auto-increment step based on the duration, the auto-increment step being positively correlated with the duration.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">S<b>508</b>, generating an auto-increment identifier of the target bullet-screen comment by adding the auto-increment identifier of the previous bullet-screen comment and the auto-increment step.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">S<b>510</b>, determining the second sorting score based on the generated auto-increment identifier of the target bullet-screen comment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The implementation, provided by the present disclosure for obtaining the second sorting score of the bullet-screen comment, can set an auto-increment identifier (an auto-increment ID, unique identification) for the bullet-screen comment, in which the sending time of the bullet-screen can be used as the auto-increment ID, or the auto-increment ID can be generated after some processing based on the sending time of the bullet-screen comment. The auto-increment ID is usually increased according to the time sequence of the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, i.e., the later the sending time is, the larger the self-increasing ID is. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the time interval between the current bullet-screen comment and the previous bullet-screen comment can be calculated, and the auto-increment step of the auto-increment ID can be determined based on the time interval. After the auto-increment step is obtained, the auto-increment ID of the current bullet-screen comment can be obtained based on the previous auto-increment ID. Usually, the later the bullet-screen comment is sent, the larger the auto-increment ID will be, and the higher the second sorting score will be. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the auto-increment identifier of the bullet-screen comment is obtained based on the sending time of the bullet-screen comment, and the auto-increment identifier is generated by the auto-increment method. The use of a unique auto-increment ID instead of the traditional way of generating a unique identification based on the sending timestamp can effectively solve the problem of duplicate bullet-screen comments with the same sending timestamp, which affects the sorting process, making the sorting efficiency higher and the sorting results more reliable.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Similarly, in the sorting result for displaying the bullet-screen comment, said determining, based on the bullet-screen score, a sorting result for displaying the bullet-screen comment in the video, includes: sorting, in response to two or more first sorting scores being equal, bullet-screen comments with an equal first sorting score in descending order according to the auto-increment identifier. In this way, the sorting result for displaying the bullet-screen comment also avoids the problem of duplicate bullet-screen comments caused by the same sending timestamp which affects the sorting process, making the sorting more efficient and the sorting result more reliable.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It will be understood that each embodiment of the method described above is described in this specification in a progressive manner.
