The ceramic paint band is added for both functional and styling requirements. With respect to the function of the ceramic paint band, the paint band acts as a bonding surface for an adhesive located between the glass panel and the vehicle. The paint band is also typically opaque to act as a protective barrier that prevents ultraviolet (UV) radiation from reaching and degrading the adhesive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When installing the glass panel in the vehicle, a primer may be applied to the ceramic paint band before applying the adhesive. The primer may be applied to the ceramic paint band by a supplier that provides the glass panel to the vehicle manufacturer such that the manufacturer receives glass panels ready for application of the adhesive, or the primer may be applied by the vehicle manufacturer at the manufacturing facility. In either case, if the glass panel has been installed on the vehicle without first confirming that the glass panel has been properly primed, there is unfortunately no way to determine if the primer has been applied after the glass panel has been installed without destroying the glass panel.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of installing a glass panel on a vehicle.

The opaque coating has a plurality of voids provided therein where a material of the opaque coating is absent. The method also includes applying a primer to the opaque coating that is configured for receipt of an adhesive, wherein the plurality of voids serve as a visual guide for application of the primer to the opaque coating.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the first aspect, the plurality of voids may include a first plurality of voids that are spaced apart from and aligned with each other such that a first ring of the first plurality of voids is formed along and proximate an outer edge of the opaque coating, and the plurality of voids may include a second plurality of voids that are spaced apart from and aligned with each other such that a second ring of the second plurality of voids is formed along and proximate an inner edge of the opaque coating.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the first aspect, the first ring and the second ring are spaced apart from each other, and define a primer application path to guide the applying of the primer to the opaque coating.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the first aspect, after application of the primer to the opaque coating, the method may further include determining whether the primer has been correctly applied to the opaque coating by inspecting the glass panel to determine whether the plurality of voids have been covered by the primer.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the first aspect, if some of the voids have not been covered by the primer, the method may further include rejecting the glass panel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the first aspect, if the plurality of voids have been covered by the primer, the method may further include applying the adhesive to the primer and installing the glass panel on a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the first aspect, a center line between the first ring and the second ring may define a location for application of the adhesive to the primer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the first aspect, a color of the primer may match a color of the opaque coating.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the first aspect, the glass panel may be a laminated glass panel or a tempered glass panel.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of installing a glass panel on a vehicle, wherein the glass panel includes an opaque coating formed about a perimeter of the glass panel that includes a plurality of voids where the opaque coating is absent that are spaced apart from and aligned with each other about the perimeter of the glass panel.

Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a vehicle <b>10</b> having a plurality of fixed glass panels <b>12</b> including a windshield <b>14</b>, a quarter-glass panel <b>16</b>, and a rear glass panel (not illustrated). Glass panels <b>12</b> may be laminated glass panels (e.g., when glass panel <b>12</b> forms windshield <b>14</b>), or glass panels <b>12</b> may be tempered glass panels (e.g., when glass panel <b>12</b> forms quarter-glass panel <b>16</b> or rear glass panel (not illustrated)).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example windshield <b>14</b> in an uninstalled state. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a windshield <b>14</b>, it should be understood that a similar configuration may be used on either quarter-glass panel <b>16</b> or a rear glass panel (not illustrated). Regardless, windshield <b>14</b> includes a glass body <b>18</b> having an outer perimeter <b>20</b>. An opaque ceramic paint coating or band <b>22</b> has been applied to the glass body <b>18</b> that extends about perimeter <b>20</b>. While band <b>22</b> has been described as being formed of a ceramic paint, other opaque coatings known to one skilled in the art are contemplated. A width W (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of paint band <b>22</b> may range between two to four inches, although the width W is variable. Paint band <b>22</b> is configured for receipt of an adhesive <b>23</b> that bonds windshield <b>14</b> to vehicle <b>10</b>, in addition to acting as a UV light blocker to prevent degradation of adhesive <b>23</b> when installed on vehicle <b>10</b>. In addition, paint band <b>22</b> includes a plurality of voids <b>24</b>, which are locations where the ceramic paint of paint band <b>22</b> is absent. In the illustrated embodiment, voids <b>24</b> are circle-shaped, but may be any shape desired (e.g., square, oval, triangular, etc.). Voids <b>24</b> may be formed by applying a mask (not illustrated) to glass panel <b>12</b> before forming paint band <b>22</b>. A diameter of voids <b>24</b> may be about two millimeters, which enables voids <b>24</b> to be large enough to serve as a visual indicator and small enough to not be noticed when covered by a primer, as will be described in more detail later. It should be understood, however, that the diameter or size of voids <b>24</b> is variable and may include diameters and sizes greater than or less than two millimeters, as desired.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An outer ring <b>26</b> of voids <b>24</b> travels along and proximate an outer edge <b>28</b> of paint band <b>22</b>. An inner ring <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b> travels along and proximate an inner edge <b>32</b> of paint band <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, voids <b>24</b> of inner ring <b>30</b> may be aligned with the voids <b>24</b> of the outer ring <b>26</b>. Such a configuration, however, is not required. In this regard, the voids <b>24</b> of inner ring <b>30</b> may be staggered relative to the voids <b>24</b> of the outer ring <b>26</b>, if desired.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Before applying adhesive <b>23</b> to paint band <b>22</b> and installing windshield <b>14</b> to vehicle <b>10</b>, a primer <b>34</b> must be applied to paint band <b>22</b>. It is important that primer <b>34</b> be applied to paint band <b>22</b> before applying adhesive <b>23</b> to the paint band <b>22</b> because primer <b>34</b> is formed of a material that reacts with (e.g., cures) the material (e.g., urethane) of the adhesive <b>23</b> to increase the bond strength between the adhesive <b>23</b> and glass panel <b>12</b>. If the primer <b>34</b> is not present, the adhesive bond between the adhesive <b>23</b> and glass panel <b>12</b> will not be satisfactory over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rings <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b> define a path <b>36</b> for application of primer <b>34</b> to paint band <b>22</b>. Specifically, outer ring <b>26</b> of voids <b>24</b> defines a general outer boundary for the primer path <b>36</b> and inner ring <b>30</b> defines a general inner boundary for the primer path <b>36</b> that are spaced apart at a distance such that a centerline <b>38</b> of primer path <b>36</b> lies between the rings <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b>, and such that the distance between the rings <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> enables the voids <b>24</b> to be covered by the primer <b>34</b> after application thereof. The primer <b>34</b> may be black in color, which may match the color of paint band <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">More importantly, if primer <b>34</b> is applied to primer path <b>36</b> correctly, the voids <b>24</b> of each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> will be covered by the primer <b>34</b>, which enables determining whether the primer <b>34</b> has been applied to the paint band <b>22</b> before applying the adhesive <b>23</b> to the paint band <b>22</b>, and also enables determining whether the primer <b>34</b> has been installed properly to paint band <b>22</b>. In other words, when voids <b>24</b> are covered by primer <b>34</b>, the lack of voids <b>24</b> serves as a visual indicator that primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b>, and also serves as a visual indicator that the primer <b>34</b> has been applied correctly. In addition, if primer <b>34</b> is to be manually applied to paint band <b>22</b> by either the supplier or manufacturer, it should be understood that voids <b>24</b> act as a visual guide for application of primer <b>34</b> to paint band <b>22</b>. Alternatively, if primer <b>34</b> is to be applied by an automated process (e.g., by a robot or some other type of mechanical application device) by either the supplier or manufacturer, the voids <b>24</b> may also be used as a visual guide to verify the automated process set-up is correct for application of primer <b>34</b> to paint band <b>22</b>. Moreover, it should be understood that if the glass panels <b>12</b> are provided by a supplier with primer <b>34</b> already attached to paint band <b>22</b>, the presence or lack of voids <b>24</b> may be used as a visual guide by the manufacturer when inspecting one or a plurality of glass panels <b>12</b> before installation on vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A distance between adjacent voids <b>24</b> in each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> may be in the range between one to three inches, but is variable. In addition, a distance between a void <b>24</b> in ring <b>26</b> and a void <b>24</b> in ring <b>30</b> may be in the range of one to three inches, but is variable, may be dependent on a width of paint band <b>22</b>, and should be sufficient to permit adhesive <b>23</b> to be positioned between each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> such that adhesive <b>23</b> will not cover any of the voids <b>24</b> when compressed and spread out between glass panel <b>12</b> and vehicle <b>10</b>. It is not desirable for adhesive <b>23</b> to cover a void <b>24</b> to ensure that adhesive <b>23</b> is not exposed to UV radiation when installed on the vehicle <b>10</b>&#x2014;even if void <b>24</b> is covered by primer <b>34</b>. A greater number of voids <b>24</b> may increase the likelihood that it can be determined whether primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b>, or determined that primer <b>34</b> has been applied correctly to paint band <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate when primer <b>34</b> has been correctly applied to paint band <b>22</b>. As shown in these figures, each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b> has been covered by primer <b>34</b>, which indicates that primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b> along primer path <b>36</b>, and indicates that primer <b>34</b> has been applied correctly along primer path <b>36</b>. Please note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not to scale, and that the thicknesses of paint band <b>22</b>, primer <b>34</b>, and adhesive <b>23</b> have been exaggerated to illustrate a correct application of primer <b>34</b> to paint band <b>22</b> to cover voids <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">While it is desirable that each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b> are entirely covered after application of primer <b>34</b> because this verifies that the primer <b>34</b> has been correctly centered on paint band <b>22</b>, it should be understood that each ring <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b> does not necessarily have to be entirely covered to verify that primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b>. In this regard, the presence of primer <b>34</b> on paint band <b>22</b> can be verified if either of the rings <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> are covered by primer <b>34</b>. In other words, when each ring <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> are covered by primer <b>34</b> it can be verified that primer <b>34</b> is present and correctly applied (centered), and when both rings <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> are not completely covered it can be verified that primer <b>34</b> is present but not correctly applied (not centered). In addition, inasmuch as the application of primer <b>34</b> to paint band <b>22</b> can be an automated process conducted by a robot or some other mechanical automated application process, the coverage of each ring <b>26</b> and <b>30</b> can function as an acceptance criteria for the verification of the automated process (whether conducted by a robot or some or mechanical automated process).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> illustrate windshields <b>14</b> when primer <b>34</b> has been incorrectly applied to paint band <b>22</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, primer <b>34</b> has been applied so as to overlap only outer ring <b>26</b> of voids <b>24</b>. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, primer <b>34</b> has been applied so as to overlap inner ring <b>30</b> of voids <b>24</b>. In either case, it should be understood that the application of primer <b>24</b> to paint band <b>22</b> can be verified. Nonetheless, these windshields <b>14</b> should not be installed on vehicle <b>10</b> because primers <b>24</b> are at locations that are not centered on paint band <b>22</b>, which prevents a guarantee that adhesive <b>23</b> will be positioned on primer <b>34</b> in manner that permits proper reaction (e.g., curing) with primer <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a method of installing a glass panel <b>12</b> on vehicle <b>10</b> will be described. At block <b>100</b>, a glass panel <b>12</b> has either been received from a supplier by the vehicle manufacturer with primer <b>34</b> already applied to paint band <b>22</b> or the glass panel <b>12</b> has been received by the vehicle manufacturer only with paint band <b>22</b> and the primer <b>34</b> needs to be applied to the paint band <b>22</b>. In either case, at block <b>100</b>, it must be determined whether primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b>. This is accomplished by using voids <b>24</b> as a visual indicator. If at least some of the voids <b>24</b> are covered by primer <b>34</b>, it can be determined whether that primer <b>34</b> has been applied to paint band <b>22</b>. If no primer <b>34</b> has been detected, the glass panel <b>12</b> is rejected (block <b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, if primer <b>34</b> has been detected at block <b>100</b>, it must be then be determined whether primer <b>34</b> has been correctly applied to paint band <b>22</b> (block <b>300</b>). If voids <b>24</b> are visible after application of primer <b>34</b>, the glass <b>12</b> is rejected (block <b>200</b>). If no voids <b>24</b> are visible, it is determined that primer <b>34</b> has been correctly applied to primer path <b>36</b> and accepted for application of adhesive <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">After determination that primer <b>34</b> has been correctly applied to primer path <b>36</b>, adhesive <b>23</b> is applied to primer path <b>36</b> including primer <b>34</b> (block <b>400</b>). Then, glass panel <b>12</b> may be installed on vehicle <b>10</b> (block <b>500</b>). The process may then end (block <b>600</b>). It should be understood, however, that vehicle <b>10</b> may be inspected after installation of glass panel <b>12</b> (block <b>700</b>) to determine whether any of the previous steps were omitted. This may be accomplished by shining a light at paint band <b>22</b> of the installed glass panel <b>12</b> to determine whether any voids <b>24</b> are visible (block <b>800</b>) If voids <b>24</b> are visible, vehicle <b>10</b> may be flagged for removal and proper reinstallation of glass panel <b>12</b> (block <b>900</b>). If voids are not visible, it is determined that glass panel <b>12</b> was properly installed and the process may end (block <b>600</b>). By using the above-described method, it can be verified that primer has been applied, and applied correctly, to paint band <b>22</b> prior to application of an adhesive and installation of glass panel <b>12</b> on vehicle <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
