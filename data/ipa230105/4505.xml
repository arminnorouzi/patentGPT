The advantages of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment will be detailed below.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">To increase the capacity of the semiconductor memory device, it is preferable to increase the area occupied by the memory cell array. In this regard, a semiconductor memory device having a bonded structure is known, in which a NAND chip provided with a memory cell array and a CMOS chip provided with peripheral circuits of the memory cell array are formed of separate wafers bonded together.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The bonded structure can increase the area occupied by the memory cell array and can reduce the chip area. In addition, the bonded structure can suppress deterioration of the CMOS circuit by the NAND process including a high-temperature heat treatment when forming a memory cell array. On the other hand, since the bonded structure is formed by adhering two chips having almost the same size, if it is possible to reduce the area of the peripheral circuits relative to the area of the memory cell array, a free space may occur in the CMOS chip CC.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the volume of data handled by a host device increases, the communication speed in the memory system needs to be increased. To increase the communication speed, it is preferable to take into consideration the losses due to bonding wires between the semiconductor memory device and the memory controller or wires in a printed circuit board or the like. Thus, it is preferable to suppress the parasitic components, such as the parasitic resistance, the parasitic capacitance, and the parasitic inductance, to be as small as possible.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Therefore, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, the memory controller <b>3</b> is arranged in the CMOS chip CC. Specifically, the memory controller <b>3</b> and the input/output module <b>10</b> of the semiconductor memory device <b>4</b> are arranged in the CMOS chip CC. With this arrangement, the memory controller <b>3</b> and the semiconductor memory device <b>4</b> are wired in a very short distance in the CMOS chip CC, so that the parasitic components can be suppressed. As a result, the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment can increase the operation frequency, and increase the communication band.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, the memory controller <b>3</b> is arranged in a free space of the CMOS chip CC; therefore, a separate chip on which the memory controller <b>3</b> is arranged may be omitted. Moreover, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, a step of coupling the memory controller <b>3</b> to the semiconductor memory device <b>4</b> is integrated with a step of forming the CMOS chip CC, and a process of manufacturing the memory controller <b>3</b> is integrated with a process of manufacturing the peripheral circuits of the semiconductor memory device <b>4</b>, if applicable. As a result, the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment can reduce the cost involved in the formation or coupling of the memory controller <b>3</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">[1-3] Modifications of First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment may be modified variously. Various modifications will be described below.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">First Modification of First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of an arrangement of components of a memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment differs from the memory system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment in bus width of each of the NAND bus NB, the first internal bus IB<b>1</b>, the second internal bus IB<b>2</b>, and the third internal bus IB<b>3</b>. Specifically, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the NAND bus NB has a 32-bit bus width, the first internal bus IB<b>1</b> has a 32-bit bus width, the second internal bus IB<b>2</b> has a 64-bit bus width, and the third internal bus IB<b>3</b> has a 64-bit bus width. The other configurations in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment are the same as those of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The amount of information that a bus can transmit at a time depends on the bus width. An increase of the bus width may be considered as a method for increasing the communication speed. However, if the bus width is increased, the number of signal lines included in the bus increases, which may increase the area and volume required to mount the bus. For example, assuming that the controller and the semiconductor memory device are provided on separate chips and the chips are separately mounted on a printed circuit hoard, if the bus width of the NAND bus NB is increased, additional pins for each chip and additional wires on the printed circuit board that correspond to the increased number of signal lines are required.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, the NAND bus NB is provided in the CMOS chip CC. Therefore, if the bus width of the NAND bus NB is increased as in the case of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the design change in accordance with the increase of the bus width is completed in the CMOS chip CC. Thus, the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment can increase the bus width of the NAND bus NB without increasing the pins on the chips and the wires on the printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the bus width of the first internal bus IB<b>1</b> is increased to 32 bits in accordance with the increase of the bus width of the NAND bus NB to 32 bits. Furthermore, the bus widths of the second internal bus IB<b>2</b> and the third internal bus IB<b>3</b> are increased to 64 bits. Since the first internal bus IB<b>1</b> and the second internal bus IB<b>2</b>, not only the NAND bus NB, are provided in the CMOS chip CC, the bus widths can be increased without increasing the pins on the chips and the wires on the printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The third internal bus IB<b>3</b> is provided across the CMOS chip CC and the memory chip MC, and includes the electrical coupling by the bonding pads BP. Therefore, when the bus width of the third internal bus IB<b>3</b> is increased, the signal lines included in the third internal bus IB<b>3</b> may increase and the number of bonding pads BP may also increase. However, in the bonded structure, since the bonding pads BP are collectively coupled in one step, the increase in cost can be suppressed even if the number of bonding pads BP is increased. Therefore, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the bus width of the third internal bus IB<b>3</b> can be increased, while the increase in the cost is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thus, in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the bus width of each bus can be increased and the communication band can be increased as compared to the memory system according to the first embodiment, while the increase in the cost is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, when the bus width is increased, the communication band can be increased, while, for example, the increase in the operation frequency is suppressed. In the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment, the bus width of the NAND bus NB is four times that of the NAND bus NB in the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. If the operation frequency of the NAND bus NB of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment is, for example, one third of the operation frequency of the NAND bus NB of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, the communication band of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first modification of the first embodiment can realize four thirds of the communication speed of the memory system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. Thus, by increasing the bus width, the communication band of the bus can be increased as compared to the case in which the bus width is not increased, while the operation frequency is suppressed. Furthermore, the circuit implementation can be made easier by reducing the operation frequency of the bus. As a result, the cost of development and the cost of implementation of the memory system <b>1</b> can be reduced.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Modification of First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of an arrangement of components of a memory system <b>1</b> according to the second modification of the first embodiment.
