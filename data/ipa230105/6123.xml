At this time, in addition to the thickness-shear vibration, bending vibration and contour vibration occur as secondary vibration. This secondary vibration occurs not only in the part between the excitation electrodes but in the entire crystal piece and tends to be combined with the thickness-shear vibration, which is the primary vibration. When the thickness-shear vibration and the secondary vibration are combined, the state of vibration changes, and there is a possibility of deterioration in electrical characteristics, such as an increase in the equivalent series resistance value of the crystal element.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A crystal element according to the present disclosure has a recess and/or protrusion at a holding-part side surface of a holding part and thereby reduces deterioration in electrical characteristics caused by the secondary vibration.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, with reference to the attached drawings, configurations for implementing the present disclosure (which are hereinafter denoted as &#x201c;embodiments&#x201d;) will be described.

The manufacturing method in the first embodiment includes the following first to third steps.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first step: A crystal wafer <b>20</b> that has two wafer main surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> parallel to the XZ&#x2032; plane and having a relationship of front and back is prepared, and masks <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> of a corrosion-resistant film are formed on the two wafer main surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second step: The crystal wafer <b>20</b> with the masks <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> formed thereon is immersed in etchant <b>33</b> to form a crystal piece <b>21</b> including the vibration part <b>11</b>, the holding part <b>13</b>, and the recess and/or protrusion (the recess <b>18</b>) in the crystal wafer <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The third step: The masks <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are removed from the crystal wafer <b>20</b> with the crystal piece <b>21</b> formed therein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the first step, the masks <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are formed such that the mask <b>32</b> which protects the portion that serves as the holding-part main surface <b>132</b> on the positive side of the Y&#x2032;-axis is shifted in the positive direction of the Z&#x2032;-axis relative to the mask <b>31</b> which protects the portion that serves as the holding-part main surface <b>131</b> on the negative side of the Y&#x2032;-axis.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the manufacturing method in the first embodiment, it is possible to form the recess <b>18</b> easily in the wet etching to form the crystal piece <b>21</b> by shifting one mask <b>32</b> of the masks, which protect the holding part <b>13</b>, in the Z&#x2032;-axis direction relative to the other mask <b>31</b>. Thus, not only is it possible to manufacture the crystal element <b>10</b> that provides the operation and effects described later, but it is also possible to form the recess <b>18</b> at the same time that the crystal piece <b>21</b> is formed. Thus, since a dedicated step is not necessary to form the recess <b>18</b>, the manufacturing step can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the case where the thickness t of the crystal wafer <b>20</b> in the Y&#x2032;-axis direction is 30 &#x3bc;m or more and 50 &#x3bc;m or less, the mask <b>31</b> and mask <b>32</b> may be formed in the first step such that the mask <b>32</b> which protects the portion that serves as the holding-part main surface <b>132</b> on the positive side of the Y&#x2032;-axis is shifted in the positive direction of the Z&#x2032;-axis by 10 &#x3bc;m or more and 20 &#x3bc;m or less relative to the mask <b>31</b> which protects the portion that serves as the holding-part main surface <b>131</b> on the negative side of the Y&#x2032;-axis.

The excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>, the mounting electrodes <b>151</b> and <b>152</b>, and the wiring electrodes <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> are metal patterns composed of the same material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The crystal piece <b>21</b> is an AT cut crystal plate. Specifically, defining the Cartesian coordinate system XY&#x2032;Z&#x2032; in crystal by rotating the Cartesian coordinate system XYZ including the X-axis (the electrical axis), the Y-axis (the mechanical axis), and the Z-axis (the optical axis), around the X-axis by 30&#xb0; or more and 50&#xb0; or less (for example, 35&#xb0; <b>15</b>&#x2032;), a wafer cut out parallel to the XZ&#x2032; plane is used as a raw material of the crystal piece <b>21</b>. The longitudinal direction of the crystal piece <b>21</b> is parallel to the X-axis, the lateral direction to the Z&#x2032;-axis, and the thickness direction to the Y&#x2032;-axis.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Below is an example of the dimensions of the crystal piece <b>21</b> and the like.

The holding part <b>13</b> has a thickness (in the Y&#x2032;-axis direction) of 30 to 50 &#x3bc;m, the vibration part <b>11</b> has a thickness (in the Y&#x2032;-axis direction) of approximately 6.8 &#x3bc;m, and the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> have diameters of 250 to 400 &#x3bc;m.

In other words, the thickness of the inclined part <b>12</b> decreases as the distance from the holding part <b>13</b> increases. Thus, the stress transmitted from the holding part to the vibration part <b>11</b> is absorbed or dispersed by the inclined part <b>12</b> (a gentle step). In addition, the secondary vibration generated at the vibration part <b>11</b> is gradually attenuated as it approaches the holding part <b>13</b>, and the influence of the secondary vibration on the vibration part <b>11</b> reflected by the holding part <b>13</b> reduces. Thus, the inclined part <b>12</b> plays, among other roles, a role of reducing the equivalent series resistance value.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The through hole <b>17</b> passes through between the mounting electrodes <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> and the vibration part <b>11</b> in the thickness direction.

In addition, the through hole <b>17</b> plays a role of confining the vibration energy of the vibration part <b>11</b>. Thus, the through hole <b>17</b> plays, among other roles, a role of reducing the equivalent series resistance value. In addition, because the through hole <b>17</b> is formed in the inclined part <b>12</b>, these effects are enhanced by being combined with the effects of the inclined part <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The pair of excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are approximately circular in plan view and respectively provided approximately at the centers of the vibration-part main surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> of the vibration part <b>11</b>.

Although the mounting electrodes <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> are both located on the holding-part main surface <b>132</b>, a configuration in which at least one of them is located on the holding-part main surface <b>131</b> is possible.

The primary layer plays mainly a role of providing a force for adhering to the crystal piece <b>21</b>. The conductor layer plays mainly a role of providing electrical conduction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Hereinafter, formation of a metal film is called film formation. Examples of manufacturing steps of metal patterns include a method including forming photoresist patterns after film formation on a crystal piece, and performing etching on the resultant; a method including forming photoresist patterns on a crystal piece, and performing film formation and a lift-off process on the resultant; and a method including covering a crystal piece with metal masks, and performing film formation on the resultant.

Next, masks having patterns of the outer shape of the crystal piece <b>21</b> (including the through hole <b>17</b>) and the vibration part <b>11</b> (only for one side) are laid on the photoresists, and parts of the corrosion-resistant films are exposed by exposure and development. Then, wet etching is performed on the corrosion-resistant films in this state. Next, by using the remaining corrosion-resistant films as masks, wet etching is performed on the crystal wafer to form the outer shape of the crystal piece <b>21</b> and the vibration part <b>11</b>. The outer shape of the crystal piece <b>21</b> is formed by double-sided etching, and the vibration part <b>11</b> is formed by single-sided etching.

Note that because the vibration-part main surface <b>112</b> is not covered with a mask, the recess <b>18</b> is not formed at the vibration part <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Next, the remaining corrosion-resistant films are removed from the crystal wafer, and metal films serving as the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> and others are provided on the entire surfaces of the crystal wafer. Next, photoresist masks having patterns of the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> and others are formed on the metal films, and unnecessary metal films are removed by etching to form the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> and others. Next, by removing unnecessary photoresists, a plurality of crystal elements <b>10</b> are formed in the crystal wafer. Lastly, the individual crystal elements <b>10</b> are separated from this crystal wafer to obtain discrete crystal elements <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The crystal element <b>10</b> operates as follows. An alternating voltage is applied to the crystal piece <b>21</b> via the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. Then, thickness-shear vibration occurs in the crystal piece <b>21</b> such that the vibration-part main surfaces <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are displaced from each other, and this generates a specified oscillation frequency. In this way, the crystal element <b>10</b> operates to output a signal of a constant oscillation frequency by utilizing the piezoelectric effect and inverse piezoelectric effect of the crystal piece <b>21</b>. In this operation, the thinner the crystal piece <b>21</b> between the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>(specifically, the vibration part <b>11</b>), the higher the generated oscillation frequency.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the operation and effects of the crystal element <b>10</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">(1) Since the crystal element <b>10</b> includes a recess and/or protrusion (the recess <b>18</b>) located at the holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>135</b> but not at the vibration-part side surfaces <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>115</b>, it is possible to reduce deterioration in electrical characteristics (such as an increase in the equivalent series resistance value) caused by the secondary vibration. The reason for this is as follows.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The vibration of the crystal element <b>10</b> includes thickness-shear vibration, which is the primary vibration, and contour vibration and bending vibration, which are secondary vibration. For the thickness-shear vibration, the portion between the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> is vibrating the most, but the vibration is propagated also in the portion not between the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> in the directions from the outer edges of the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> to the outer edges of the vibration part <b>11</b>. For the contour vibration, which is one mode of the secondary vibration, the shape of the crystal piece <b>21</b>, for example, the contour of the vibration part <b>11</b> in the vibration part <b>11</b> is deforming and vibrating. For the bending vibration, which is one mode of the secondary vibration, the shape of the crystal piece <b>21</b> is bending and vibrating, for example, in a direction parallel to the X-axis or in a direction parallel to the Z&#x2032;-axis in the vibration part <b>11</b>. This secondary vibration occurs not only in the portion between the excitation electrodes <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> but in the entire crystal piece <b>21</b> and tends to be combined with the thickness-shear vibration, which is the primary vibration. When the thickness-shear vibration and the secondary vibration are combined, the state of vibration changes, and this can cause deterioration in electrical characteristics, such as an increase in the equivalent series resistance value of the crystal element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the crystal elements in the related art, the side surfaces of the fixing part and the side surfaces of the vibration part have the same shape. Since secondary vibration occurs in the entire crystal piece, the secondary vibration of the fixing part and the secondary vibration of the vibration part have similar states, such that the secondary vibration falls into a kind of resonance state and is unlikely to dissipate.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In contrast, since the crystal element <b>10</b> includes a recess and/or protrusion (the recess <b>18</b>) located at the holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>135</b> but not at the vibration-part side surfaces <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>115</b>, it is possible to partially change the length of the holding part <b>13</b> parallel to the Z&#x2032;-axis. In addition, for example, by changing the depth of the recess <b>18</b> in the Z&#x2032;-axis direction, it is possible to partially change the length of the holding part <b>13</b> parallel to the X-axis, also at edge portions of the sides parallel to the X-axis. Since bending vibration and contour vibration, which are secondary vibration, are dependent on the lengths of the portions that vibrate (for example, the length parallel to the X-axis and the length parallel to the Z&#x2032;-axis), it is possible, by partially changing these lengths, to partially change the states of bending vibration and contour vibration, which are secondary vibration. Thus, the secondary vibration of the holding part <b>13</b> and the secondary vibration of the vibration part <b>11</b> are in different states, and the secondary vibration tends to attenuate. This in turn makes it possible to reduce deterioration in electrical characteristics caused by the secondary vibration.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">(2) The &#x201c;recess and/or protrusion&#x201d; may be a recess <b>18</b> recessed in the holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>135</b>. In this case, when the crystal element <b>10</b> is mounted in a package with conductive adhesive as described later, the conductive adhesive enters the recess <b>18</b>, increasing the area of adhesion of the conductive adhesive, and this improves the bonding strength of the crystal element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">(3) The vibration-part main surface <b>111</b> and the holding-part main surface <b>131</b> may be on the same plane, and the holding part <b>13</b> may be thicker than the vibration part <b>11</b>. In this case, since the structure is one in which the thick holding part <b>13</b> supports the thin vibration part <b>11</b>, even in the case where the vibration part <b>11</b> is thinner to achieve a higher oscillation frequency, it is possible to keep the mechanical strength of the crystal element <b>10</b>. In addition, since the holding part <b>13</b> is sufficiently thick, it is easy to form the recess <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">(4) The holding part <b>13</b> may have the two holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> extending along the XY&#x2032; plane and the one holding-part side surface <b>135</b> extending along the Y&#x2032;Z&#x2032; plane, and the recess <b>18</b> may be located in a portion from the holding-part side surface <b>133</b> (or the holding-part side surface <b>134</b>) to the holding-part side surface <b>135</b>. In this case, it is possible to form the recess <b>18</b> easily by shifting one of the masks that protect the holding part <b>13</b> in the Z&#x2032;-axis direction relative to the other mask in the wet etching to form the crystal piece <b>21</b>. Since the recess <b>18</b> can be formed at the same time as forming the crystal piece <b>21</b>, and since a dedicated step is not necessary to form the recess <b>18</b>, the manufacturing step can be simplified.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Other Examples</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of another example of a crystal element according to the first embodiment. Hereinafter, a description will be given based on this drawing.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The &#x201c;recesses and/or protrusion&#x201d; in a crystal element <b>10</b><i>a </i>of this example includes a first recess <b>18</b> located in a portion from the holding-part side surface <b>133</b> to the holding-part side surface <b>135</b> and a second recess <b>19</b> located in a portion from the holding-part side surface <b>134</b> to the holding-part side surface <b>135</b>. The recess <b>19</b>, as with the recess <b>18</b>, has a groove shape recessed in the holding-part side surfaces <b>134</b> and <b>135</b> of the holding part <b>13</b> and extends in the longitudinal direction of the crystal element <b>10</b> in the holding-part side surface <b>134</b>. The dimension of the recess <b>19</b> in the Z&#x2032;-axis direction (the depth of the groove) does not have to be constant. For example, the depth may increase as the position approaches the holding-part side surface <b>135</b>. Note that the inclined-part side surfaces <b>123</b> and <b>124</b> may also include the recess and/or protrusion (the recesses <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the crystal element <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the recesses <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> at both of the holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>134</b> further increase the difference between the secondary vibration of the holding part <b>13</b> and the secondary vibration of the vibration part <b>11</b>. This makes it possible to further reduce deterioration in electrical characteristics caused by the secondary vibration. In addition, since the crystal element <b>10</b><i>a </i>has the recesses <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> at both of the holding-part side surfaces <b>133</b> and <b>134</b>, it is possible to further improve the bonding strength to mount the crystal element <b>10</b><i>a </i>in a package with conductive adhesive.
