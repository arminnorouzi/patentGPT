Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electric vehicles are becoming more ubiquitous on the roads. These vehicles may provide significant advantages over conventional gas engine vehicles such as reduced emissions, increased acceleration, and the like. Some electric vehicles include an additional source of electricity such as a gas engine and a generator to convert power from the gas engine into electricity, or a fuel cell stack that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity. Vehicles without this additional energy source have a disadvantage in that their range is limited by the capacity of the on-board battery.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Advances are being made in charging technology to increase charging rate. Likewise, more electric charging stations are being installed daily. However, the amount of time for a typical recharge may be relatively great, and there still exists a relatively large swath of land that is without electric charging stations. In that regard, it is desirable to determine ways to enlarge a driving range.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the art for enlarging a driving range that is reachable by various vehicle users.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Described herein is a system for managing sharing of electric vehicles.

The systems provide various benefits and advantages such as providing users the opportunity to swap a current vehicle for a new vehicle that may have a greater state of charge (SOC). This advantageously significantly increases a range in which electric vehicle users can travel because each vehicle in the network may be drivable by the vehicle users. The systems further provide the advantage of allowing drivers to provide their vehicle preferences so that any borrowed vehicle matches their preferences. The systems advantageously allow for autonomous travel of vehicles such that a vehicle to be borrowed may autonomously drive to a location of a vehicle user, thus saving the user time and energy. The systems further provide the advantage of allowing a driver's information to be transferred automatically from their previous vehicle to their next vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An exemplary system includes a server having a processor and a memory. The memory may store vehicle information from multiple vehicles including a state of charge (SOC) of the vehicles, locations of the vehicles, or the like. The memory may also store preference data corresponding to preferences of users (such as vehicle type, desirable accessories, or the like). The processor may receive a vehicle swap request from a user corresponding to a request to swap a current vehicle for a new vehicle. The processor may then determine which vehicles are available for the user to drive. The processor may select and transmit information corresponding to one of the available vehicles as a selected available vehicle, such that the user may then borrow the selected available vehicle to increase a driving range.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>1</b> for managing sharing of vehicle (e.g., swapping of a first, or requesting, vehicle with a second, or available, vehicle) is shown. The system <b>1</b> includes a server <b>2</b>, a plurality of vehicles <b>9</b>, and one or more mobile device <b>22</b>. The server <b>2</b> includes a processor <b>4</b>, a memory <b>6</b>, and a network access device <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The server <b>2</b> may be a cloud server or a dedicated server, and may be hosted in a single location or may be distributed across multiple locations. The server <b>2</b> may include redundant capabilities to ensure continuous operation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The processor <b>4</b> may include one or more logic devices such as one or more of a central processing unit (CPU), an accelerated processing unit (APU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or the like. The memory <b>6</b> may include any non-transitory memory <b>6</b> known in the art. The memory <b>6</b> may store instructions usable by the processor <b>4</b> to perform operations (i.e., may store specific program instructions for the processor <b>4</b> to perform the various actions described herein). The memory <b>6</b> may also or instead store other data as instructed by the processor <b>4</b> such as storing received vehicle data or vehicle locations received from the plurality of vehicles <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The network access device <b>8</b> may include any network access device capable of communicating via a wireless protocol. For example, the network access device <b>8</b> may communicate via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, a cellular protocol, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications, Zigbee, or any other wireless protocol. The network access device <b>8</b> may communicate (i.e., transmit and/or receive data) with respective network access devices of the plurality of vehicles <b>9</b> and the mobile devices <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The vehicles <b>9</b> may include any vehicles which utilize electrical energy to generate propulsion. For example and as described in further detail below, the vehicles <b>9</b> may include a battery that stores electrical energy and a motor-generator that converts stored electrical energy into rotational power (i.e., torque).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vehicles <b>9</b> may include, for example, a first vehicle <b>10</b>, a second vehicle <b>12</b>, and a third vehicle <b>100</b>. Some or all of the vehicles <b>9</b> may transmit vehicle data to the server <b>2</b> via the network access device <b>8</b>. For example, the first vehicle <b>10</b> may transmit first vehicle data <b>14</b> to the server <b>2</b> and the second vehicle may transmit second vehicle data <b>16</b> to the server <b>2</b>. The first vehicle data <b>14</b> and the second vehicle data <b>16</b> may include, for example, a current location of the respective vehicle <b>9</b>, a current state of charge (SOC) of a battery of the respective vehicle <b>9</b>, whether the vehicle <b>9</b> is available to be driven, whether the respective vehicle <b>9</b> is a self-charging vehicle (e.g., whether it includes fuel cells or gas and a generator to generate electricity, or whether it is a pure electric vehicle), a model of the respective vehicle <b>9</b>, available features within the respective vehicle <b>9</b>, or the like. The vehicle data <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may further include account information associated with the respective vehicle such as corresponding to a charge account (which may include credit card or bank account information) or a loyalty account (which may include a quantity of loyalty points associated with the account). The vehicle data <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may also include preference data including a minimum SOC to which the owner of the respective vehicle <b>9</b> is willing for the respective vehicle <b>9</b> to be depleted. The preference data may also include a cost to use the respective vehicle <b>9</b> or a range of dates or times during which the respective vehicle <b>9</b> is available to be used. The preference data may also include a geographical area in which the respective vehicle <b>9</b> is willing to be driven in.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">From time to time, a user of one of the vehicles <b>9</b> may realize its SOC is less than a desired amount such that the vehicle is incapable of reaching a destination without being charged. In that regard, the user may request use of any other vehicles <b>9</b> associated with the system <b>1</b> (or even vehicles unassociated with the system <b>1</b>) while the user's vehicle is being charged. For example, the vehicle <b>100</b> may transmit a swap request <b>18</b> to the server <b>2</b>. The swap request <b>18</b> may include various information such as a current SOC of the vehicle <b>100</b>, a destination of the vehicle user, a current location of the vehicle <b>100</b>, a price that an owner of the vehicle <b>100</b> is willing to pay for use of another vehicle, a current range of the vehicle <b>100</b>, a geographical area in which the vehicle <b>100</b> is willing to remain, a direction of travel of the vehicle <b>100</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The server <b>2</b> may receive the swap request <b>18</b> and may select one or more of the remaining vehicles <b>9</b> as available vehicles that meet the criteria of the swap request <b>18</b>. For example, if the swap request <b>18</b> requests 3 hours of use then the server <b>2</b> may select any of the vehicles <b>9</b> that are available during that time period and have at least enough energy to remain driving for the three hours as available vehicles. In some embodiments, the server <b>2</b> may select an optimal available vehicle and may transmit available vehicle data corresponding to the optimal available vehicle to the vehicle <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the server <b>2</b> may select multiple available vehicles and may transmit available vehicle data <b>20</b> corresponding to each of the multiple available vehicles to the vehicle <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> (or a user of the vehicle <b>100</b>) may select a selected available vehicle based on the available vehicle data <b>20</b> and may transmit the selected available vehicle to the server <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The server <b>2</b> may then transmit additional available vehicle data <b>20</b> to the vehicle <b>100</b> (or a mobile device <b>22</b> associated with a user of the vehicle <b>100</b>) which may include a current location of the selected vehicle, digital key information corresponding to the selected vehicle, navigation instructions to the selected vehicle, or the like. In some embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> may be autonomous and therefore capable of autonomously traveling to the location of the selected vehicle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, additional details of the vehicle <b>100</b> are shown. The vehicle <b>100</b> may include a system <b>101</b> for facilitating sharing of vehicles by users. The vehicle <b>100</b> (or system <b>101</b>) may include an ECU <b>102</b>, a memory <b>104</b>, a power source <b>106</b>, and a main body <b>109</b>. The vehicle <b>100</b> (or system <b>101</b>) may further include a network access device <b>110</b>, an image sensor <b>122</b>, a location sensor <b>124</b>, and a sensor <b>132</b>. The vehicle <b>100</b> may also include an input device <b>138</b> and an output device <b>140</b>, which together may be referred to as the IVI interface <b>139</b>. The vehicle <b>100</b> may further include a charge port <b>152</b> and a port <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The main body <b>109</b> may be propelled along a roadway, may be suspended in or on water, or may fly through air. The main body <b>109</b> may resemble a vehicle such as a car, a bus, a motorcycle, a boat, an aircraft, or the like. The main body <b>109</b> may further support one or more individual such as a driver, a passenger, or the like. The main body <b>109</b> may define or include a vehicle cabin <b>111</b> in which a driver, passengers, or the like may be located.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ECU <b>102</b> may be coupled to each of the components of the vehicle <b>100</b> and may include one or more processors or controllers which may be specifically designed for automotive systems. The functions of the ECU <b>102</b> may be implemented in a single ECU or in multiple ECUs. For example, the ECU <b>102</b> may include a power source ECU that controls the power source <b>106</b>, an IVI ECU that controls the IVI interface <b>139</b>, or the like. The ECU <b>102</b> may receive data from components of the vehicle <b>100</b>, may make determinations based on the received data, and may control the operations of the components based on the determinations.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The vehicle <b>100</b> may be non-autonomous, fully autonomous, or semi-autonomous. In that regard, the ECU <b>102</b> may control various aspects of the vehicle <b>100</b> (such as steering, braking, accelerating, or the like) to maneuver the vehicle <b>100</b> from a starting location to a destination location. In some embodiments, the vehicle <b>100</b> may be operated in an autonomous, semi-autonomous, or fully driver-operated state. In that regard, the vehicle <b>100</b> may be operated independently of driver control and, from time to time, without a person inside of the vehicle <b>100</b>. The ECU <b>102</b> may facilitate such autonomous functionality. The ECU <b>102</b> may also, for example, control charging of the vehicle <b>100</b> via the charge port <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The memory <b>104</b> may include any non-transitory memory and may store data usable by the ECU <b>102</b>. The memory <b>104</b> may be located in or on the main body <b>109</b> and may thus be referred to as a local memory. In some embodiments, the memory <b>104</b> may be located remote from the main body <b>109</b> and may thus be a remote memory (i.e., memory that is accessed from the cloud via the network access device <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The power source <b>106</b> may include any one or more of an engine <b>114</b>, a motor-generator <b>116</b>, a battery <b>118</b>, and a fuel cell circuit <b>120</b>.

The method <b>300</b> may be used by a server to manage a fleet (e.g., a rental fleet, a fleet owned by a dealership, a fleet managed by a government or private entity, a fleet available for members, or the like). Multiple users may be members of an organization that is associated with the fleet, and the method <b>300</b> may facilitate sharing of the vehicles of the fleet. For example, users or members of the organization may realize that a current vehicle lacks sufficient charge to reach a destination, and may request a vehicle swap using a mobile device or via an input device of the current vehicle. The method <b>300</b> may be used to file an available vehicle which the user may drive that will allow him to reach the destination without having to recharge.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The method <b>300</b> may begin in block <b>302</b> in which a server may receive available vehicle information from a plurality of vehicles. The available vehicle information may include any of multiple types of information such as a current SOC of each respective vehicle, a current range of each vehicle, a model or vehicle type of each vehicle, a current location of each vehicle, features of the vehicle, time periods in which the vehicle is available for use, a cost per unit of time to use the vehicle (e.g., if the owner of the vehicle is to be paid for its use), or the like.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In block <b>304</b>, the server may store, in a memory, preferences for each of multiple users. The preferences may be received from the users (e.g., via input provided by a mobile device or by an input device of a vehicle) or may be learned (e.g., the server may learn preferences of each user as they interact with the system; for example, if the user always requests an SUV from the available vehicles then the server may learn that a preference is to drive SUVs). The preferences may include, for example, vehicle types or models, an amount of time that the driver prefers to drive without stopping to recharge the vehicle, whether the user prefers to pay more money to use higher end vehicles, features that the driver prefers (e.g., touchscreen navigation or Bluetooth-compatible entertainment systems), or the like.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In block <b>306</b>, the server may store account information associated with multiple vehicles. For example, the account information may include bank account and routing numbers, credit card numbers, usernames, or the like for drivers or owners of the vehicles in the fleet. This account information may be used as credit information (e.g., to pay for use of another vehicle) or debit information (e.g., to compensate owners of the vehicles for use of their vehicles).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In block <b>308</b>, the server may receive or determine a vehicle swap event. For example, a user of a vehicle in the fleet may transmit a vehicle swap request via an input device of a current vehicle or via a mobile device associated with the user. In some embodiments, the server may determine the vehicle swap event. For example, the server may learn that a current vehicle of a user has insufficient charge to reach a destination, and the server may determine a vehicle swap event in response to making this determination. The vehicle swap event may correspond to a request or instruction for a user of the system to borrow or otherwise use another vehicle in the fleet.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The vehicle swap event may include, for example, a current location of a current vehicle (or of the user), a destination of the user, a current SOC of the current vehicle, a schedule of the user, user preferences, or the like.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In block <b>310</b>, the server may identify available vehicles as vehicles that are available for use by the user and are within a current range of the current vehicle. In some embodiments, the server may only select available vehicles as vehicles that are on a current route of the current vehicle, that meet predetermined body type preferences, or that are available for an entire duration of a trip of the user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In block <b>312</b>, the server may select one or more available vehicles from the plurality of available vehicles based on the vehicle data received or stored in block <b>302</b>, based on the preferences of the requesting user in block <b>304</b>, and based on the vehicle swap event in block <b>308</b>. In some embodiments, the server may identify only one optimal available vehicle that best meets the preferences of the requesting user and meets the vehicle swap event (e.g., that is within a current range of the current vehicle and preferably is on a route from a current location of the current vehicle to a destination). In some embodiments, the server may identify multiple available vehicles that meet at least some preferences of the requesting user and the swap event. In some embodiments, the server may be programmed to store, or to learn, an importance of each user preference (e.g., the server may learn that reducing trip time is the most important factor for a user, or that inclusion of a high-quality sound system is the most important factor). The server may or may not rank the available vehicles based on how well each meets the preferences and the swap event.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In block <b>314</b>, the server may transmit available vehicle data corresponding to the one or more available vehicle to the current vehicle or device. The available vehicle data may include relatively little information or may include a significantly larger quantity of information. For example, the available vehicle data may include any of the vehicle data from block <b>302</b> such as current location of the available vehicle(s), an SOC of the available vehicle(s), a date and/or time that the available vehicle is available for use, or the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As server above, the processor may transmit available vehicle data corresponding to multiple available vehicles to the current vehicle (or other device associated with the current vehicle). In that regard, an output device of the current vehicle (or a mobile device associated with the current vehicle) may output the available vehicle information such that a user of the current vehicle may review the available vehicle information. In block <b>316</b> and after reviewing the available vehicle information, an input device of the current vehicle (or mobile device) may receive a selection of one of the available vehicles, and this selection may be provided to the server. This selected vehicle may be referred to as the selected available vehicle. In some embodiments, the server may select a single selected available vehicle such that block <b>316</b> is unnecessary. The single, resulting available vehicle that is driven by the user may be referred to as a new driving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In block <b>318</b>, the server may determine digital key information corresponding to the new driving vehicle. The digital key information may be stored in the memory of the new driving vehicle (i.e., as part of the vehicle data) or may be generated for a single use. For example, once an available vehicle is selected as the new driving vehicle, the server may generate a single-use digital key that the user may use to drive the new driving vehicle. In some embodiments, the new driving vehicle may travel to a location of the current vehicle or the user (i.e., the new driving vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle and may receive a destination address or navigation instructions from the server).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In block <b>320</b>, the server may transmit the determined digital key information to the current vehicle or to a mobile device associated with a user of the current vehicle. As referenced above, the digital key information may include a digital key that allows access to the charging vehicle (or to a portion of the charging vehicle).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In block <b>322</b>, the server may transmit at least one of navigation instructions or an address of the selected available (i.e., the new driving) vehicle to the current vehicle or to the mobile device of the user. In some embodiments, the current vehicle may be an autonomous vehicle and may use the navigation instructions or address to autonomously drive the user to the location of the new driving vehicle. In some embodiments, the new driving vehicle and the current vehicle may both be autonomous, and may each drive to the location of the other (i.e., the new driving vehicle may travel to the current location of the current vehicle and vice versa) such that the user need not travel to the current location of the new driving vehicle. In some embodiments, the user may drive the current vehicle to the location of the new driving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In block <b>324</b>, the server may transmit a reminder to charge the current vehicle at the location of the selected available vehicle. This reminder may be transmitted to the current vehicle or to the mobile device of the user. In this way, the current vehicle may be at least partially recharged when the user retrieves it (if it belongs to the user) or at least partially recharged such that another user of the fleet may drive it.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In block <b>326</b>, the server may receive confirmation of the vehicle swap. For example, at least one of the current vehicle or the new driving vehicle may transmit a notification to the server that the swap has been completed. As another example, the user may provide input via one of the vehicles or via a mobile device indicating that he has taken control of the new driving vehicle. As yet another example, the new driving vehicle may transmit a notification to the server in response to the digital key being used at the new driving vehicle, thus indicating that the swap is complete.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, information related to the driver may be automatically transferred from the current vehicle to the new driving vehicle. The transfer may be directly between the current vehicle and the new driving vehicle via known wireless communication protocols in the art or via the server. By example and not limitation, the information may include destinations, routes, points of interests, personal settings (e.g., seat adjustment, climate settings, mobile phone settings, etc.), music data, access keys (e.g., garage door, gate, etc.), and a toll collection identifier.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, a method <b>400</b> for managing sharing of electrical vehicles is shown.

The ECU may determine the vehicle swap event based on any of a number of criteria. For example, the ECU may determine a vehicle swap event in response to a current range of the current vehicle being less than a total distance from a current location to a destination. The ECU may also predict a current or future destination and determine a vehicle swap event if the vehicle includes insufficient SOC to reach the predicted destination. In some embodiments, the ECU may likewise predict an amount of time spent at each stop and predict or determine whether a vehicle charger is available at each destination. The ECU may take the potential charging opportunities into consideration when determining the vehicle swap event.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the server may determine the vehicle swap event for the vehicle. The server may determine the vehicle swap event based on the same or similar considerations as the ECU uses in its prediction. In that regard, the vehicle may transmit information to the server such as a destination (or the server may predict the destination) and a current SOC, and the server may determine the vehicle swap event based on an analysis of this information.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In block <b>406</b>, the ECU of the vehicle may learn preferences of a vehicle user. For example, the preferences may be similar to the preferences of block <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the ECU may transmit the learned preferences to the server and, in some embodiments, the ECU may store the learned preferences in a local memory on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In block <b>408</b>, the ECU may receive available vehicle data for a plurality of available vehicles. The server may transmit the available vehicle data to the vehicle in response to receiving the vehicle swap event. That is, the ECU may transmit the vehicle swap event to the server (or the server may determine the vehicle swap event), the server may then determine available vehicles that meet the swap event and the driver preferences, and the server may transmit the available vehicle data to the current vehicle. In some embodiments, the server may only select a single available vehicle that best matches the preferences and vehicle swap event and, in some embodiments, the server may select multiple available vehicles.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In block <b>410</b>, the ECU may select a selected available vehicle based on the received available vehicle data. For example, the server may transmit all available vehicles to the ECU that match the swap request (e.g., it may transmit information corresponding to each available vehicle within a current range of the current vehicle). The ECU may then analyze the available vehicle data and the learned user preferences and may select an available vehicle that best matches the user preferences. In some embodiments, the ECU may control an output device to output the available vehicle data such that the vehicle user may select a preferred available vehicle.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In block <b>412</b>, the ECU may receive location information corresponding to the location of the selected available vehicle and, in some embodiments, the ECU may receive navigation instructions from its current location to the location of the selected available vehicle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In block <b>414</b>, the ECU may control the current vehicle to autonomously travel to the location of the selected available vehicle. For example, the ECU may determine a route from a current location to the location of the selected available vehicle and may autonomously control various aspects of the vehicle to travel to the location of the selected available vehicle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In block <b>416</b>, the ECU or a mobile device associated with a user of the current vehicle may receive digital key information. The digital key information may be usable to access and operate the selected available vehicle. In some embodiments, the server may generate a temporary digital key that is transmitted to the vehicle or mobile device that is operable for a period of time. In some embodiments, the server may transmit a digital key that is always usable to operate the selected available vehicle. In embodiments in which the vehicle receives the digital key information, the ECU may transmit the digital key information to a mobile device associated with the vehicle user such that the vehicle user may operate the selected available vehicle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In block <b>418</b>, the current vehicle may output a reminder for the user to plug in the current vehicle at the location of the selected available vehicle. This reminder may be output via an output device of the current vehicle, or may be transmitted to the mobile device associated with the user. Because the current vehicle may have a relatively low SOC, it may be desirable for the current vehicle to be recharged such that it is available for the user (or for another user) to use. The reminder may be transmitted or output prior to, or in response to, the current vehicle reaching the location of the selected available vehicle. In some embodiments, the reminder may include instructions for charging the current vehicle.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In block <b>420</b>, the vehicle may transmit updated available vehicle data to the server.
