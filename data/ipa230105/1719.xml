Further, bubbles may be generated in the liquid in the tank <b>411</b> and the liquid may become a state not suitable for printing.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Therefore, when such situation is detected by the sensor <b>6</b>, the controller <b>71</b> immediately instructs to stop the agitating operation.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In contrast, from the detection result of the sensor <b>6</b>, when it is determined that the &#x201c;agitating status&#x201d; is suitable (that is, the agitating operation suitable according to the &#x201c;agitating information&#x201d; is performed) (step S<b>7</b>; YES), the controller <b>71</b> notifies to the user that the agitating is complete by blinking of the lamp <b>16</b> or the display on the display <b>85</b> (step S<b>9</b>).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">When the agitating ends, the user suitably places the printing apparatus <b>1</b> (apparatus main body <b>100</b>) against the skin surface (printing target) of the face and the process progresses to the printing operation. When the process progresses to the printing operation without suitably performing the agitating, a warning may be notified by the lamp <b>16</b> or the display <b>85</b>, and the printing apparatus <b>1</b> may be controlled so that the process cannot progress to the printing operation.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">With this, the printing can be performed in a state in which the liquid <b>3</b> is evenly mixed in the tank <b>411</b>, and printing can be performed with a beautiful finish on the printing target such as the skin surface without causing failure in discharge or failure in printing such as uneven coloring.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">When there are a plurality of printing target positions on the skin surface, etc. (that is, locations that the user desires to cover by printing such as blemishes), when the printing operation of one location is finished, it is assumed that the user returns the apparatus main body <b>100</b> to the stand <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment. Therefore, the process is repeated from step S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> again each time the printing operation ends in one location. In this case, it is assumed that the &#x201c;static condition time&#x201d; becomes very short. When the &#x201c;static condition time&#x201d; determined in step S<b>5</b> is a short amount of time that the separation and sediment of the liquid <b>3</b> hardly occurs (that is, 1 hour or less, such as about 20 to 30 minutes), the controller <b>71</b> notifies to the user &#x201c;no agitating operation&#x201d; as the &#x201c;agitating information&#x201d;, and it is possible to instruct to progress to the printing operation immediately.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">When the printing operation is performed, the apparatus is moved slightly up and down or the apparatus is slightly tilted when the printing apparatus <b>1</b> (apparatus main body <b>100</b>) is placed against the skin surface. With this, some vibration (movement) is applied to the tank <b>411</b>. When the separation and the sedimentation of the liquid <b>3</b> is very slight, the liquid in the tank <b>411</b> is agitated with such small amount of vibration and the liquid <b>3</b> becomes a state suitable for printing.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The embodiment is not limited to performing the printing one location at a time. For example, the entire printing target (for example, skin surface of face) may be sequentially imaged by the imager <b>5</b>, and once the printing starts, the deviation of the color may be detected in the printing target location from the imaged image, and the printing of the printing target location may be performed successively.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">In this case, when there are a plurality of printing target locations in the printing target (for example, skin surface of the face), the apparatus main body <b>100</b> is placed on the stand <b>200</b> after the printing of all printing target locations is finished.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">As described above, the printing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes the carriage <b>42</b> as the holder that holds the tank <b>411</b> that stores the liquid <b>3</b>, the sensor <b>6</b> that detects the state of the motion (movement, vibration) of the tank <b>411</b>, and a controller <b>71</b> that functions as the static condition time obtainer that obtains static condition time of the tank <b>411</b> based on the state of the motion (movement, vibration) detected by the sensor and the information outputter that outputs the agitating information of the liquid <b>3</b> in the tank <b>411</b> based on at least the static condition time (that is, the dispersion information showing the operation to disperse the liquid <b>3</b> in the tank <b>411</b>).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">According to the above, it is possible to obtain the &#x201c;agitating information (dispersion information)&#x201d; that shows what kind of agitating (dispersion operation) should be performed to make the liquid <b>3</b> in the storage <b>411</b> an even state from the static condition time of the tank <b>411</b> and to notify the information to the user. Therefore, even when the liquid <b>3</b> is a cosmetic ink (with a color of the skin) in which titanium dioxide is included as the solute <b>32</b>, in which the solvent <b>31</b> and the solute <b>32</b> tend to easily separate, and in which the solute <b>32</b> tends to easily settle, the liquid <b>3</b> is dispersed again so that printing can be performed after the liquid <b>3</b> is in a state suitable for printing.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">When the printing is performed in a state in which separation and sedimentation are occurring in the liquid <b>3</b>, the discharger <b>412</b> (nozzle formed in the discharger <b>412</b>) that discharges the liquid <b>3</b> may be clogged and failure in discharging may occur. Moreover, the liquid may be discharged in a state in which the mixture ratio of the solute <b>32</b> is high.
