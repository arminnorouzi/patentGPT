Generally, a fingerprint module may be arranged below a screen of the mobile terminal. During unlocking, the user may press the screen with a finger, the screen may emit light to illuminate the fingerprint of the finger. After being reflected, incident light including fingerprint information may be incident to the fingerprint module, and the incident light may illuminate an optical fingerprint chip through a lens and a light filter in sequence. The optical fingerprint chip may generate a fingerprint image, and when the fingerprint image is consistent with a fingerprint image reserved in the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal is unlocked.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">Generally, after the above incident light illuminates the optical fingerprint chip, in a case that a spatial frequency of the incident light is relatively low, the optical fingerprint chip may generate a clear fingerprint image, where the spatial frequency may represent the clarity of the image, and the higher the spatial frequency, the clearer the image. However, since reflected light passes through the screen before illuminating the optical fingerprint chip, the reflected light may be affected by the screen, causing the spatial frequency of the reflected light to be the same as the spatial frequency of the screen, and pixels of the fingerprint information to be the same as pixels of the screen. Generally, the spatial frequency of the screen is relatively high. Therefore, the spatial frequency of the reflected light illuminating the optical fingerprint chip is also relatively high. In this way, in a case that the reflected light has a relatively high spatial frequency, the pixels of the fingerprint information will be parallel to pixels of the optical fingerprint chip. As a result, the moire pattern is generated between the fingerprint module and the screen, and further the fingerprint image generated by the optical fingerprint chip includes the moire pattern. Since the fingerprint is similar to the moire pattern, the fingerprint image is not clear in a case that the fingerprint image includes the moire pattern, so as to affect the recognition accuracy of the optical fingerprint.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">Currently, in order to eliminate the moire pattern, the fingerprint module may be largely rotated relative to the screen. In this way, in a case that the pixels of the screen and the pixels of the optical fingerprint chip form a certain angle, it is hard to generate the moire pattern. However, the actual effect of this manner is not good, and the moire pattern cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, since the fingerprint module needs to be fixed on a middle frame of the mobile terminal, if the fingerprint module is rotated by a certain angle, a part of the space on the mainboard is occupied, decreasing a space utilization rate of the middle frame.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">To resolve the above technical problem, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a fingerprint module, a fingerprint recognition system, and an electronic device. The fingerprint module includes a lens, a crystal and an optical fingerprint chip, the crystal being an anisotropic medium, where the lens is located on one side of the crystal, the optical fingerprint chip is located on the other side of the crystal, and the optical fingerprint chip is fixed in a substrate of an electronic device. Incident light including fingerprint information is incident to the crystal through the lens and is incident to the optical fingerprint chip after being refracted by the crystal; and the optical fingerprint chip is used for generating a fingerprint image, and the fingerprint image is used for fingerprint recognition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">In this way, since the crystal is the anisotropic medium and the anisotropic medium has a birefringent effect, the optical fingerprint chip may generate the fingerprint image without a moire pattern based on the light refracted by the crystal, so as to eliminate the moire pattern and improve accuracy of the fingerprint recognition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">In addition, since the moire pattern may be eliminated through the birefringent effect of the crystal rather than a manner of rotating the fingerprint module relative to a screen, the space of a mainboard may be saved and a space utilization rate of a middle frame may be increased.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">The following clearly describes the technical solutions in embodiments of the present disclosure with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present disclosure. Apparently, the described embodiments are some of the embodiments rather than all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. All other embodiments derived by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present disclosure shall fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">It is to be noted that the main idea of the embodiments of the present disclosure is to replace the light filter in the current fingerprint module with the crystal, where the crystal is the anisotropic medium and has birefringent effect. Therefore, based on the birefringent effect of the crystal itself, the crystal may refract the incident light into second light and first light. On one hand, the spatial frequency of the second light and the spatial frequency of the first light may be less than the spatial frequency of the incident light. On the other hand, the distance between the second light and the first light may be a first preset distance, so as to effectively avoid generating the moire pattern in the fingerprint image.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">The technical solutions provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a fingerprint module according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the fingerprint module may include a lens, a crystal, and an optical fingerprint chip, where the crystal is an anisotropic medium.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lens is located on one side of the crystal, the optical fingerprint chip is located on the other side of the crystal, and the optical fingerprint chip may be fixed in a substrate of an electronic device, where the substrate may be understood as an integrated circuit board in the electronic device, and be configured to integrate various chips and circuits in the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">In this embodiment, incident light including fingerprint information may be incident to the crystal through the lens.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">Optionally, when a user unlocks a mobile terminal through an optical fingerprint, a finger may be used to execute a pressing operation on a screen of the mobile terminal, and the screen may generate the incident light after receiving the pressing operation. The incident light may illuminate the fingerprint of the finger, so that the incident light includes the fingerprint information of the finger. After that, the incident light including the fingerprint information may be incident to the lens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through the screen, and then be incident to the crystal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through the lens.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">It is to be noted that since the incident light passes through the screen before being incident to the lens, the spatial frequency of the incident light is equal to the spatial frequency of the screen.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, after the incident light is incident to the crystal through the lens, since the crystal is the anisotropic medium and the anisotropic medium has a birefringent effect, the optical fingerprint chip may generate the fingerprint image without a moire pattern based on the light refracted by the crystal so as to eliminate the moire pattern and improve accuracy of the fingerprint recognition.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">Optionally, based on the birefringent effect of the crystal itself, the crystal may refract the incident light into first light and second light, where the first light and the second light are propagated in different directions in the crystal and have different propagation speeds. The spatial frequency of the first light and the spatial frequency of the second light are less than the spatial frequency of the incident light, and the distance between the first light and the second light may be a first preset distance, where the first preset distance is a horizontal distance between the first light and the second light after being emergent from the crystal. The spatial frequency of the incident light may be effectively reduced in a case that the distance between the second light and the first light is the first preset distance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">After the first light and the second light are incident to the optical fingerprint chip, the optical fingerprint chip may generate a fingerprint image without the moire pattern.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">That is to say, the crystal may effectively reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light while the crystal refracts the incident light into the first light and the second light, so that the spatial frequency of the incident light may satisfy the requirement of the optical fingerprint chip on the spatial frequency of the incident light. On this basis, the moire pattern is not generated in the fingerprint image generated by the optical fingerprint chip.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">In this way, with the birefringent effect of the crystal itself, the incident light including the fingerprint information is refracted into the first light and the second light which have relatively low spatial frequencies and between which the distance is the first preset distance, and when the first light and the second light illuminate the optical fingerprint chip, the optical fingerprint chip may generate the fingerprint image without the moire pattern based on the first light and the second light, so as to eliminate the moire pattern and improve the accuracy of the fingerprint recognition.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">In addition, since the moire pattern may be eliminated through the birefringent effect of the crystal rather than a manner of rotating the fingerprint module relative to a screen, the space of a mainboard may be saved and a space utilization rate of a middle frame may be increased.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">Optionally, the spatial frequency of the incident light may be reduced by the lens in this embodiment, that is, the spatial frequency of the incident light before being incident to the lens is greater than the spatial frequency of the incident light after passing through the lens. Correspondingly, the spatial frequency of the incident light after passing through the lens is greater than the spatial frequency of the first light and the spatial frequency of the second light.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">That is to say, after the incident light including the fingerprint information is incident to the lens, the lens may reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light, and after the incident light is incident to the crystal through the lens, the crystal may reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light. Under the joint action of the lens and the crystal. the spatial frequency of the incident light may be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">Optionally, in order to understand how to effectively reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light under the joint action of the lens and the crystal more clearly, reference may be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the vertical coordinate represents the optical transfer function, and the horizontal coordinate represents the spatial frequency. When the optical transfer function is 0, it indicates that the image is completely black, and when the optical transfer function is 1, it indicates that the image is sharp and clear.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the optical transfer function of the lens is in a downward trend from low frequency to high frequency. When the spatial frequency is 100, the optical transfer function of the lens is 0, which means that after the incident light whose spatial frequency is 100 passes through the lens, the image generated is completely black. That is to say, after the incident light is incident to the lens, the lens may reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light to a value below 100.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">The optical transfer function of the crystal is also in a downward trend from low frequency to high frequency. When the spatial frequency is 80, the optical transfer function of the crystal is 0, which means that after the incident light whose spatial frequency is 80 passes through the crystal, the image generated is completely black. That is to say, after the incident light is incident to the crystal, the crystal may reduce the spatial frequency of the incident light to a value below 80.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">In conclusion, under the joint action of the lens and the crystal, when the spatial frequency of the incident light is 50, the optical transfer function is 0, which means that after the incident light whose spatial frequency is 50 passes through the lens and the crystal in sequence, the image generated is completely black. That is to say, after the incident light is incident to the lens and the crystal in sequence, the spatial frequency of the incident light may be reduced to a value below 50. In this way, after the incident light is incident to the crystal through the lens, the spatial frequency may be effectively reduced, so as to eliminate the moire pattern.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">In this embodiment, when the first preset distance between the first light and the second light is equal to (2n+1) fringe widths, the spatial frequency of the incident light may be effectively reduced, so that the optical fingerprint chip generates the fingerprint image without the moire pattern, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0. One fringe width may be understood as one line pair, and the line pair is related to the spatial frequency. Optionally, the unit of the spatial frequency is 1 p/mm, which means the number of line pairs included per millimeter. The higher the spatial frequency, the more the line pairs included per 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">Optionally, when the distance between the first light and the second light is equal to (2n+1) fringe widths, the light intensity of the first light and the second light is 0, where the light intensity represents the energy of the light passing through a unit area vertically in a unit time.
