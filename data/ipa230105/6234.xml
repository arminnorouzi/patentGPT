Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, solid oxide fuel cells (hereinafter, written as &#x201c;SOFCs&#x201d;) are known as a type of electrochemical cells that use an electrolyte material composed of a solid oxide. Oxide ion conductors, typically stabilized zirconia, are generally used widely as SOFC electrolyte materials. The oxide ion conductors exhibit a lower ion conductivity with decreasing temperature. Thus, SOFCs utilizing stabilized zirconia as an electrolyte material need to be operated at a temperature of, for example, higher than or equal to 700&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, SOFCs using a proton conductive electrolyte material may be operated at, for example, about 500&#xb0; C. to 600&#xb0; C. This is because protons are conducted with less activation energy than oxide ions, and the decrease in ion conductivity is small even at a low temperature. Thus, SOFCs using a proton conductive electrolyte material attract attention from the points of view of chemical stability of members and cost reduction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical proton conductive electrolyte materials that are known are perovskite-type composite oxides represented by the chemical formula BaCe<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b1;</sub>, BaZr<sub>1-x-y</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b1; </sub>or BaZr<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b1;</sub>. In these chemical formulas, M is a trivalent substitution element. The value of &#x3b1; indicates the amount of oxygen deficiency. The values of x and y satisfy 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;(x+y)&#x3c;1.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described in, for example, Japanese Patent No. 4583810 (Patent Literature 1) and Japanese Patent No. 3733030 (Patent Literature 2), proton conductive perovskite-type composite oxides are conventionally suggested as electrolyte materials for constituting SOFC electrolyte membranes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, similar electrode materials are used in an SOFC having a proton conductive electrolyte material and in an SOFC having an oxide ion conductive electrolyte material.

Patent Literature 1 describes that transition metals such as nickel are elements effective for enhancing low-temperature sinterability, chemical stability in a high-temperature region, denseness and mechanical strength. Although not studied in Patent Literature 1, catalytic activity has been confirmed in some of the above transition metal elements themselves or in compounds containing such transition metal elements. For example, nickel is used as an SOFC fuel electrode.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As a proton conductive material, Patent Literature 2 provides an oxide with a perovskite-type structure represented by the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-p</sub>.

Here, the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-p </sub>satisfies 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;p&#x3c;1.5. In the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-p</sub>, M is a trivalent substitution element. The substitution element M is at least one element selected from La, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Y, Sc, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Al, Ga and In.

For example, nickel is used as an SOFC fuel electrode.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present inventors then carried out extensive studies on the proton conductive materials disclosed in Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2, and have consequently found the following.

With respect to the arc drawn in the Nyquist plot in the range of frequencies of about 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, a real number was obtained from the intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side to the end on the low frequency side. In a fuel cell, the reaction resistance acquired by the AC impedance method usually shows two separate semicircular waveforms for the positive electrode and the negative electrode. The evaluation cell used in this measurement, however, had the same materials on both sides. Therefore, the results obtained in this measurement are an overlap of the current responses of the air electrodes. Thus, the real number was halved to consider the electrode activity per side, and the halved real number was taken as the reaction resistance. Incidentally, the reaction resistance is an energy loss required for electron transfer in an electrochemical reaction at an electrode. The resistance that was calculated probably had correlation with the activity of the electrode. Thus, the electrode activity was evaluated as good or poor based on the magnitude of the resistance calculated.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0143">The following is a reference to the specific procedures for evaluating the reaction resistance.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0144">(i) When the arc drawn in the Nyquist plot in the range of frequencies of about 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz had an intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side (for example, I<sub>1 </sub>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>): A real number (for example, R1 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) was obtained from the intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side to the end on the low frequency side (for example, 12 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).

In other words, the peaks of the electrode material produced by the method according to EXAMPLE 1 had shifts of about +2 degrees at a maximum from the peaks assigned to BaZrO<sub>3</sub>.

Depending on the composition, the electrode materials that included a compound represented by the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x-y</sub>In<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub> (0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, (x+y)&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;&#x3b4;&#x3c;1) had a reaction resistance lower than the reaction resistance of the electrode material of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2. Specifically, it has been found that the electrode material of the present disclosure may achieve a lower reaction resistance than the conventional electrode material having excellent electrode activity as an oxide ion-electron mixed conductor. More specifically, the values of reaction resistance of the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9, EXAMPLE 10, EXAMPLE 14, EXAMPLE 16 and EXAMPLE 17 were lower than the reaction resistance of the electrode material of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2. The reason is probably because the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9, EXAMPLE 10, EXAMPLE 14, EXAMPLE 16 and EXAMPLE 17 are proton-electron mixed conductors. In the evaluation of the reaction resistance, the material used for the electrolyte membrane was a proton conductive material, specifically, BaZr<sub>0.8</sub>Yb<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub> (wherein 0&#x3c;&#x3b4;&#x3c;0.5). When this electrolyte membrane is used in combination with an electrode material having no proton conductivity as is the case in COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2, the region where the reaction proceeds is the interface at which electrons conducted through the electrode, protons conducted through the electrolyte membrane, and oxygen gas come into contact with one another (that is, the three-phase interface). For example, the oxygen gas that is used here may be oxygen gas derived from air or may be a synthetic gas obtained by mixing oxygen and other gas such as nitrogen in any ratio. When, on the other hand, the electrode material has proton conductivity, the reaction also proceeds at the surface of the electrode particles (that is, also at the two-phase interface). Provided that the cell sizes are the same, the area of the three-phase interface is generally smaller than the area of the two-phase interface. Thus, as is the case in EXAMPLE 1, the electrode material of the present disclosure used in a cell including a proton conductive electrolyte membrane allows the cell to exhibit a superior electrode performance. The use of cells including the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9, EXAMPLE 10, EXAMPLE 14, EXAMPLE 16 and EXAMPLE 17 is expected to offer high electrode activity in various electrochemical devices. The electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9, EXAMPLE 10, EXAMPLE 14, EXAMPLE 16 and EXAMPLE 17 are expected to offer a high output when used in a fuel cell. The values of reaction resistance of the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9 and EXAMPLE 14 were lower than 0.13. Thus, the use of cells including the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9 and EXAMPLE 14 is expected to offer higher electrode activity in various electrochemical devices. The electrode materials of EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 9 and EXAMPLE 14 are expected to offer a higher output when used in a fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Reaction</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Compound</entry><entry>Single</entry><entry>resistance</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Composition</entry><entry>Value of x</entry><entry>Value of y</entry><entry>compound</entry><entry>[&#x3a9;cm<sup>2</sup>]</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>EX. 1</entry><entry>BaZr<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>In<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub></entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.05</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 2</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.625</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 3</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>5.76</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 4</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 5</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 6</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 7</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>0.750</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 8</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>1.44</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 9</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.12</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 10</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.44</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 11</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>1.65</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 12</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>0.625</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 13</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.75</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 14</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.08</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 15</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>1.12</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 16</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.31</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 17</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.46</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 18</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.500</entry><entry>0.375</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>0.8</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 19</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.625</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>4.89</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 20</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.625</entry><entry>0.250</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>EX. 21</entry><entry>Ditto</entry><entry>0.750</entry><entry>0.125</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry>COMP.

With respect to the arc drawn in the Nyquist plot in the range of frequencies of about 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, a real number was obtained from the intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side to the end on the low frequency side. In a fuel cell, the reaction resistance acquired by the AC impedance method usually shows two separate semicircular waveforms for the positive electrode and the negative electrode. The evaluation cell used in this measurement, however, had the same materials on both sides. Therefore, the results obtained in this measurement are an overlap of the current responses of the air electrodes. Thus, the real number was halved to consider the electrode activity per side, and the halved real number was taken as the reaction resistance. Incidentally, the reaction resistance is an energy loss required for electron transfer in an electrochemical reaction at an electrode. The resistance that was calculated probably had correlation with the activity of the electrode. Thus, the electrode activity was evaluated as good or poor based on the magnitude of the resistance calculated.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0343">The following is a reference to the specific procedures for evaluating the reaction resistance.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0344">(i) When the arc drawn in the Nyquist plot in the range of frequencies of about 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz had an intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side (for example, I<sub>3 </sub>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>): A real number (for example, R4 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) was obtained from the intersection of the arc and the real axis on the high frequency side to the end on the low frequency side (for example, 14 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>).

The electrode material including a Co-containing compound represented by the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x-y</sub>Yb<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4; </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, (x+y)&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;&#x3b4;&#x3c;1) successfully realized a lower reaction resistance than BaZr<sub>1-x</sub>M<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-p</sub>. Specifically, the electrode materials of EXAMPLES 22 to 48 had a low reaction resistance as compared with BaZr<sub>0.8</sub>Yb<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4; </sub>of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0620">Depending on the composition, the electrode materials that included a compound represented by the chemical formula BaZr<sub>1-x-y</sub>Yb<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4; </sub>(0&#x3c;x&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, (x+y)&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;&#x3b4;&#x3c;1) had a reaction resistance lower than the reaction resistance of the electrode material of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2. Specifically, it has been found that the electrode material of the present disclosure may achieve a lower reaction resistance than the conventional electrode material having excellent electrode activity as an oxide ion-electron mixed conductor. More specifically, the values of reaction resistance of the electrodes of EXAMPLE 22, EXAMPLES 25 to 41, and EXAMPLES 44 to 48 were lower than the reaction resistance of the electrode of COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2. The reason behind this result is probably because the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 22, EXAMPLES 25 to 41, and EXAMPLES 44 to 48 are proton-electron mixed conductors. In the evaluation of the reaction resistance, the material used for the electrolyte membrane was a proton conductive material, specifically, BaZr<sub>0.8</sub>Yb<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2.9</sub>. When this electrolyte membrane is used in combination with an electrode material having no proton conductivity as is the case in COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3, the region where the reaction proceeds is the interface at which electrons conducted through the electrode, protons conducted through the electrolyte membrane, and oxygen gas come into contact with one another (that is, the three-phase interface). For example, the oxygen gas that is used here may be oxygen gas derived from air or may be a synthetic gas obtained by mixing oxygen and other gas such as nitrogen in any ratio. When, on the other hand, the electrode material has proton conductivity, the reaction also proceeds at the surface of the electrode particles (that is, also at the two-phase interface). Provided that the cell sizes are the same, the area of the three-phase interface is generally smaller than the area of the two-phase interface. Thus, as is the case in EXAMPLE 22, the electrode material of the present disclosure used in a cell including a proton conductive electrolyte membrane allows the cell to exhibit a superior electrode performance. The use of cells including the electrode materials of EXAMPLE 22, EXAMPLES 25 to 41, and EXAMPLES 44 to 48 is expected to offer high electrode activity in various electrochemical devices. The electrode materials of EXAMPLE 22, EXAMPLES 25 to 41, and EXAMPLES 44 to 48 are expected to offer a high output when used in a fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0621">In the embodiments and EXAMPLES described hereinabove, the values of x and y indicate the amounts added and may differ from the measured values by a margin of error of greater than or equal to &#x2212;0.02 and less than or equal to +0.02.
