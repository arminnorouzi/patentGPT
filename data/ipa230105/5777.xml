The workpieces may comprise, for instance, glass plates, films, ribbons, solar panels, mirrors, liquid crystal displays, semiconductor wafers, and the like. Many different types of process chambers are available, for instance, for processing semiconductor wafers during the manufacture of integrated circuit chips.

Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Aspects of the present disclosure are discussed with reference to a &#x201c;workpiece&#x201d; &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; or semiconductor wafer for purposes of illustration and discussion. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that the example aspects of the present disclosure can be used in association with any semiconductor workpiece or other suitable workpiece. In addition, the use of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in conjunction with a numerical value is intended to refer to within ten percent (10%) of the stated numerical value. A &#x201c;pedestal&#x201d; refers to any structure that can be used to support a workpiece. A &#x201c;remote plasma&#x201d; refers to a plasma generated remotely from a workpiece, such as in a plasma chamber separated from a workpiece by a separation grid. A &#x201c;direct plasma&#x201d; refers to a plasma that is directly exposed to a workpiece, such as a plasma generated in a processing chamber having a pedestal operable to support the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, use of the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; in conjunction with a stated numerical value can include a range of values within 10% of the stated numerical value.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Conventional plasma processing apparatuses include a workpiece support that can include an electrostatic chuck. Generally, an electrostatic chuck includes one or more electrodes embedded in a ceramic puck. When the electrode is charged with electricity, differences in the electrostatic charges in the electrode and the workpiece will hold the workpiece on the workpiece support. Existing electrostatic chucks include monopolar (e.g., a single electrode) or dipolar (e.g., to electrodes) designs. However, the present inventors have discovered that electrostatic forces generated by the electrodes can create process non-uniformities on the workpiece. For example, existing bipolar electrostatic chucks can cause side-to-side etch rate non-uniformity patterns due to the layout of the electrodes, which have a clear side-to-side pattern in electric field distribution due to the connections of the electrodes to their respective power source or sources.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, example aspects of the present disclosure provide for a unique radial layout for the chucking (e.g., clamping) electrodes. The chucking electrodes can be thermally isolated and electrically connected in a manner resulting in a total of four isolated zones in the chucking electrodes. In general, example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to an electrostatic chuck that includes a clamping layer having one or more clamping electrodes. The clamping electrodes include a first clamping electrode defining a first clamping zone and a second clamping zone. The clamping electrodes include a second clamping electrode defining a third clamping zone and a fourth clamping zone. The first clamping zone and the second clamping zone are separated by a first gap. The first clamping zone and second clamping zone are electrically connected by at least one electrical connection extending across the first gap. The third clamping zone and the fourth clamping zone are separated by a second gap. The third clamping zone and fourth clamping zone are electrically connected by at least one electrical connection extending across the second gap.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first and second clamping electrodes are disposed in a radial manner such that the first clamping zone is radially most inward, the second clamping zone is radially inward from the third clamping zone and radially outward from the first clamping zone, and the third clamping zone is radially inward from the fourth clamping zone and radially outward from the second clamping zone. The clamping zones can correspond to the placement of one or more heating zones defined in a heating layer with heating electrodes.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, the electrostatic chuck can include a thermal control system. The thermal control system can include a layer disposed in the chuck in order to distribute a thermal exchange fluid or gas (e.g., helium). The thermal control system can include one or more flow channels that are interconnected to one or more release apertures disposed in certain release zones. For example, in embodiments, the release zones of apertures can be disposed in a radial pattern corresponding to the clamping zones and/or heating zones. For example, the first zone of release apertures can be located radially most inward and the second zone of release apertures can be located radially outward from the first zone of release apertures. The third zone of release apertures can be located radially outward from the second zone of release apertures and radially inward from the fourth zone of release apertures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain implementations, the electrostatic chuck can also include a sealing band. The sealing band generally sits atop at least a portion of the workpiece support surface of the electrostatic chuck, more specifically the sealing band surround an outer perimeter of the electrostatic chuck. The sealing band is configured to have a width W1 that is greater than about 3 millimeters (mm) up tot about 10 mm. Sizing the sealing band according to example aspects of the present disclosure, provides a more robust sealing band that is better able to withstand processing and cleaning conditions without being damaged such that leakage of heat exchange gas likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electrostatic chuck according to example embodiments of the present disclosure can provide numerous benefits and technical effects. For instance, at least two clamping electrodes can be radially arranged and connected resulting in at least four thermally isolated zones. Each thermally isolated zone can be controlled in order to improve process uniformity. Additionally, electrostatic chuck bias compensation (e.g., chucking voltage offset) can be used to actively control the etch rate uniformity and/or chemical deposition on workpieces during processing. Furthermore, disposing certain heating zones and/or zones of release apertures as provided can further enhance temperature control in the radial and azimuthal directions across the workpiece. Further, sizing the sealing band as provided herein, ensures that the sealing band is more durable and is less susceptible to erosion from plasma exposure and, therefore, less likely to leak heat exchange gas around the perimeter of the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, for instance, one embodiment of a workpiece processing system <b>100</b> made in accordance with the present disclosure is shown. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system includes a process chamber <b>9</b>. The process chamber <b>9</b> includes a workpiece processing station <b>13</b>. The processing station <b>13</b> includes a workpiece support <b>12</b> made in accordance with the present disclosure. The process chamber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes one processing station <b>13</b> for processing one workpiece, such as a semiconductor wafer. It should be understood, however, that the process chamber <b>9</b> may include more than one processing station in other embodiments. As shown, the processing station <b>13</b> includes a processing region <b>14</b>. The processing region <b>14</b> is in communication with an isolation valve <b>17</b>. Isolation valve <b>17</b> opens and closes so as to allow the workpiece to be exchanged. The isolation valve <b>17</b> seals to the process chamber wall <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiment illustrated, the workpiece support <b>12</b>, or at least a portion of the workpiece support, includes an electrostatic chuck <b>24</b>. Electrostatic chucks <b>24</b> are configured to produce an electrostatic force that holds a workpiece <b>16</b> onto the top surface of the workpiece support <b>12</b>. More particularly, the electrostatic chucks function by applying one, monopolar, or two, bipolar, high DC voltages between an electrostatic chuck and the workpiece. For instance, two, bipolar DC voltages cause both positive and negative charges on one side of the first dielectric layer <b>28</b>. These charges, generate attractive Coulomb forces between the top surface of the workpiece support <b>12</b> and a workpiece <b>16</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the workpiece support <b>12</b> includes a clamping layer having one or more clamping electrodes that enables the electrostatic chuck function. It should be understood, however, that the teachings and principles of the present disclosure are also applicable to other workpiece supports that do not necessarily comprise electrostatic chucks.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The processing station <b>13</b> is configured to receive a workpiece <b>16</b> on the workpiece support <b>12</b>. Once the workpiece <b>16</b>, such as a semiconductor wafer, is loaded into the process chamber, the workpiece <b>16</b> is subjected to an energy source in order for the workpiece <b>16</b> to undergo a desirable physical and/or chemical change. Energy sources that may be used to process workpieces can include, for instance, an ion source, a reactive chemical source, a thermal source, a plasma source, or mixtures thereof. Thermal sources that may be used to subject the workpieces to energy include light energy sources, such as, plasma arc lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, microwave, inductive, resistive heaters, or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In certain embodiments, process chamber <b>10</b> includes a plasma source for subjecting a workpiece to a plasma. The plasma is supplied by means of one or more induction coils <b>39</b> that are in communication with a RF impedance matching device (not shown) and in communication with a RF power supply (not shown). While only one induction coil <b>39</b> is shown, the disclosure is not so limited. Indeed any number of induction coils could be provided in order to generate a plasma in the process chamber <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The workpiece processing system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided for purposes of illustration and discussion. Those of ordinary skill in the art, using the disclosures provided herein, will understand that the electrostatic chuck(s) according to example aspects of the present disclosure can be used in any suitable processing system (e.g., any suitable plasma processing system).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as shown, the workpiece support <b>12</b> includes a workpiece-receiving surface <b>18</b> that is defined by a dielectric portion <b>20</b>. The dielectric portion <b>20</b> is positioned on top of a base that, in this embodiment, includes a first base portion <b>22</b> positioned over a second base portion <b>15</b>. In embodiments, the combination of dielectric portion <b>20</b>, first base portion <b>22</b>, and second base portion <b>15</b> can be referred to as the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b>. The electrostatic chuck <b>24</b>, and representative layers, is made from any suitable metallic or ceramic material. For instance, in one embodiment, the base portions <b>22</b> and <b>15</b> can be made from aluminum. The electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> can also include alumina, aluminum nitride, yttria, zirconia, and/or any other chemically resistant ceramic or plastic material. The electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> is attached to a workpiece support pedestal <b>57</b>. The purpose of the pedestal <b>57</b> is to provide rigid mechanical support for the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> and to provide both thermal and electrical isolation from the process chamber <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the dielectric portion <b>20</b> is positioned on top of the first base portion <b>22</b> and defines the workpiece-receiving surface <b>18</b>. The dielectric portion <b>20</b> can be made from any suitable dielectric material, such as a ceramic material. The dielectric portion can comprise multiple layers of a dielectric material or can comprise a single layer. In the embodiment the dielectric portion <b>20</b> includes a first dielectric layer <b>28</b> positioned on top of a second and thicker second dielectric layer <b>30</b>. The first dielectric layer <b>28</b>, for instance, can have a thickness of about 0.4 to about 1 mm, while the second dielectric layer <b>30</b> can have a thickness of from about 2 mm to about 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the workpiece support <b>12</b> can further be in communication with an RF conduit <b>36</b> that is in communication with an RF impedance matching device (not shown) in communication with an RF power supply <b>38</b> for supplying an RF bias power to the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an alternative embodiment, the RF source power can be coupled to the workpiece support <b>12</b> through an RF impedance matching device (not shown) that is in communication with a RF conduit <b>36</b>. In this embodiment, there is no additional RF power supplied to the processing station <b>13</b>. In an alternative embodiment, no RF source power is coupled to the workpiece support <b>12</b>. During workpiece processing, the RF power source can be energized to produce ions and electrons in the plasma for desired chemical reactions with a top surface of the workpiece <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, the RF power source provides independent control of the energy that ions have when they strike the top surface of the workpiece. The RF power supply and the DC power supply can both be grounded using any suitable technique. In one embodiment, for instance, both RF and DC power supplies may be grounded to an electrode in communication with the processing chamber. In the embodiments illustrated, the process chamber employs inductive-coupled RF power to generate and maintain a plasma necessary for workpiece processing. The RF bias power is capacitively coupled to the plasma through the workpiece support <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to load and unload workpieces on the workpiece-receiving surface <b>18</b>, the workpiece support <b>12</b> can include any suitable mounting device.

The controller <b>175</b> controls various components in processing chamber <b>9</b> to direct processing of workpiece <b>16</b>. For example, controller <b>175</b> can be used to control power sources (e.g., DC power source, AC power source, and/or RF power source) connected to the electrodes in the clamping layer <b>40</b> and/or heating layer <b>50</b>. Additionally and/or alternatively, controller <b>175</b> can be used to control the thermal management system <b>70</b> in order to control or maintain a desired workpiece temperatures. The controller <b>175</b> can also implement one or more process parameters, such as controlling the gas flow controllers and/or altering conditions of the processing chamber <b>9</b> during processing of the workpiece <b>16</b>. The controller <b>175</b> can include, for instance, one or more processors and/or one or more memory devices. The one or more memory devices can store computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations, such as any of the control operations described herein.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> portion of the workpiece support <b>12</b> is shown.

For example, in embodiments, the clamping layer <b>40</b> can be positioned between the first dielectric layer <b>28</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>30</b>. The one or more clamping electrodes present in the clamping layer <b>40</b> can be placed in communication with a DC power supply <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Two different DC voltages can be supplied by a single DC power supply or by two independent power supplies. The DC power supply <b>34</b> supplies the voltages necessary to create an electric field for producing electrostatic attraction between the workpiece-receiving surface <b>18</b> and a workpiece <b>16</b> held on the surface. The amount of voltage created by the DC power supply can be used to adjust the amount of electrostatic attraction. Further, when it is necessary to remove the workpiece <b>16</b> from the workpiece support <b>12</b>, the DC power supply can be turned off so that no voltage is being produced or can create a reverse polarity voltage from the starting potential. DC voltages typically vary from about 500 to 2000 volts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the clamping layer <b>40</b> can include one or more electrodes, such as at least two electrodes <b>41</b>,<b>43</b>, disposed in radial arrangement. The first clamping electrode <b>41</b> can be coupled to a negative charge source, while the second clamping electrode <b>43</b> can be coupled to a positive charge source. In other embodiments, however, it is contemplated that either the first or second clamping electrode <b>41</b>,<b>43</b> could be coupled to either a positive or a negative charge source. For example, in embodiments, the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> is coupled to a negative DC voltage and the second clamping electrode <b>43</b> is coupled to a positive DC voltage. Furthermore, the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> and the second clamping electrode <b>43</b> can be coupled to a DC power source, AC power source, and/or a RF power source. In embodiments, both the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> and the second clamping electrode <b>43</b> can be coupled to the same RF power source.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the clamping layer <b>40</b> includes a first clamping electrode <b>41</b> and a second clamping electrode <b>43</b> disposed in radial arrangement. That is, the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> is disposed radially inward from the second clamping electrode <b>43</b>. The first clamping electrode <b>41</b> defines a first clamping zone <b>48</b> and a second clamping zone <b>46</b>. The second clamping electrode <b>43</b> defines a third clamping zone <b>44</b> and a fourth clamping zone <b>42</b>. As shown, the first clamping zone <b>48</b> is disposed radially most inward. The second clamping zone <b>46</b> is disposed radially outward from the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and radially inward from the third clamping zone <b>44</b>. The fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> is disposed radially most outward.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> can be thermally isolated from one another. For example, the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and the second clamping zone <b>46</b> can be separated by a gap <b>45</b><i>a</i>. The third clamping zone <b>44</b> and the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> can also be separated by a gap <b>45</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, gap <b>45</b><i>a </i>reduces thermal conduction between the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and the second clamping zone <b>46</b> and the second gap <b>45</b><i>b </i>reduces thermal conduction between the third clamping zone <b>44</b> and the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b>. The gaps <b>45</b><i>a</i>,<b>45</b><i>b </i>can include an air gap or can comprise any suitable material. For example, in certain embodiments, the gaps <b>45</b><i>a</i>,<b>45</b><i>b </i>comprise a dielectric material (e.g., ceramic material).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">One or more electrical connections <b>47</b> can be used to couple first clamping zone <b>48</b> with the second clamping zone <b>46</b>. For example, a plurality of electrical connections <b>47</b> can be used, such as at least five electrical connections <b>47</b>. Similarly, one or more electrical connections <b>49</b> can be used to couple the third clamping zone <b>44</b> to the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b>. The number of electrical connections <b>49</b> can include more than 1, such as more than 5, such as more than 10. In certain embodiments, the number of electrical connections <b>47</b> connecting the first and second clamping zones <b>48</b>,<b>46</b> can be less than the number of electrical connections <b>49</b> connecting the third and fourth clamping zones <b>44</b>, <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">While each of the two clamping electrodes <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> are thermally isolated into two zones each, they are connected via the electrical connection <b>47</b> or <b>49</b> in order to keep them at approximately the same electrical potential. For example, in embodiments, the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and second clamping zone <b>46</b> carry the same chucking voltage for the positive pole, while the third clamping zone <b>44</b> and fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> carry the same chucking voltage for the negative pole. Generally, the offset between the positive chucking voltage and the negative chucking voltage can either target balancing the clamping forces in order to compensate for a self-DC bias on the workpiece or can be purposely operated in an unbalanced mode for uniformity tuning purposes. For example, a workpiece can be processed and the uniformity of the workpiece can be assessed. Upon assessment if uniformity is at issue, the electrostatic chuck bias can be adjusted in order to adjust workpiece uniformity for workpieces processed in the future. For example, the clamping voltage of either the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> or the second clamping electrode <b>43</b> can be adjusted in order to adjust workpiece uniformity.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, as noted, the clamping electrodes <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> can be connected to any suitable power source or voltage source (e.g., a DC power source or an RF power source). In certain embodiments, the clamping electrodes <b>41</b>,<b>43</b> are coupled to a voltage source (e.g., a high DC voltage source) the voltage source is configured to provide a DC offset ad adjustment to balance one or more clamping forces or to adjust workpiece processing uniformity. In certain configurations, the clamping electrodes are coupled to a bipolar high voltage supply (e.g., a bipolar high DC voltage supply). In certain configurations, each of the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and/or <b>48</b> can be operated independently from each other in order to adjust workpiece uniformity. For instance, in embodiments, a different amount of power output and/or a different power source itself can be applied to any of the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> in order to adjust workpiece uniformity. For example, a different amount of DC voltage, RF power output, and/or a different power source can be applied to any of the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> in order to adjust workpiece uniformity. For example, in certain embodiments, application of different amounts of DC voltage and/or RF power applied across the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can modify the clamping electrodes <b>41</b>,<b>43</b> so as to provide a tri-polar or quadra-polar electrostatic chuck. Furthermore, the clamping electrodes can be connected to a DC power source or an RF power source with one or more capacitors disposed along the RF path in order to prevent DC voltage from interfering with or accessing the RF delivery. Additionally or alternatively, an inductor and/or resistor in series can be disposed in the DC path to prevent RF voltage from accessing the DC voltage supply.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Additionally, one or more traces can be utilized in order to arrange the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> in any type of electrical configuration. For example, the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and the third clamping zone <b>44</b>, could be electrically coupled to one or more traces embedded in a layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> to form the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> and the second clamping zone <b>46</b> and the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> could be electrically coupled to one or more traces embedded in a layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> to form the second clamping electrode <b>43</b>. Moreover, in embodiments, the first clamping zone <b>48</b> and the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> could be electrically coupled to one or more traces embedded in a layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> to form the first clamping electrode <b>41</b> and the second clamping zone <b>46</b> and third clamping zone <b>44</b> could be electrically coupled to one or more traces embedded in a layer of the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> to form the second clamping electrode <b>43</b>. In such embodiments, the traces used to connect different clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can be located generally in a layer of the electrostatic chuck that is underneath of the clamping layer <b>40</b>. Once the selected clamping zones are coupled via a trace, the trace can then be connected to any suitable power source as described herein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one or more embodiments, a heating layer <b>50</b> can be disposed in the workpiece support <b>12</b>.

For example, the heating layer <b>50</b> can include one or more electrodes <b>51</b>, such as a plurality of electrodes <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, <b>51</b><i>c</i>, <b>51</b><i>d </i>arranged in a radial pattern. For example, in certain embodiments, the heating layer <b>50</b> includes at least four electrodes <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, <b>51</b><i>c</i>, <b>51</b><i>d</i>. Each of the electrodes <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, <b>51</b><i>c</i>, <b>51</b><i>d </i>can be connected to a suitable AC or DC power source. In certain embodiments, the plurality of heating electrodes <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, <b>51</b><i>c</i>, <b>51</b><i>d </i>are disposed in a radial manner to form a first heating zone <b>58</b>, a second heating zone <b>56</b>, a third heating zone <b>54</b>, and a fourth heating zone <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The heating zones <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> can be disposed in any manner on or within the heating layer <b>50</b> in the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the heating zones <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b> correspond to the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> present in the clamping layer <b>40</b>.

The third heating zone <b>54</b> is disposed under the third clamping zone <b>44</b> in the z-direction. The fourth heating zone <b>52</b> is disposed under the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b> in the z-direction. Additionally, the widths of the heating zones <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are substantially the same as the widths of the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. For example, the width of the first heating zone <b>58</b> is substantially the same as the width of the first clamping zone <b>48</b>. The width of the second heating zone <b>56</b> is substantially the same as the width of the second clamping zone <b>46</b>. The width of the third heating zone <b>54</b> is substantially the same as the width of the third clamping zone <b>44</b>. The width of the fourth heating zone <b>52</b> is substantially the same as the width of the fourth clamping zone <b>42</b>. Disposition of the heating zones <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> in relation to the clamping zones <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can help with thermal isolation from zone to zone radially.

The sealing band <b>80</b> generally surrounds an outer perimeter of the electrostatic chuck <b>24</b> including at least a portion of the workpiece-receiving surface <b>18</b>. The sealing band <b>80</b> is configured to have a width W1 that is greater than about 3 millimeters (mm) up to about 10 mm, such as greater than 4 mm up to about 9 mm, such as greater than 5 mm up to about 8 mm, such as greater than 5 mm, up to about 7 mm.

Further, electrostatic chucks often go through in-situ dry-cleaning (ISD) and can further go through off-situ cleaning during maintenance. If the sealing band is damaged or worn after hours of use or during cleaning, such damage can cause leakage of thermal exchange gas (e.g., helium) such that the workpiece temperature is not maintained as it should be. Further, if thermal exchange gas (e.g., helium) is able to seep out and around the sealing band such that it has access to the top of the workpiece during process, this can cause further uniformity issues during workpiece processing. Accordingly, the width W1 of the sealing band <b>80</b> provided herein is such that the sealing band <b>80</b> is more robust and is better able to withstand processing and cleaning conditions without being damaged such that leakage of thermal exchange gas is not likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the present subject matter has been described in detail with respect to specific example embodiments thereof, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, upon attaining an understanding of the foregoing may readily produce alterations to, variations of, and equivalents to such embodiments.
