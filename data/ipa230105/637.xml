No. 10-2020-0033336 filed on Mar. 18, 2020. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to a cage for minimally invasive surgery. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a cage for minimally invasive surgery, which is configured to be inserted into a space between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra so as to prevent subsidence thereof, to be rotated in the space between the vertebrae so as to increase the area of supporting the vertebrae, and to increase an interval between vertebral bodies which is narrowed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, in the case of conventional laparotomy for treating a patient, the patient's recovery after surgery is slow due to a large incision site and a large amount of bleeding that occurs during surgery, and after surgery, a large scar remains, which affects the patient's life after the surgery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to overcome the shortcomings of the laparoscopic surgery, a new surgical technique of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in which a laparoscopic surgical instrument is used is being developed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The minimally invasive surgery is a surgical technique in which only a minimal part is incised on a patient's body surface by using a long and thin surgical instrument specially designed to minimize an incised part required for surgery.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the minimally invasive surgery, fewer incisions for a procedure are required, and the amount of bleeding during the procedure is significantly less than that of laparotomy, so a period for which a patient is recovered after the surgery is short and the patient has small external scars, so the number of such procedures has increased significantly in recent years.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, disc that exists between a vertebra and a bone functions as a joint and plays a very important role in minimizing impact applied to the vertebra as the position and shape of nucleus pulposus accommodated inside the disc changes according to the movement of the vertebra.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Most of the nucleus pulposus consists of water (water), but as a person ages, the amount of water gradually decreases and the disc loses its cushioning function.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to this, when excessive pressure is applied to fibers, back pain occurs, and when it progresses further, the fibers are severely stretched or ruptured and press nerve roots located behind the fibers, causing pain in the pelvis and legs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">After that, various side effects occur, such as an interval between the vertebrae gradually narrows or vertebral bones subside, resulting in spinal deformity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a method of treating diseases accompanied by damage to the disc, there is a method in which space between two adjacent vertebrae is replaced with a prosthetic material, which is a so-called cage, after the damaged intervertebral disc is removed. That is, the prosthetic material restores spinal function by restoring an original distance between two adjacent vertebral bodies, which is the original height of the intervertebral disc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As a surgical method of inserting such a prosthetic material between vertebrae, there are anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), which inserts a prosthetic material from the front of the spine, lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF), which inserts a prosthetic material through the flank, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (LIF), which inserts a prosthetic material in a diagonal direction at a distance of 30 to 40 mm from the center of the rear side of the back, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), which inserts a prosthetic material from the rear side of the back.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">From the above point of view, &#x201c;EXPANDABLE CAGE BETWEEN VERTEBRAL BODIES&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;Prior art 1&#x201d;) is disclosed in Korean Patent No. 10-1352820.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Prior art 1 discloses an expandable cage between vertebral bodies which is inserted into a space between vertebral bodies so as to expand the space between vertebral bodies. The expandable cage includes: a cage body including an upper support part which is located at an upper part between the vertebral bodies so as to support the vertebral bodies, a lower support part which is located at a lower part between the vertebral bodies supports so as to support the vertebral bodies, and a connection part connecting the upper support part with the end of the lower support part; and a sliding member which increases or decreases an interval between the upper support part and the lower support part by sliding between the upper support part and the lower support part.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For reference, all bones including vertebrae are generally composed of the outermost cortical bone composed of dense and hard tissues, and the spongy bone composed of sparse tissues at the inner side of the cortical bone.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, most of cages, including the cage of Prior art 1, do not support a part of the cortical bone, so as a long time passes after a procedure, subsidence occurs in which a cage is buried in the spongy bone.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to solve the above problem, Korean Patent No. 10-1730476 discloses &#x201c;SPINAL IMPLANT WITH JOINT FOR MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY&#x201d; (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;Prior art 2&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In Prior art 2, a spinal implant includes: a body unit inserted into a space between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra, first and second end parts of the body unit being rotatable to each other relative to a middle part between the first and second end parts; a rotation auxiliary unit which is formed on the middle part of the body unit and provides the reference point of the rotation of the first end part and the second end part to each other; and an operation unit inserted from the second end part of the body unit, the operation unit embodying the relative rotations of the first end part and the second end part to each other by being engaged with the rotation auxiliary unit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, the spinal implant of Prior art 2 has an advantage in that the spinal implant can rotate inside space between vertebrae to stably support upper and lower vertebral bodies, but a configuration required to perform the relative rotations of the first and second end parts of the body unit to each other are complicated, and a surgeon is required to use a separately designed surgical instrument so as to operate the operation unit of the body unit.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above problemsby providing a cage for minimally invasive surgery in which a pair of support bodies is rotated to each other inside space between vertebral bodies by a surgeon's simple manipulation so as to secure a sufficient support area, and is dilated even in a vertical direction so as to prevent subsidence between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A cage for minimally invasive surgery according to the present disclosure includes: a main body part inserted into a space between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra, and having lengthwise first and second end parts connected rotatably to each other; and a dilatation induction part provided in an inner space of the main body part, the dilatation induction part being configured to dilate a lengthwise middle part of the main body part by moving to a position at which the first and second end parts of the main body part are connected to each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the main body part may be rectilinearly inserted into the space between the vertebra and the adjacent vertebra, and when a front end part of the main body part is in contact with a tissue disposed in the space, the first and second end parts of the main body part may be rotated to each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, the main body part may include: a first support body whose first end part is initially inserted into a space between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra, the first support body having a first space part formed therein; and a second support body whose first end part is connected rotatably to a second end part of the first support body, the second support body having a second space part communicable with the first space part formed therein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, while the dilatation induction part is received in the second space part, the dilatation induction part may be moved to a position at which the first support body and the second support body are connected to each other, and may dilate the second end part of the first support body and the first end part of the second support body in upward and downward directions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, when the dilatation induction part is moved to the position at which the first support body and the second support body are connected to each other, an upper surface of the first support body may be disposed to be inclined upward from a first end of the first support body toward a second end thereof, and a lower surface of the first support body may be disposed to be inclined downward from the first end of the first support body toward the second end thereof, and an upper surface of the second support body may be disposed to be inclined downward from a first end of the second support body toward a second end thereof, and a lower surface of the second support body may be disposed to be inclined upward from the first end of the second support body toward the second end thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the dilatation induction part may include: a moving block received in the second space part; and a connecting body provided on a second end part of the moving block, the connecting body being exposed to an outside at a second end part of the second support body and being connected to a surgical instrument.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, the connecting body may include: an insertion member inserted into an insertion hole famed in the second end part of the moving block; and a coupling member connected with the insertion member and having a diameter larger than a diameter of the insertion member, the coupling member being exposed to the outside at the second end part of the second support body and being coupled to a front end part of the surgical instrument.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, a coupling groove into which the front end part of the surgical instrument is inserted may be formed in a second surface of the coupling member.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, a threaded part may be formed on an outer circumferential surface of the coupling member.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, a guide hole through which the coupling member passes may be formed in the second end part of the second support body, and a threaded part may be formed on an inner circumferential surface of the second end part of the second support body which partitions the guide hole such that the threaded part formed on the inner circumferential surface is coupled to the threaded part formed on the outer circumferential surface of the coupling member.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, a gripping groove gripped by the surgical instrument may be formed in the second end part of the second support body.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the cage may further include: a rotating part provided at a position at which the first support body and the second support body are connected to each other, wherein the rotating part may include: a pair of rotating plates; a rotating pin foiled on each of the rotating plates; and a through hole through which the rotating pin is rotatably inserted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, a distance between the pair of rotating plates spaced apart from each other may be smaller than a thickness of the moving block.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, the cage may further include: a movement prevention means provided on a surface of the lengthwise second end part of the first support body and a surface of the lengthwise first end part of the second support body which are in contact with each other by facing each other, wherein the movement prevention means may be configured to have a sawtooth shape in which ridges and grooves are continuously formed, the movement prevention means being arranged circumferentially around the rotating pin and circumferentially around the through hole.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cage for minimally invasive surgery according to the present disclosure is provided with the main body part configured such that the lengthwise first and second end parts of the main body part are rotatable while the main body part is rectilinearly inserted into a space between a vertebra and an adjacent vertebra, thereby increasing the area of supporting vertebrae so as to effectively prevent subsidence thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, due to the dilatation induction part which slides inside the main body part and dilates the lengthwise middle part of the main body part in upward and downward directions, the cage for minimally invasive surgery according to the present disclosure can support vertebrae more stably and can flexibly respond to weight, impact, and torsional stress caused by various movements, which are applied to a vertebra of a person which undergoes a surgical procedure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the cage for minimally invasive surgery according to the present disclosure has a simple structure in which the lengthwise first and second end parts of the main body part are rotatable to each other and the lengthwise middle part of the main body part is dilatable, thereby increasing a surgeon's surgical convenience and improving a surgical success rate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

That is, the insertion member <b>321</b>&#x2032; is in contact with the inner surface of the moving block <b>310</b> in a state in which the insertion member <b>321</b>&#x2032; is opened so as not to pass through the insertion hole <b>311</b>, and accordingly, the moving block <b>310</b> and the connecting body <b>320</b> may be coupled to each other such that the moving block <b>310</b> and the connecting body <b>320</b> are not separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Particularly, the insertion member <b>321</b>&#x2032; according to another embodiment of the present disclosure enables a worker to couple the connecting body <b>320</b> and the moving block <b>310</b> to each other in a one-touch method even without using a component such as the fixing pin P described in the embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Although the specific embodiments according to the present disclosure have been described so far, the embodiments may be variously modified without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, the pair of rotating plates <b>410</b> of the rotating part <b>400</b> is formed integrally with the second support body <b>220</b>, and correspondingly, the through hole <b>430</b> is formed in the first support body <b>210</b>. This is described in the specification of the present disclosure and is illustrated in the drawing, but is not limited thereto. That is, the pair of rotating plates <b>410</b> may be provided integrally with the lengthwise second end part of the first support body <b>210</b>, and correspondingly, the through hole <b>430</b> may be formed in the lengthwise first end part of the second support body <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">However, in order to easily move the moving block <b>310</b> received in the second space part S<b>2</b> of the second support body <b>220</b> to the connection position of the first support body <b>210</b> and the second support body <b>220</b> to each other, it is preferable that the pair of rotating plates <b>410</b> is provided integrally with the lengthwise first end part of the second support body <b>220</b>, and correspondingly, the through hole <b>430</b> is formed in the lengthwise second end part of the first support body <b>210</b>. This is because when the pair of rotating plates <b>410</b> is provided on the first support body <b>210</b>, the moving block <b>310</b> interferes with a free end of each of the rotating plates <b>410</b> during the movement of the moving block <b>310</b>, so the moving block <b>310</b> does not naturally move. Accordingly, it is preferable that the pair of rotating plates <b>410</b> of the rotating part <b>400</b> is provided integrally with the lengthwise first end part of the second support body <b>22</b>, and correspondingly, the through hole <b>430</b> is formed in the lengthwise second end part of the first support body <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Therefore, the scope of the present disclosure should not be limited to the described embodiments, but should be defined by the claims to be described later and equivalents thereto.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The cage for minimally invasive surgery of the present disclosure may be applied to and sold in the medical industry.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
