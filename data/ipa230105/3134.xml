By adding an afterburner to an existing turbojet, for example, the maximum thrust can be significantly augmented. A General Electric J85-GE-21 afterburning turbojet generates 3,500 lbf thrust with the afterburner off and 5,000 lbf thrust, or 43% more thrust, with the afterburner on and can operate with the afterburner section turned off or on.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While an afterburning turbojet produces a great deal of thrust, there remains a need for propulsion systems that can provide higher thrust-to-weight ratios, and thus enable aerospace vehicles to fly at higher flight speeds and altitudes, compared with existing afterburning turbojets.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An air-turborocket, or Air Turbo Rocket (ATR), also known as an air-turboramjet, a fan-boosted ramjet, and gas generator turbojet motor, is a turbojet engine in which ram air compression is supplemented by a compressor powered by a turbine that is driven by the exhaust of a gas generator using a fuel rich liquid or solid propellant. The turbine exhaust gases constitute the fuel, which is burned with compressed air behind the turbine. While the ATR provides certain advantages relative to turbojets, including high speed flight and high thrust to weight ratio, the ratio of thrust to propellant flowrate is lower than that of turbojet engines.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, examples of the present invention preferably seek to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more deficiencies, disadvantages or issues in the art, such as the above-identified, singly or in any combination by providing a device according to the appended patent claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides an engine, named an Overjet engine, that is capable of operating in an Air Turbo Rocket (ATR) propulsion mode in addition to a turbojet mode and/or afterburning turbojet mode. A turbojet or afterburning turbojet with an ATR mode resembles its conventional counterpart, but with improved performance depending on the mode of operation. Improved performance comprises at least one of greater thrust and the ability to fly at higher altitudes in ATR mode when compared with a turbojet or an afterburning turbojet. The ability to selectively operate in a turbojet mode, an afterburner mode, and/or an ATR mode selectively provides the advantages of turbojet modes of operation and ATR mode operation in the same engine. While operating in turbojet mode, for example, an Overjet engine generates less thrust and is more fuel efficient than an ATR engine or an Overjet operating in an ATR mode.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the invention provides a method for operating an Overjet engine in turbojet mode, afterburning turbojet mode, ATR mode, and optionally combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a Duplex Turbine Guide Vane (DTVG) and a turbine assembly comprising DTVGs. A DTGV provides a means for directing hot, fuel rich gas from a gas generator onto the blades of a turbine.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides an ATR comprising a turbine assembly comprising DTGVs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides for a method for modifying an existing turbojet or afterburning turbojet to provide it with an ATR mode of operation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other aspects, features, and advantages of which examples of the invention are capable of will be apparent and elucidated from the following description of embodiments of the present invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of a prior art turbojet;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a graphical representation of a pressure profile of a prior art turbojet;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a graphical representation of a temperature profile of a prior art turbojet;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of a prior art afterburning turbojet;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a graphical representation of a pressure profile of a prior art afterburning turbojet;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a graphical representation of a temperature profile of a prior art afterburning turbojet;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of one embodiment of an Air Turbo Rocket (ATR);</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a graphical representation of a pressure profile of one embodiment of ATR;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a graphical representation of a temperature profile of one embodiment of an ATR;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of one embodiment of a turbojet comprising an ATR mode of operation;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graphical representation of a pressure profile of the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a graphical representation of a temperature profile the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> are schematic representations of three embodiments of ATR gas generator configurations;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective, cut away view of a turbine assembly comprising Duplex Turbine Guide Vanes (DTVGs) and turbine blades;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a magnified, cross-sectional view of a turbine inlet guide comprising DTGVs;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> are exterior and cross-section views of an embodiment of a DTGV; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> are side and perspective views of DTGVs and turbine blades;</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specific examples of the disclosure will now be described with reference to the Accompanying drawings. This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the examples set forth herein; rather, these examples are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. The terminology used in the detailed description of the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings is not intended to be limiting of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;gas generator&#x201d; means a gas generator that does not use air and the contents of the gas generator are isolated from exposure to air.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A turbojet <b>10</b> and an afterburning turbojet <b>20</b> are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A</figref>, respectively. Both engines comprise an air inlet <b>18</b>, a compressor <b>19</b>, a combustor <b>12</b>, a turbine <b>14</b>, and a nozzle <b>16</b>. Air enters the engine through the air inlet <b>18</b>, which corresponds to a relative position in the turbojet assigned position 1. Positions 1-5 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> correspond to relative positions in the turbojet <b>10</b> and afterburning turbojet <b>20</b> and are intended as an aid to explain technical effects of certain technical features of the invention. During normal operation of both the turbojet <b>10</b> and afterburning turbojet <b>20</b>, air is pressurized as it passes through the compressor <b>19</b> (positions 1 to 2) and the compressed air enters the combustor <b>12</b> where it mixes with fuel <b>11</b> and combustion occurs (positions 2-3). A stream of hot, high-pressure gas consisting primarily of air with combustion products expands over the turbine <b>14</b> which, in turn, drives the compressor <b>19</b> via shaft <b>17</b> (positions 3-4). In a turbojet <b>10</b>, remaining pressure is expanded through the nozzle <b>16</b> to generate thrust (positions 4-5). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, pressure in a turbojet reaches a maximum at positions 2-3 after incoming air has been compressed and during combustion. Pressure then drops as combustion exhaust drives the turbine <b>14</b> and exits through the nozzle <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates the temperature profile for a turbojet <b>10</b> in which temperature rises slightly during compression and then sharply in the combustor <b>12</b> before decreasing again as exhaust gas expands through the nozzle <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an afterburning turbojet <b>20</b>, gas exiting the turbine <b>14</b> enters the afterburner <b>22</b>, where additional fuel is mixed with the gas and burned to raise the temperature to a temperature higher than the temperature in the combustor <b>12</b>. Combustion products then expand through the exhaust nozzle <b>16</b> to produce thrust at a magnitude considerably greater than that produced by a non-afterburning turbojet.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> show pressure and temperature profiles for an afterburning turbojet <b>20</b> in which the afterburner <b>22</b> maintains a pressure lower than the combustor but achieves a higher maximum temperature.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In contrast to a turbojet, which uses power extracted from a reaction of fuel with air in the combustor <b>12</b> to drive the compressor <b>19</b>, an ATR <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) uses an independent gas source, such as a gas generator external to the combustor <b>12</b> to produce a hot, high-pressure, fuel-rich gas to drive turbine <b>14</b> and, in turn, the compressor <b>19</b>. Air exiting the compressor does not expand through a turbine and, instead, passes directly into a main combustion chamber <b>32</b> and, as a consequence, retains a higher gas pressure at the nozzle <b>16</b> when compared with a turbojet with an afterburner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a schematic view of one embodiment of an ATR <b>30</b> comprising an air inlet <b>18</b>, a compressor <b>19</b>, a gas generator <b>31</b>, a gas delivery conduit <b>36</b>, a turbine <b>14</b>, a main combustor <b>32</b>, and a nozzle <b>16</b>. Air entering at the inlet <b>18</b> is pressurized as it passes through the compressor <b>19</b> (positions 1-2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>) and passes directly into the main combustor (indicated by arrows outside the turbine <b>14</b> terminating between positions 3 and 4) without passing through the turbine <b>14</b>. Hot, high-pressure, fuel-rich gas produced in the gas generator <b>31</b> enters the turbine <b>14</b> via gas delivery conduit <b>36</b> and drives the turbine which, in turn, powers the shaft that drives the compressor <b>19</b>. Compressed air from the compressor <b>19</b> and high-pressure, fuel-rich gas from the gas generator <b>31</b> via the turbine <b>14</b> mix in the main combustor <b>32</b> and combust to generate thrust as combustion products accelerate during the expansion process to atmospheric pressure through the nozzle <b>16</b> (stations 4 to 5). The position of the gas generator <b>31</b> is shown above the turbine <b>14</b> and outside the turbine and main combustor <b>32</b> but the gas generator may be positioned in proximity to, and forward or aft exterior to, the turbine assembly <b>14</b> and main combustor <b>32</b>. It is also possible to position the gas generator <b>31</b> inside the main combustor <b>32</b>, although this location is not preferred.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ATR main combustor <b>32</b> operates differently from a turbojet afterburner <b>22</b>. One significant difference is that the pressure in the ATR main combustor <b>32</b> is higher than that of the turbojet afterburner <b>22</b>, as indicated by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>. The pressure in the ATR main combustor is higher because air enters the combustor immediately after passing through the compressor <b>19</b> and is not expanded across the turbine <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>B</figref> are rough pressure profiles of an operating afterburning turbojet <b>20</b> and an ATR <b>30</b>, respectively. The combustor pressure <b>13</b> between positions 2 and 3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is higher than the afterburner pressure <b>23</b> between positions 4 and 5 because air loses pressure as it drives the turbine <b>14</b> (positions 3 to 4). The main combustor pressure <b>33</b> between positions 2 and 4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is higher than the afterburner pressure <b>23</b> between positions 4 and 5 because incoming air from the compressor <b>19</b> bypasses the turbine <b>14</b>. The pressure profiles are intended to convey the principle behind the improved performance provided by the ATR and are not intended to convey precise relative pressures in the different segments of the engines.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An ATR main combustor <b>32</b> may operate at approximately twice the pressure of a turbojet afterburner. As a result, for the same air flowrate and compressor pressure ratio, the ATR generates approximately twice the thrust of an afterburning turbojet.

An Overjet comprises a gas generating means for producing an independent source of fuel-rich turbine drive gas, such as a gas generator <b>31</b> and a high-pressure mode afterburner, or a main combustor <b>32</b>. A high-pressure mode afterburner may be an afterburner of an afterburning turbojet <b>20</b> that serves as main combustor <b>32</b>.

Mode switching capability enables an operator to select engine thrust levels and propellant consumption to meet a wide spectrum of flight vehicle requirements. This mode transition can be configured to be continuous or abrupt, and multiple modes may be operated in parallel.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In non-afterburning turbojet mode, air compressed by compressor <b>19</b> is mixed with fuel and lean fuel combustion occurs in combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>with turbine <b>14</b> being driven by expansion of combustion products through the turbine. In this mode, fuel is supplied to combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>from a source similar to fuel supply <b>11</b> of a turbojet <b>10</b>. In afterburner mode, additional fuel is delivered to the afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> for combustion at normal afterburner pressure.

The air flowrate and compressor pressure ratio in ATR-mode are the same as, or similar to, turbojet and afterburner modes. Air enters the combustor <b>12</b><i>i</i>, which is inactive and, as a result, there is no temperature increase of the air when passing from positions 2 to 3. There is little to no drop in air pressure as air passes through the turbine <b>14</b> (positions 3 to 4) since no power is being extracted from this air flow. Instead, power to drive the compressor <b>19</b> comes from the gas generator <b>31</b>. A small pressure drop may occur as the air flows through the combustor <b>12</b> due to flow restrictions within this component. A hot, high-pressure fuel-rich gas from the gas generator <b>31</b> passes through the gas delivery conduit <b>36</b> to the turbine <b>14</b> which, in turn, provides shaft power to drive the compressor <b>19</b>. The fuel-rich turbine drive gas exits the turbine at position 4 and mixes and burns in the afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> with air from the compressor, resulting in a high-pressure, high-temperature mixture of air and combustion products at position 5. This mixture accelerates as it expands through the engine nozzle <b>16</b> to ambient pressure at position 6 to produce thrust.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a pressure profile graph comparing an Overjet pressure profile in ATR mode (solid line) with an afterburning turbojet pressure profile (dashed line).

The last two rows of Table 1 include performance values for an ATR of a similar size to the J85 and a rocket of the same thrust level as the Overjet in ATR mode. A liquid hydrocarbon-based fuel is assumed for each engine in the table.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Using thrust and propellant flowrate values for a General Electric J85-GE-21-based Overjet (Table 1), at least two differences in performance characteristics between afterburner mode and ATR-mode are apparent. Engine thrust in ATR mode is approximately 1.4 times higher than in afterburning mode. The higher thrust is due to the higher afterburner pressure in ATR mode at the same exit temperature and approximately the same total flowrate. Also, propellant flowrate in ATR mode is approximately 2.8 times higher than afterburner mode since all of the power to drive the compressor in ATR mode must be provided by the independent turbine drive gas.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Although engine thrust increases less than the propellant flowrate when switching the Overjet from afterburner to ATR mode, the specific impulse of an Overjet in ATR mode is still 1000 lbf&#xb7;sec/lbm, which is well in excess of the typical lsp of 350 lbf&#xb7;sec/lbm of a hydrocarbon-fueled rocket. In other words, the propellant flowrate of an Overjet in ATR mode using a hydrocarbon fuel is 35% that of a hydrocarbon-fueled rocket of the same thrust output.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">This relatively high specific impulse in ATR mode means that one application for which the Overjet is well-suited is to provide an aircraft with a short boost of high thrust, for example to reach the edge of space, without the added complexity and high fuel consumption of a separate rocket motor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">The ATR mode of an Overjet uses an external source of hot, high-pressure turbine drive gas as a substitute for the turbine drive gas produced by the turbojet combustor in turbojet or afterburner modes. Any of the external gas sources used in an ATR are suitable for use as an external source of turbine drive gas in an Overjet.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In ATR-mode, the hot, high-pressure, fuel-rich gas from the gas generator <b>31</b> is expanded through a turbine to generate the shaft power required to drive the compressor. Expansion can occur through either the turbine wheel <b>69</b> used for turbojet/afterburning mode or through a separate turbine dedicated for use in ATR mode (not shown). Activation of the gas generator <b>31</b> to produce hot, fuel rich gas is preferably controllable with the gas generator <b>31</b> being throttleable with respect to the flow rate of gas produced. The gas generator is preferably capable of being repeatably activated and inactivated during flight.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">An Overjet operating in ATR mode sets flowrate, pressure, temperature, and constituents of the gas from the gas generator <b>31</b> and the geometry of nozzle <b>16</b> such that the shaft power generated by expansion over the turbine <b>14</b> results in the delivery of air from the compressor <b>19</b> at the same flowrate and pressure ratio as in turbojet or afterburner mode. The flowrate, pressure, temperature, and constituents of the gas from the gas generator <b>31</b> are also set such that the fuel content, fuel flowrate, and air flowrate provide the heat release rate, temperature, and total flowrate needed to meet engine thrust and specific impulse requirements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">When transitioning from turbojet mode to ATR mode, the fuel supply <b>11</b> to the combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>is reduced and the gas generator <b>31</b> is activated to provide hot, fuel rich gas to drive the turbine <b>14</b> and to be combusted in the afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> with the fuel supply to the combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>ultimately stopping. Transitioning from ATR mode to turbojet mode operates in the reverse. It is also possible to activate the gas generator <b>31</b> while fuel is supplied to the combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>to produce additional thrust. When transitioning between afterburning turbojet mode to ATR mode, the fuel supply <b>11</b> to the combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>and afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> is reduced and the gas generator <b>31</b> is activated to provide hot, fuel rich gas to drive the turbine <b>14</b> and to be combusted in the afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> with the fuel supply to the combustor <b>12</b><i>i </i>and afterburner/main combustor <b>32</b> ultimately stopping.
