In order to reduce the weight of the items, blow-molded plastic is typically used. A blow-molded plastic structure has outer walls that enclose an interior hollow space. While the hollow interior enables the structures to be light-weight, the hollow interior of such blow-molded items may also reduce the strength of the item so that the item is unable to support a relatively large amount of weight or force.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0008">It is known that strengthening ribs made of metal or other durable material may be added to a blow-molded structure to increase the load-bearing strength of the structure. However, such strengthening ribs often significantly increase the weight of the structure and may create stress points in attachment locations that lead to mechanical failure of the structure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">Strengthening ribs may also be integrally formed from plastic during the blow-molding process in order to increase the load-bearing capability of the blow-molded structure. Such ribs may extend over portions of the length and width of the structure to provide load-bearing support for the structure. However, the integrally formed ribs typically require the use of thicker walls that add weight to the structure, increase production time, and increase the cost of producing such structures. The ribs may also interfere with other components of the structure, such as support legs for a table-top made of the blow-molded structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, there continues to be a need for blow-molded structures having improved load-bearing capability and a simple light-weight configuration.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0011">Accordingly, embodiments described herein provide a blow-molded plastic structure having a hollow interior portion formed during a blow-molding process. In a preferred embodiment, the blow-molded plastic structure includes a first outer portion, a second outer portion that is spaced apart from the first outer portion, and a pattern of structural stiffening features that are integrally formed in the first and second outer portions. A hollow interior portion is disposed between the first and second outer portions, wherein a distance between the first and second outer portions is defined by a first height. The pattern of structural stiffening features includes a plurality of first depressions and a plurality of second depressions. The first depressions extend from the first outer portion into the hollow interior portion, and are disposed in rows and columns. Each first depression includes a first floor spaced apart from the first outer portion. The first floor comprises a plurality of first arms, wherein one or more of the first arms are rotated with respect to an adjacent one of the first arms by a first angle. The second depressions extend from the second outer portion into the hollow interior portion, and are disposed in rows and columns. Each second depression includes a second floor spaced apart from the second outer portion. The second floor comprises a plurality of second arms, wherein one or more of the second arms are rotated with respect to an adjacent one of the second arms by a second angle.

The structure <b>10</b> includes a first outer portion <b>12</b>, and a second outer portion <b>14</b> that is generally spaced apart from the first outer portion <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the first outer portion <b>12</b> is generally planar. The first outer portion <b>12</b> and the second outer portion <b>14</b> enclose a hollow interior portion <b>16</b> formed during the blow-molding process. Specifically, the disclosure is directed to a pattern of structural stiffening features that include tripodal depressions <b>18</b> formed as part of the second outer portion <b>14</b> of the structure <b>10</b>, such as the pattern of tripodal depressions <b>18</b> within the dashed line box <b>20</b>. Each depression <b>18</b> extends toward the first outer portion <b>12</b> of the structure. The depressions <b>18</b> are arranged in rows <b>22</b> and columns <b>24</b> in the second outer portion <b>14</b> of the structure <b>10</b>, and this pattern may be repeated over a substantial portion of the second outer portion <b>14</b> of the structure.

Each depression <b>18</b> also includes an indentation adjacent to each side of the three sided island <b>26</b>, shown as indentations <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>and <b>28</b><i>c</i>.

In the first embodiment, the center-to-center spacing D<b>5</b> between the indentations <b>28</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>within each depression <b>18</b> ranges from about 11 mm to about 14 mm, and is preferably 12.5 mm.

In a preferred embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the material thickness of the second outer portion <b>14</b> may vary across the convex region <b>30</b>.

Because the edges of the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>have a large radius of curvature (R), the structure <b>10</b> can be more easily removed from the blow molding machine.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">Increased Strength. During the production, the quantity of plastic material (such as HDPE) provided to the mold must be adjusted to provide an optimum amount of material for the drawing of the depression structure in the mold. The curved structure of the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>described herein allows for higher quantities of the plasic material for the entire structure <b>10</b>, thereby helping to ensure that the areas of the structure around the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>will not be too soft when drawn in the mold. In this way, adequate strength can be more evenly maintained across the top and bottom surfaces of the structure <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">Reduced Defective Rate. Because of the large radius of curvature (R) of the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>, the depth to which material is drawn in the mold is not as deep as is typical of conventional blow-molded structures. Thus, the drawing area of the bottom surface of the structure <b>10</b> will not be too soft, thereby significantly reducing the rate of defects caused by low strength in the bottom surface.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">Better Performance. Because the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>are not as deep as depressions in conventional blow-molded structures, the bottom surface of the structure <b>10</b> can be thinner, which requires less material. Less material in the bottom surface allows for more material to be used in the top surface without an overall increase in material per unit. This allows for the top surface to be made thicker, and therefore stronger and more durable, which results in better physical performance, such as in impact tests and loading tests.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">Less Material Required for Production. Also because the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>are not as deep as depressions in conventional blow-molded structures, less material per unit is needed for production of the structure <b>10</b>, while maintaining at least the same strength as conventional structures.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">Reduced Production Time. Because of the depression structure, the wall thickness over the entire structure <b>10</b> can be more even than is possible with conventional blow-molded structures. This allows production workers to be able to adjust and fine-tune the operation of the blow-mold machine for the structure <b>10</b> faster and more efficiently than was possible with conventional structures. This reduces the idle time for the machine.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">Support of Three-Indentation Depressions. Because the depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>having three arms <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>28</b><i>c</i>, can be more evenly distributed across the bottom surface of the structure <b>10</b>, the material drawing rate in the mold can be reduced. Although a four-arm depression embodiment may provide greater strength overall, four-arm depressions require a higher drawing rate, which requires more material per unit for production. Thus, from a material standpoint, the three-arm depressions <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the preferred embodiment provide an advantage over a four-arm design.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
