The recipient usually clicks out of the shared link and visits the corresponding webpage. It is then up to the recipient to identify what, if any, portions of the web page are relevant. Also, when a URL is shared on most communication platforms, a preview of the web page is generated for the recipients. This preview is generally related to the primary purpose or topic of the web site.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, in some cases, the entire webpage might not be of interest to the recipient or relevant to the context of an ongoing discussion where the URL was shared. For example, an employee can share a web page link consisting of numerous paragraphs, but only a few of them are relevant to the intended recipient or an ongoing discussion with the recipient. Recipients currently either have to manually scroll through the page to find areas of interest or resort to techniques like using the browsers search feature to look for keywords. The recipient often must read through large amounts of content before finding the relevant portion. This wastes time for the recipient and causes frustration, which often causes the recipient to give up or not even attempt to find the relevant content. This can be particularly true where the preview of the web site presented to the recipient has nothing to do with the context of the conversation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result, a need exists for creating custom web link previews making it easier for recipients of shared URLs to identify relevant content on the corresponding web page.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples described herein include systems and methods for providing smart web links that make it easier for users to identify relevant content. In an example, users can share messages on a communication channel, such as email, instant messaging, social media posting, and the like. One user can share a URL for a web page on the communication channel. An agent on a user device that receives the shared URL can detect the URL in the communication channel. The agent can send the URL and the shared messages to a server.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The server can use the URL to retrieve its corresponding web page. Upon receiving the web page, the server can identify sections of the web page. For example, where the web page is received as a Hypertext Markup Language (&#x201c;HTML&#x201d;) file, the server can identify HTML elements tags in the file that indicate a section. When the web page is actually multiple pages, the different sections can correspond to smaller portions, such as a few paragraphs, of the overall webpage. The server can process content from the web page sections and the shared messages to prepare them for a comparison. For example, the server can clean the content by making all text lower case, tokenizing, removing stop words like &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;is,&#x201d; &#x201c;at,&#x201d; &#x201c;which,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on,&#x201d; removing punctuation, and lemmatizing. The server can then implement natural language processing (&#x201c;NLP&#x201d;) techniques on the cleaned data, such as a word-embedding algorithm. The word-embedding algorithm can encode the meanings of words in the content as real-valued vectors in a vector space where words similar in meaning are closer to each other in the vector space.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The server can compare the processed content from the web page sections to the shared messages to determine which section is the most semantically similar to the shared messages. In an example, the server can identify the most semantically similar section by calculating a matching score for each section. For example, a section's matching score can be calculated based on the amount of word embedding matches or based on the closeness of the words in the vector space. The section with the highest score can be determined to the most relevant section to the URL recipient based on the context of the conversation in the shared messages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an example, the server can modify the file of the web page to make the relevant content easier for the recipient user to identify. In one example, the server can generate a custom preview of the web page based on the highest scoring section. For example, the server can insert Open Graph (&#x201c;OG&#x201d;) meta tags into the web page file that point to the highest scoring section. The OG meta tags can be used to create the web site preview. This lets the recipient user see a preview of relevant content on the web page instead of the web page generally.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, the server can highlight relevant content in the web page, such as by highlighting text, changing the background color, and changing the text color so that the text is clearly visible to the user when the web page loads. The server can do this by inserting CSS properties into the web page file. In an example, the server can highlight all content in the web page file that exceed a matching threshold. This can allow the recipient user to easily identify relevant content on the web page across all the sections.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one example, the server can append the URL with a named anchor so that the web page automatically scrolls to the highest scoring section when the web page loads. This can save the recipient user time and frustration in locating the most relevant portion of the web page.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an example, the server can save a copy of the modified web page file in a storage location like a web server. The server can send a modified URL to the recipient's user device that points to the modified web page. The agent on the user device can replace the shared URL with the modified URL. This can cause the communication platform to show the custom preview of the web page created by the server. If the recipient user selects or clicks on the preview or the modified URL, the user device can retrieve the modified web page instead of the original web page. The user device can load the modified web page with all the modifications made by the server. In one example, the user device can make a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (&#x201c;HTTP&#x201d;) request to retrieve the modified web page from a web server where it is hosted. In one example, the server can send the modified web page to the user device where it can be stored in a local cache. When the user selects the link, the user device can load the modified web page from the local cache instead of making an HTTP request.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The examples summarized above can each be incorporated into a non-transitory, computer-readable medium having instructions that, when executed by a processor associated with a computing device, cause the processor to perform the stages described. Additionally, the example methods summarized above can each be implemented in a system including, for example, a memory storage and a computing device having a processor that executes instructions to carry out the stages described.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the examples, as claimed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a system for providing smart web links.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example method for providing smart web links.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sequence diagram of an example method for providing smart web links.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an illustration of an example graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;) of a modified web page using smart web links.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an illustration of an example web page preview of a modified web page using smart web links.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made in detail to the present examples, including examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Two user devices, a user device A <b>110</b> and a user device B <b>120</b>, can include a communication channel <b>114</b>. The user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can be one or more processor-based devices, such as a personal computer, tablet, or cell phone. The communication channel <b>114</b> can be a dedicated space on a communication software platform for communication between users. For example, the communication channel <b>114</b> can be an email chain, instant message conversation, short message service (&#x201c;SMS&#x201d;) message conversation, an online forum, comments on a work ticket, and so on. Accordingly, the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can have one or many communication channels <b>114</b> simultaneously. The communication channel <b>114</b> can operate through a communication service <b>132</b> on a communication server <b>130</b>. The communication service <b>132</b> can facilitate communication of users of the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> by relaying messages between the two. For example, the communication channel <b>114</b> can be an email chain and the communication server <b>130</b> can be an email exchange server.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an example, the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can include a management agent <b>112</b>. The management agent <b>112</b> can be responsible for executing certain management functions on user devices. For example, the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can be enrolled in a Unified Endpoint Management (&#x201c;UEM&#x201d;) system. A management server <b>140</b> of the UEM system can enforce security and compliance protocols on the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> through the management agent <b>112</b>. The management server <b>140</b> can be a single server or a group of servers, including multiple servers implemented virtually across multiple computing platforms. The management agent <b>112</b> can communicate with a management service <b>142</b> to provide this functionality.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the management agent <b>112</b> can monitor messages on the communication channel <b>114</b> to identify any URLs sent or received. In one example, access to content in the communication platform can be provided by an operating system of the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>. In another example, the communication channel <b>114</b> can be an application integrated with the UEM system. The management agent <b>112</b> can monitor communications on one or multiple communication platforms <b>114</b> on the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the user of user device A <b>110</b> sends a message to the user of user device B <b>120</b> that contains a URL, the management agent <b>112</b> can extract the URL from the message and sent it to the management service <b>142</b>. In one example, the user device A <b>110</b>, the user device B <b>120</b>, or both can send data about communications between users of the two or more devices to the management service <b>142</b>. Examples of such data can include emails, messages, posts, and others. For example, the URL can be sent in an email chain, and the management agent <b>112</b> can send the URL and content and metadata of the emails to the management service <b>142</b>. Metadata can include information about which device sent each message, when each message was sent, and so on.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The management service <b>142</b> can make a hypertext transfer protocol (&#x201c;HTTP&#x201d;) call using the URL to retrieve a web page data file (&#x201c;data file&#x201d;) <b>152</b> from a web server <b>150</b>. The web server <b>150</b> can be a server that hosts the URL and provides data files for web pages upon request. The data file can be for a web page, such as a Hypertext Markup Language (&#x201c;HTML&#x201d;) file. Although the data file <b>152</b> is described as a HTML file throughout, these references are merely used as examples and are not intended to be limiting in any way. For example, the data file <b>152</b> can encompass any data file type used for display purposes, such as an Extensible Markup Language (&#x201c;XML&#x201d;) file or JavaScript Object Notation (&#x201c;JSON&#x201d;) file.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The management service <b>142</b> can be responsible for comparing the data file <b>152</b> and the communication content to determine the most relevant portion of the web page for the users. For example, the management service <b>142</b> can score each section of the web page based on how closely related the web page section content is to the content of the communications. The management service <b>142</b> can use various techniques to compare the contents, such as word-embedding, many-to-one (&#x201c;N:1&#x201d;) matching, keyword extraction, named-entity recognition, natural language processing, and so on.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The management service <b>142</b> can create a custom version of the web page that directs a user who clicks on the link to the most relevant section. This can be done by creating a modified web page data file (&#x201c;modified data file&#x201d;) <b>162</b> from the data file <b>152</b>. For example, the management service <b>142</b> can add highlights to the highest scoring section, add a named anchor or URL fragment to cause the web page to automatically display the highest scoring section, and create a custom preview that displays content from the highest scoring section.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an example, the management service <b>142</b> can save the modified data file to a database <b>160</b>. The database <b>160</b> can be part of the management server <b>140</b> or its own device, such as a database server. In one example, the database <b>160</b> can be a web server that stores web page data files created by the management service <b>142</b>. For example, the management service <b>142</b> can send the modified data file <b>162</b> to the database <b>160</b>. The management service <b>142</b> can then send instructions to the management agent <b>112</b> on the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> to modify the URL on the communication channel <b>114</b>. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can change the URL so that it directs to the database <b>160</b> instead of the web server <b>150</b>. Changing the URL can cause the communication channel <b>114</b> to generate a preview for the modified data file <b>162</b> instead of the data file <b>152</b>, which can be a preview that displays content from the highest scoring section.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When a user selects the URL inserted by the management agent <b>112</b>, the user device A <b>110</b> or B <b>120</b> can make an HTTP request to the database <b>160</b>, and the database <b>160</b> can respond with the modified data file <b>162</b>. The user device A <b>110</b> or B <b>120</b> can then display the web page in a web browser <b>116</b>. The web browser <b>116</b> can automatically scroll the web page to the highest scoring section and highlight its content according to the modifications in the data file <b>162</b>. Where multiple sections have a high enough matching score (e.g., exceeding a threshold), the web browser <b>116</b> can highlight those sections as well so that the user can easily identify them when scrolling through the web page.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although a server example is described throughout, some functions described as being performed by a server can be performed at the management agent <b>112</b>. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can be configured to retrieve the data file <b>152</b>, analyze the communication content and the web page content, identify a highest scoring section, modify the data file <b>152</b>, and store a modified copy <b>162</b> in a local cache of the user device A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>. The management agent <b>112</b> can also modify the URL in the communication channel <b>114</b> so that it directs to the cached modified data file <b>162</b>. When a user selects the link, the modified data file <b>162</b> can be retrieved from the cache.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an example method for providing smart web links. At stage <b>110</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can detect a URL for a web page in a communication channel. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can monitor messages exchanged on the communication channel <b>114</b> of the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can monitor emails, instant messages, short message service (&#x201c;SMS&#x201d;) messages, and online posts. When the management agent <b>112</b> detects a URL on the communication channel <b>114</b>, the management agent <b>112</b> can copy the URL and send it to the management server <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an example, the management agent <b>112</b> can also send content from the communication channel <b>114</b> to the management server <b>140</b>. For example, when the URL is sent in an email, the management agent <b>112</b> can send content from the body of the email and any other emails in the email chain. As an example, users of the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can exchange messages, such as emails or instant messages. The user of device A <b>110</b> can send a message with a URL to the user of device B <b>120</b>. The management agent <b>112</b> can collect the URL and the messages exchanged in the conversation and send them to the management server <b>140</b>. Alternatively, an email gateway or some other messaging server used to deliver the messages can send the message content to the management server <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At stage <b>120</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can retrieve a data file of the web page using the URL. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can make an HTTP request using the URL. The request can be directed to the web server <b>150</b>, which hosts the web page of the URL. The web server <b>150</b> can respond with the data file <b>152</b> of the web page. The data file can be an HTML, file, for example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At stage <b>130</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can identify sections of the web page in the data file <b>152</b>. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can identify predefined sections in the data file <b>152</b> by locating HTML elements, such as &#x3c;h&#x3e;, &#x3c;p&#x3e;, &#x3c;section&#x3e;, and &#x3c;div&#x3e; tags. The sections can also be divided according to total amount of text, where a threshold number of sentences or words causes the next sentence or paragraph to start a new section. In one example, the management server <b>140</b> can filter out sections that are unlikely to include content relevant to the exchanged messaged. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can filter out headers and footers. In another example, sections can be filtered out where the number of characters in the section is below a threshold. In one example, filter settings can be defined beforehand by an administrative user.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At stage <b>140</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can compare content on the communication channel with content in each of the web page sections. This can include processing both sets of content using one or more methods. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can pre-process the data by cleaning it. Cleaning data includes processes like making all text lower case, tokenization, removing stop words like &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;is,&#x201d; &#x201c;at,&#x201d; &#x201c;which,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on,&#x201d; removing punctuation, and lemmatization.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an example, after the cleaning the data, the management server <b>140</b> can process the data using NLP techniques. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can implement word embedding where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. The real-valued vector can encode the meaning of the word so that other words that are closer in the vector space should have similar meanings. Some examples of word embedding algorithms include Word2vec, Glove, TF-IDF, and Doc2Vec. In the data file <b>152</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can treat the entire web page as a single document or file when applying NLP techniques. Alternatively, the management server <b>140</b> apply NLP techniques to each section in isolation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an example, the management server <b>140</b> can compare the processed data from the communications and the data file <b>152</b>. In one example, this this can be a semantic comparison. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can match embeddings taken from the various sections of the web page against the embeddings of the communication content. This can be done using many-to-one (N:1) matching, as an example. For example, each section of the web page can have its own set of embeddings, but the communication content can have just one set. The communication embeddings can match to embeddings in any of the web page sections, but the web page sections can only match to the one set in the communication content.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, other processing techniques can be used to process the data as well, such as keyword extraction and Named Entity Recognition (&#x201c;NER&#x201d;). The management server <b>140</b> can also implement other comparison techniques determine a high-level match, such as a sentiment analysis or categorizing sections based on topics.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At stage <b>150</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can determine a matching score for each web page section based on the comparison. In an example, the matching score for each section can be the number of embedding matches it has with the communication content. The highest score can indicate the web page section that is semantically closest to the communication content.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example, the management server <b>140</b> can assign weights to sections of the web page. These weights can be used in determining matching scores. For example, for each section the management server <b>140</b> can multiply its weight by the number of embedding matches to get the matching score. Weights can be determined based on various factors, such as HTML element tags and total number of characters.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At stage <b>160</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can modify the data file <b>152</b>. In one example, this can include highlighting content in the highest scoring section. In an example, highlighting content in the highest scoring section can include highlighting text, changing the background color, and changing the text color so that the text is clearly visible to the user when the web page loads. In one example, this can be done by inserting CSS properties into the data file <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example, the management server <b>140</b> can highlight content in one or multiple sections. For example, when two or more sections have the same highest matching score, both can be highlighted. In another example, sections with a score within a threshold amount of the actual highest score can be highlighted. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can highlight content in sections with a matching score within 5% of the highest scoring section score. This can be especially helpful in instances when several non-continuous sections in the original webpage match the content from the communication channel <b>114</b>. The user can easily identify all sections of the web page with relevant content by scrolling through the page and finding highlighted sections.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example, modifying the data file <b>152</b> can include generating a custom preview of the web page. For example, many communication platforms generate and display a preview of a web page when a URL is shared. The host of the web site can control what displays in a web site preview using Open Graph (&#x201c;OG&#x201d;) meta tags. In an HTML file, OG meta tags include an &#x201c;og:&#x201d; before the property name. The following is an example HTML script that can be inserted into the data file <b>152</b> to create a custom preview of the highest scoring section:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0000">&#x3c;meta property=&#x201c;og:title&#x201d; content=&#x201c;[section title]&#x201d;/&#x3e;<br/>&#x3c;meta property=&#x201c;og:description&#x201d; content=&#x201c;[section description]&#x201d;/&#x3e;<br/>&#x3c;meta property=&#x201c;og:image content=&#x201c;[section image file name]&#x201d;/&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In the example above, the management server <b>140</b> can insert a section heading or title of the highest scoring section in the &#x201c;[section title]&#x201d; location. The management server <b>140</b> can identify the section heading using a section heading HTML element tag, such as a &#x3c;s&#x3e; or &#x3c;section&#x3e; tag, and copy the text from the tag into the &#x201c;[section title]&#x201d;. The management server <b>140</b> can insert content in the &#x201c;[section description]&#x201d; location in a similar manner. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can locate a paragraph tag, such as &#x3c;p&#x3e; tag inside of the section tag, and insert a portion of the text according to the number of characters allowed for the preview. In an example where the section includes a description in the web page, the management server <b>140</b> can simply copy that over. Where the web page includes an image in the highest scoring section, the management server <b>140</b> can copy the file name to the &#x201c;[section image file name]&#x201d; location.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In an example, the modifying the data file <b>152</b> can include configuring the web page to automatically scroll (&#x201c;autoscroll&#x201d;) to the highest scoring section when the web page is loaded. The management server <b>140</b> can do this using a named anchor (also called a URL fragment), for example. This can be done by adding hash (#) character followed by an identifier of the highest scoring section. For example, the URL http://www.webpage.com/subpage#identifier would load the website webpage.com/subpage and automatically scroll to a portion of the web page with an element &#x201c;id=identifier.&#x201d; The management server <b>140</b> can append to the URL a named anchor with the text of the &#x201c;id&#x201d; element of the highest scoring section. In an instance where an &#x201c;id&#x201d; element does not exist in the HTML of the highest scoring section, the management server <b>140</b> can create and insert one.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">In an example, after modifying the data file <b>152</b> (which becomes the modified file <b>162</b>), the management server <b>140</b> can save the modified data file <b>162</b> to the database <b>160</b>. At stage <b>170</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can modify the URL in the communication channel <b>114</b> to direct to the modified data file <b>162</b>. In an example, the management server <b>140</b> can insert a domain into the URL that directs it to database <b>160</b>. As an example, the database <b>160</b> can be, or connected to, a web server, such as a cloud-based web server, that hosts the web page for the modified data file <b>162</b>. The domain for the database <b>160</b> can be newdomain.com. Using the URL example above as the URL of the original data file <b>152</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can modify the URL to http://www.newdomain.webpage.com/subpage#identifier. Using this method, modified data files <b>162</b> can be hosted at the database <b>160</b> with their original URL modified to include the domain of the database <b>160</b> and a named anchor. This method is merely an example, and other methods can be used to redirect the URL to the modified data file <b>162</b>. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can cache a copy of the web page at the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>, and selecting the URL can pull the modified data file <b>162</b> from the cache.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sequence diagram of an example method for providing smart web links. At stage <b>302</b>, the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can exchange messages. For example, user of each of the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b> can exchange chat messages or emails, or write comments in a work ticket or web forum. Although two user devices are described, this can include more users and devices. For example, the messages can be exchanged through a gateway or messaging server. At stage <b>304</b>, the user on user device A <b>110</b> can send a URL to the user device B <b>120</b> on the communication channel <b>114</b>. For example, the user can send a message or email with the URL, or post the URL in a ticket or web forum.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">At stage <b>306</b>, the user device B <b>120</b> can send the URL to the management server <b>140</b>. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> on the user device B <b>120</b> can detect the URL, copy it, and send it to the management server <b>120</b>. In one example, the management agent <b>112</b> can detect the URL by monitoring the communication channel <b>114</b> and detecting anything sent in the format of a URL. The detection and stage <b>306</b> can alternatively be done by the gateway or messaging server.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">At stage <b>308</b>, the user device B <b>120</b> can send communication content related to the exchanged messages to the management server <b>140</b>. The communication content can include messages exchanged or shared on the communication channel <b>114</b> leading up to the URL being sent. In an example where the URL is sent in an email, the management agent <b>112</b> can collect and send any emails in the same email chain that were exchanged before the URL was sent and any content from the email that included the URL. In an example where the URL is sent in a group or private chat, the management agent <b>112</b> can collect and send messages exchanged in the chat before the URL was shared. In one example, the management agent <b>112</b> can be configured to retrieve messages with a specified amount of time or a specified amount of the most recent messages sent before the URL was sent. For example, the management agent <b>112</b> can collect the most recent ten messages or messages collected that were sent on the same day, within an hour, or within ten minutes of the URL being sent. These settings can be set by an administrator, in an example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">At stage <b>310</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can make an HTTP request using the URL to retrieve the web page associated with the URL. The HTTP request can arrive at the web server <b>150</b> that hosts the web page. At stage <b>312</b>, the web server <b>150</b> can send the data file <b>152</b> for the web page to the management server <b>140</b>. In an example, the data file <b>152</b> can be an HTML file.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">At stage <b>314</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can identify sections of the web page in the data file <b>152</b>. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can identify predefined sections in the data file <b>152</b> by locating HTML element tags, such as &#x3c;h&#x3e;, &#x3c;p&#x3e;, &#x3c;section&#x3e;, and &#x3c;div&#x3e; tags. In one example, the management server <b>140</b> can filter out sections that are unlikely to include content relevant to the exchanged messaged such as headers, footers, and sections can with few characters than a threshold amount.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">At stage <b>316</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can compare the web page sections to the communication content. In an example, the comparison can include multiple processing stages. For example, a first process can be a pre-processing stage that includes cleaning the data. This can include processes like making all text lower case, tokenization, removing stop words like &#x201c;the,&#x201d; &#x201c;is,&#x201d; &#x201c;at,&#x201d; &#x201c;which,&#x201d; and &#x201c;on,&#x201d; removing punctuation, and lemmatization.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">A second process can include using NLP techniques to characterize the content. On such technique can be word-embedding, which is where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. The real-valued vector can encode the meaning of the word so that other words that are closer in the vector space should have similar meanings. Some examples of word embedding algorithms include Word2vec, Glove, TF-IDF, and Doc2Vec. Other methods can be optionally included in processing the data. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can also perform a keyword extraction or NER.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In an example, the data comparison can be a semantic comparison that attempts to match meanings of the web page sections to the exchanged messages. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can match embeddings taken from the various sections of the web page against the embeddings of the communication content. This can be done using many-to-one (N:1) matching, as an example. For example, each section of the web page can have its own set of embeddings, but the communication content can have just one set. The communication embeddings can match to embeddings in any of the web page sections, but the web page sections can only match to the one set in the communication content.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">At stage <b>318</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can determine matching scores for the web page sections. In an example, the matching score for each section can be the number of embedding matches it has with the communication content. The highest score can indicate the web page section that is semantically closest to the communication content.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In one example, the management server <b>140</b> can assign weights to the web page sections. The management server <b>140</b> can multiple the number of matched embeddings with the weight to get a matching score for a section. Weights can be determined based on various factors, such as HTML, element tags and total number of characters. In one example, the management server <b>140</b> can process the data using multiple methods, and each method can be assigned a weight. For example, the management server <b>140</b> calculate one score based on a semantic similarity analysis and another based on a keyword match. The semantic similarity score can be given a greater weight than the keyword match score or vice versa. The matching score for each section can then be the aggregate of the weighted scores.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">At stage <b>320</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can modify the data file <b>152</b> to highlight content in the highest scoring section. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can insert CSS properties into the data file <b>152</b> that highlights text, changes the background color, or changes the text color of the highest scoring section so that the text is clearly visible to the user when the web page is displayed. The management server <b>140</b> can highlight one or multiple sections. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can highlight content in all sections that fall above a threshold, such as within 10% or within five matching score points of the highest scoring section. This can help prevent content relevant to the communication between the users from being excluded.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">At stage <b>322</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can generate a custom preview for the URL based on the highest scoring section. For example, the management server <b>140</b> can insert OG meta tags based on the highest scoring section. The OG meta tags can identify a title of the highest scoring section, provide a description or some text from the highest scoring section, and include an image file (if any) from the highest scoring section. If the communication channel <b>114</b> has the capability of providing web site previews from posted URLs, the communication channel can identify the OG meta tags and present the custom preview accordingly.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">At stage <b>324</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can configure the web page to automatically scroll to the highest scoring section when the web page is retrieved. In one example, this can be done using a named anchor. For example, the management server can append the URL with a hash symbol (#) followed by an &#x201c;id&#x201d; element associated with the highest scoring section. If the highest scoring section does not yet have an &#x201c;id&#x201d; element, the management server <b>140</b> can create for the section and insert it into the data file <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">At stage <b>326</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can send the modified data file <b>162</b> of the web page to the database <b>160</b>. In an example, the database <b>160</b> can store the modified data file <b>162</b> for a specified amount of time. For example, the content for the web page may only be relevant to a specific conversation between the users, and saving the modified data file <b>162</b> indefinitely can waste valuable storage space. The database <b>160</b> can be configured to delete the modified data file <b>162</b> after a specified amount of time, such as a day, a week, or a month. In one example, the database <b>160</b> can dedicate a specified amount of storage space to modified web page data files <b>162</b> and do a rolling time-based removal. For example, if storing a new modified data file <b>162</b> would cause the used storage space to exceed its allotted amount, the database <b>160</b> can be configured to delete the oldest modified data files <b>162</b> until enough space is available.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">At stage <b>328</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can send a new URL for the modified web page to the user device B <b>120</b>. At stage <b>330</b>, the management server <b>140</b> can also send the new URL to the user device A <b>110</b>. The new URL can be directed to the modified data file <b>162</b> on the database <b>160</b>. In one example, the format of the new URL can be the same as the original URL, but the management server <b>140</b> can insert a domain into the original URL that causes it to direct to the modified data file <b>162</b>. As an example, if the original URL is http://www.webpage.com and the domain for the modified data file <b>162</b> is newdomain.com, the original URL can be modified to http://www.newdomain.webpage.com.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">In an example, the management server <b>120</b> can send the new URL to the management agent <b>112</b> on the user devices A <b>110</b>, B <b>120</b>. The management agent <b>112</b> can then insert the new URL into the communication channel <b>114</b>. In an example, this can include replacing the original URL with the new URL. At stages <b>332</b> and <b>334</b>, the user devices A <b>110</b> and B <b>120</b> can display the custom preview on the communication channel <b>114</b>. In one example, the communication platform <b>114</b> can retrieve the modified data file <b>162</b> from the database <b>160</b> and detect the OG meta tags. The communication channel <b>114</b> can then create the custom preview based on the OG meta tags. In one example, the communication channel <b>114</b> can request data for the preview only, and the database <b>160</b> can use the OG meta tags to identify the data for the custom preview and send it to the communication channel <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">At stage <b>336</b>, the user of user device B <b>120</b> can select the new URL. For example, the user can click or select the URL or the custom preview generated in the communication channel <b>114</b>. In response, the user device B <b>120</b> can make an HTTP request for the modified web page data file <b>162</b> using the new URL, at stage <b>338</b>. In an example where the modified data file <b>162</b> is already retrieved at stage <b>334</b>, the user device B <b>120</b> can retrieve it from a storage component of the user device B <b>120</b>, such as a local cache. At stage <b>340</b>, the database can send the modified data file <b>352</b> to the user device B <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">At stage <b>342</b>, the user device B <b>120</b> can display the modified web page. This can be done in the web browser <b>116</b>, for example. The web browser <b>116</b> can load the web page and apply the highlights inserted at stage <b>320</b>. The web browser <b>116</b> can also detect the named anchor and automatically scroll to the highest scoring section. The user will therefore be shown the most relevant portion of the web page after selecting the URL based on the conversation leading up to the URL being shared.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an illustration of an example graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;) <b>400</b> of a modified web page using smart web links.
