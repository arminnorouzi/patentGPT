nonprovisional patent application claiming priority to the provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 63/217,018 filed on Jun. 30, 2021. The entire content of the above-referenced application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tumor Treating Fields are low-intensity (e.g., 1-3 V/cm) alternating electric fields within the intermediate frequency range (100-500 kHz) targeting solid tumors by disrupting mitosis. This non-invasive treatment targets solid tumors and is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,016,725; 7,089,054; 7,333,852; 7,565,205; 8,244,345; 8,715,203; 8,764,675; 10,188,851; and 10,441,776, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tumor Treating Fields are typically delivered through two pairs of transducer arrays that generate perpendicular fields within the treated tumor. The transducer arrays that make up each of these pairs are positioned on opposite sides of the body part that is being treated. For example, in using the OPTUNE&#xae; system (manufactured by Novocure Limited, having a principal place of business in St. Helier, Jersey), at least one pair of electrodes of the transducer array is located to the left and right (LR) of the tumor, and at least one pair of electrodes is located anterior and posterior (AP) to the tumor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each transducer array used for the delivery of Tumor Treating Fields in the OPTUNE&#xae; system comprises at least one set of non-conductive ceramic disk electrodes coupled to the patient's skin. For example, the OPTUNE&#xae; system may position the transducer arrays on a patient's shaved head (e.g., treatment of Glioblastoma, hereinafter &#x2018;GBM&#x2019;) with the non-conductive ceramic disk electrodes coupled to the patient's skin through a layer of conductive medical gel.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To form the ceramic disk electrodes, a conductive layer is formed on a top surface of nonconductive ceramic material. A bottom surface of the nonconductive ceramic material is coupled to the conductive medical gel. The nonconductive ceramic material is a safety feature to ensure that direct-current signals are blocked from unintentionally being transmitted to the patient. The medical gel may deform to match the body's contours and provide electrical contact between the arrays and the skin; as such, the medical gel interface bridges the skin and reduces interference. The device is intended to be continuously worn by the patient for two to four days before removal for hygienic care and re-shaving (if necessary), followed by reapplication with a new set of arrays. As such, the medical gel remains in substantially continuous contact with an area of the patient's skin for a period of 2-4 days at a time. It is to such assemblies and methods of producing and using the same, that the present disclosure is directed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exemplary embodiment of a schematic diagram of electrodes applied to living tissue.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exemplary embodiment of an electronic device configured to generate a Tumor Treating Field.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an exploded view of one embodiment of a transducer array that has a first layout of electrode elements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a plan view of a flex circuit used in the transducer array illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a plan view of electrode elements used in the transducer array illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a plan view of stiffeners used in the transducer array illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> is a plan view of conductive hydrogel discs used in the transducer array illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref> is a plan view of hydrogel barriers used in the transducer array illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref> is a view of the hydrogel discs and the hydrogel barriers as &#x201c;seen&#x201d;

Regulations limit the amount of current that can be driven through an electrode assembly to an amount that keeps the measured temperature at locations on the subject's body below a temperature threshold. As practiced in the art, the temperature at the location of the electrode assemblies on the subject's body is controlled to be below the temperature threshold by reducing the operational current driven by the electrode assemblies and reducing the strength of the resulting TTFields. This in turn becomes an over-riding limitation on the TTFields strength that can be used to treat the tumor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">On electrode assemblies that comprise multiple electrode elements, the portions of the electrode assemblies positioned directly beneath the electrode elements get hotter than the portions of the electrode assemblies positioned between the electrode elements. Furthermore, on electrode assemblies that comprise multiple electrode elements, higher currents flow through the electrode elements located along the edge of the array compared to the electrode elements located toward the middle of the array. Further still, an electrode element located at a corner or similar sharp bend in the edge of the array will have a higher current than other electrode elements along the edge and near the center of the array. The tendency of an electrode assembly to drive higher currents through electrode elements located along the periphery of the array can lead to higher temperature zones (or &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d;) e.g., at the corners or edges of the electrode assembly. These hot spots are the locations that reach the threshold temperature first and therefore control the requirement to reduce the current. As such, the generation of hot spots limits the maximum operational current that may be driven by an electrode assembly, and the strength of the resulting TTFields.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This application describes a variety of approaches for reducing or minimizing the uneven distribution of current in electrode assemblies, which ultimately permits the use of higher operating currents without exceeding the threshold temperature. Electrode assemblies operated with increased current can induce stronger TTFields in the subject's body, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. The electrode assemblies disclosed herein allow current and heat to be spread more evenly over the array thereby minimizing or eliminating hot spots.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One approach for reducing or minimizing hotspots on electrode arrays relies on the incorporation into the array of variable resistivity conductive gel elements to passively balance the electrical current between the various electrode elements and thereby carry heat away from the hot spots, as described below. This lowers the temperature of the hot spots and raises the temperature of the cooler regions when a given AC voltage is applied to the electrode assembly (as compared to the prior art configuration described above). Accordingly, the current can be increased (thereby increasing the therapeutic effect) without exceeding the safety temperature threshold at any point on the subject's skin.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the inventive concept(s) in detail by way of exemplary language and results, it is to be understood that the inventive concept(s) is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description.
