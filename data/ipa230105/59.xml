However, these efficiencies in manufacturing are not necessarily correlated with efficiencies in the honeybee's internal hive conditions. The wood in conventional hives does not provide sufficient thermal insulation for the hives. That is, the wood does not prevent heat gains or losses due to environmental factors (e.g., external temperature, sun exposure, etc.) and creates excessive temperature fluctuations. Condensation can occur on the lids and walls of a conventional wooden hive when the external temperature is below the internal dew point of the hive. Condensed water can drip onto the bees, causing death in cold conditions. Moreover, prolonged moisture on walls can result in moldy hive conditions and spoiled honey stores, leading to mold and fungal growth within the hive which contributes to other diseases such as chalkbrood and <i>Nosema </i>(e.g., <i>Nosema apis </i>and/or <i>Nosema ceranae</i>). Weaker colonies cannot survive these conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many hives utilize ventilated lids or covers to address the condensation issues with wooden hives. The ventilated lids allow warm humid air from inside the hive to escape before it can condense. Thus, use of ventilated lids may lower the air temperature and reduce the humidity in the hive. This lowering of air temperature and reduction in humidity represents a significant loss of energy. When the energy is lost to the atmosphere, the bees must gather and consume additional food and water to replace the energy (e.g., to maintain necessary temperature and humidity). In particular, the honeybees generate heat with their bodies by shivering, cooling by fanning with their wings, and humidity by working water droplets. The process of regulating hive temperature and humidity using heat, air flow, and water vapor generated by the bees is an energy-intensive process.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Still further, pests such as hive beetles may invade colonies that reside in conventional wooden hives. Many beekeepers locate hives in full sun because higher temperatures and drier soil conditions are unfavorable for these pests. Moving energy inefficient wooden hives into full sun has created a need for more ventilation in the hives. Accordingly, beekeepers have introduced screened bottom boards, which allows for additional ventilation. However, the ventilated bottom boards create a large attack vector through the hive bottom in addition to the large hive entrances and ventilated covers. The openings used for ventilation are often exploited by pests to gain access. These openings also compromise the integrity of the hive's microclimate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Honeybees become stressed, because of their weakened physical defenses against pests, the large fluctuations in temperature created by the conventional hives (e.g., solar heat gain during the day and heat loss at night), and the inability to maintain stable humidity levels due to the large amount of ventilation. This stress makes the colony less productive, more defensive, and more easily susceptible to diseases.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This brief overview is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This brief overview is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this brief overview intended to be used to limit the claimed subject matter's scope.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An insulated hive helps to create conditions that favor the honeybee and its natural habitat. In particular, the insulating capabilities of the hive can be adjusted to reduce the effects of the ambient external environment (e.g., external temperature, external humidity, exposure to sun, etc.) on the internal conditions of the hive. By enclosing or substantially enclosing the hive within a thermally insulated structure, presence of condensation on internal surfaces of the hive are significantly reduced, particularly in colder conditions. Further, an insulated hive helps slow the movement of energy in the form of heat through the walls which helps stabilize the internal conditions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, a sump area may be added at the bottom of the hive to encourage water vapor condensation in a single location. Accordingly, the sump may leave water at the bottom of the hive where honeybees can gather it for reuse while retaining energy expended by the bees to warm and humidify the air. Moreover, the sump may help to prevent water from condensing in other undesirable areas of the hive. Thus, the sump helps to lower the possibility of moisture related issues that negatively impact colony health during winter.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Removing upper ventilation can help the bees retain the energy expended conditioning the microclimate of the hive. In particular, removing the upper ventilation reduces or eliminates loss of heat and/or humidity through the lid of the hive, potentially representing a significant saving in energy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In embodiments, beveled outer edges and precise machining can be used to reduce or eliminate spaces between components of a modular hive structure. Additionally, in some embodiments, sealants such as caulking and/or adhesive tape may be used to further restrict spaces between the modular components of the hive. Machining precisely fitting joints between components reduces vectors for pest attacks such as ants and small hive beetles. Moreover, entrances into the hive structure can also be restricted to relatively narrow passages. Restricting an entrance size can reduce hive vulnerability to pests, including ants, wax moths, small hive beetles, and Asian Giant Hornets. Moreover, a number of entrances can be restricted to be relatively low. Thus, attack vectors for invading pests are greatly reduced. Reducing the attack vectors reduces the need for guard bees, as the bees only need to guard a few small openings to secure their hives. This reduction in the number of guard bees means that more bees may contribute to honey production and other behaviors that are more beneficial to the colony and lessen defensive and aggressive behaviors. Additionally, the reduced attack vectors help to reduce overall stress among bees in the colony, which contributes to healthier colonies and better demeanor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The reductions in stress and energy loss may, among other benefits, help to reduce colony disease and loss, which increases crop production in the colonies and thus yields financial benefit to beekeepers. The insulated hive structure also retains the modularity of conventional hive structures required for beekeepers to adequately manage their colonies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The insulated hive structure allows for beehives to be moved into the shade, where it is less taxing on beekeepers to perform their work. Moving the insulated hive structure into the shade is also beneficial to the honeybee's microclimate, as it further reduces the environmental impact on the hive's microclimate by reducing exposure to direct sunlight. Accordingly, less energy is required to be expended by the bees to maintain the stability of the hive's internal conditions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a first aspect, the present disclosure may relate to an apparatus for housing honeybees. The apparatus may include a main body including a plurality of insulated outer walls, with each of the plurality of insulated outer walls comprising an outer surface, an inner surface, and a thermal insulating layer separating the outer surface and an inner surface, wherein the plurality of outer walls are oriented substantially vertically and arranged in a substantially polygonal formation to define a central chamber having a top opening and a bottom opening.

Temperature Drop Comparison</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a graph <b>500</b> showing a temperature curve <b>502</b> of an external area, together with a temperature curve <b>504</b> of an insulated hive system and a temperature curve <b>506</b> of a traditional wooden hive structure. All temperature curves <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> were captured over the same time period. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the insulated hive system <b>100</b> helps to prevent cooling in the brood chamber better than a traditional (e.g., Langstroth) hive structure when the external environment cools. In particular, the external area surrounding both a test hive (e.g., the insulated hive system <b>100</b>) and a traditional hive experienced a sharp temperature drop. This external temperature drop is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the test hive had a significantly higher temperature at the onset of the sudden cooling, due to the insulating aspect of the test hive (e.g., as compared to that of a traditional wooden hive). In particular, the test hive has an R value of 5, versus the traditional hive R value of &#x3c;1. Both hives had reduced entrances, solid floors, solid lids, and no ventilation other than the entrance itself. In a period of 8.5 hours the external temperature dropped from 61.48 degrees Fahrenheit to 37.94 degrees Fahrenheit; a difference of 23.54 degrees, and a 38% drop in temperature. The temperature within the traditional wooden hive dropped from 61.48 degrees Fahrenheit to 42.26 degrees Fahrenheit during the same time frame; a difference of 19.22 degrees, and a 31.3% drop in temperature. In comparison, the temperature within the test hive dropped from 76.46 degrees Fahrenheit to 63.54 degrees Fahrenheit over the same time frame; a difference of 12.92 degrees, and representing a 16.9% drop in temperature. Thus, the test hive was warmer at both the start of the temperature drop and at the time of the lowest external temperature. Moreover, with a 12.92-degree temperature drop in the test hive and a 19.22-degree temperature drop in the traditional wooden hive, the test hive reduced heat loss by 46%.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">B. Temperature Rise Comparison</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The faster temperature rises in a hive, the more bees are recruited to engage in fanning, a method the bees use to maintain a stable temperature in their hives. Hives may be placed in direct sunlight for various reasons, including to discourage pests. However, the conditions created by placing the hive in direct sunlight are generally unfavorable for the bees. Because traditional hives are constructed from wood and other materials with poor resistance to heat, solar heat gain in traditional wooden hives is significant. The large amount of solar heat gain causes bees to start to fan, which represents a loss of workforce, energy, and food stores.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a graph <b>600</b> showing a temperature curve <b>602</b> of an external area, together with a temperature curve <b>604</b> of an insulated hive system and a temperature curve <b>606</b> of a traditional wooden hive structure. All temperature curves <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> were captured over the same time period. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the insulated hive system <b>100</b> helps to resist temperature increase due to solar heat gain overall, and to reduce the speed at which the temperature rises, as compared to a traditional (Langstroth) wooden hive. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the external area surrounding both a test hive (e.g., the insulated hive system <b>100</b>) and a traditional hive did not experience a significant rise in temperature, even though the sun came out. In particular, the outside temperature increased from a low of 47.53 degrees Fahrenheit to a high of 49.84 degrees Fahrenheit, a change in temperature of 2.11 degrees Fahrenheit. During the same time, the traditional hive, which was positioned in direct sunlight, saw a temperature increase from a low of 57.96 degrees Fahrenheit to a high of 78.44 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature change of 20.48 degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the test hive, which was also positioned in direct sunlight, saw a temperature increase from a low of 67.1 degrees Fahrenheit to a high of 75.52 degrees Fahrenheit, a change of 8.42 degrees Fahrenheit. Accordingly, the traditional wooden hive gained heat from solar energy at a pace of 2.4 times that of the insulated hive. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the test hive continued to gain heat even after the outside temperature started to fall. Further, when compared to the test hive, the traditional hive gained heat over a shorter period of time, in addition to gaining significantly more heat. Accordingly, the test hive provides higher lows, lower highs, and a much smoother temperature increase and decrease.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">C. Absolute Humidity Comparison</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Relative humidity cannot be used to accurately compare hive performance. Relative humidity is, as implied by the name, the amount of water vapor present in the air relative to the amount that the air could possibly hold&#x2014;the amount of water vapor in the air as a percentage of the saturation point of at a given temperature. In other words, 80% relative humidity at 95 degrees Fahrenheit is a completely different amount of water vapor than 80% relative humidity at 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or even 105 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">To show differences in performance between the test hive and the traditional (Langstroth) wooden hive, absolute humidity, or the actual amount of water vapor in the air, is measured. The absolute humidity measurement allows for a more effective comparison of hive performance because the measurement is not affected by the temperature of the hives, and allows us to see when levels that impact varroa's fecundity are reached.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The main drivers of hive humidity are water gathering by the brood and evaporation of nectar to make honey. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a graph <b>700</b> showing an absolute humidity curve <b>702</b> of an insulated hive system and an absolute humidity curve <b>704</b> of a traditional wooden hive structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> also shows a temperature curve <b>706</b> of the insulated hive system and a temperature curve <b>708</b> of the traditional wooden hive structure. All curves <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> were captured over the same time period. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the temperature and absolute humidity of the traditional wooden hive in comparison with the temperature and absolute humidity of the test hive over the same time period. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the absolute humidity in the test hive is more stable than the absolute humidity of the traditional wooden hive. The variations in the absolute humidity likely represent a high amount of solar heat gain and the bees using humidity to help mitigate the rapid temperature change. Accordingly, the tests empirically show that the insulated test hive provides greater assistance in maintaining a stable absolute humidity, as compared to the traditional hive.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Absolute humidity levels of &#x3e;30 g/m<sup>3 </sup>cause varroa to lose its fecundity. In general, varroa population grows along with the honeybee population. As nectar begins to flow, the honeybee colony increases brood activities, providing varroa a window to thrive by infecting the brood in the cells just before the cells are capped. Some bees possess a trait called Varroa Sensitive Hygiene. These bees are able to identify brood being exploited by the mite and remove them from the colony. However, many strains of honeybees do not possess this trait. Accordingly, beekeepers rely on chemical treatments called acaricides to mitigate the destruction of the pest. However, when absolute humidity levels in the hive increase above 30 g/m<sup>3</sup>, varroa fecundity (e.g., reproduction) is reduced, helping to mitigate varroa populations while still allowing the colony to reside comfortably in the hive. The test hive can easily reach an absolute humidity of 30 g/m<sup>3 </sup>or more. In contrast, for the traditional hive structure to reach an absolute humidity of 30 g/m<sup>3</sup>, upper ventilation must be greatly reduced or eliminated altogether, and a size of the entrance must be reduced. These conditions can lead to extremely high temperatures within the hive, which risks overheating the bees and leading to the bees abandoning the hive.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">II.

Apparatus/System Use</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To use the insulated hive system, a configured insulated hive system is deployed in a suitable outdoor location. Thereafter, a honeybee colony may be introduced to the deployed insulated hive system. For example, the honeybee colony may be placed within the central chamber.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In use, the honeybee colony may construct honeycomb or other structures in the central chamber. For example, honeycomb or other structures may be built on one or more frames suspended within the central chamber. Additionally, the honeybee colony may work to condition the microclimate within the central chamber. For example, regardless of ambient temperature outside the insulated hive structure, the honeybee colony may regulate the in-hive microclimate of a beehive at the central chamber to maintain a temperature of 35&#xb0; C. The insulated hive structure may help to preserve energy expended by the colony in conditioning the microclimate. Additionally, the insulated hive structure may help to mitigate effects of the ambient climate in the outside world on the microclimate within the central chamber.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">IV.
