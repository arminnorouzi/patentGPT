One example of electrical stimulation provided to a patient is cardiac pacing. Cardiac pacing electrically stimulates the heart when the heart's natural pacemaker and/or conduction system fails to provide synchronized atrial and ventricular contractions at appropriate rates and intervals for a patient's needs. When a patient's heart is beating too slow, bradycardia pacing increases the rate at which the patient's heart contracts to provide relief from symptoms associated with bradycardia. Cardiac pacing may also provide electrical overdrive stimulation intended to suppress or convert tachyarrhythmias, again supplying relief from symptoms and preventing or terminating arrhythmias that could lead to sudden cardiac death or need to be treated with high voltage defibrillation or cardioversion shocks.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pacemakers typically require at least two electrodes to deliver electrical stimulation therapy to the heart and to sense electrical activity of the heart. Traditionally, pacemaker systems are comprised of an implantable pulse generator (or pacemaker) coupled to one or more leads. The lead(s) include one or more electrodes on a distal portion of the lead that are implanted inside the heart such that at least one electrode touches the endocardium. In other examples, the one or more leads can be implanted on the epicardial surface of the heart. In still further examples, leadless pacing devices may be implanted within one or more chambers of the heart and provide pacing pulses to the heart.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present application is directed to implantable cardiac pacing systems and methods for providing substernal pacing. In one embodiment, an implantable cardiac pacing system includes a housing, a first electrode on the housing, a second electrode on the housing, and a pulse generator within the housing and electrically coupled to the first electrode and the second electrode, wherein the housing is implanted substantially within an anterior mediastinum of a patient and the pulse generator is configured to deliver pacing pulses to a heart of the patient via a therapy vector formed between the first and second electrodes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, a method comprises providing a leadless implantable pulse generator (IPG) substantially within an anterior mediastinum of a patient, the leadless IPG including a housing, first electrode on the housing, a second electrode on the housing, and an pulse generator within the housing and electrically coupled to the first electrode and the second electrode, generating one or more stimulation pulses with the implantable pulse generator, and delivering the one or more stimulation pulses to a heart of the patient via the first and second electrode of the leadless IPG implanted substantially within the anterior mediastinum.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is intended to provide an overview of the subject matter described in this disclosure.

However, the techniques of this disclosure may also be used in the context of other implantable medical devices configured to provide electrical stimulation pulses to stimulate other organs, tissues, muscles, or nerves within the body of patient <b>12</b>. For example, leadless IPG <b>10</b> implanted in the manner described herein may provide electrical stimulation pulses to stimulate nerves, skeletal muscles, diaphragmatic muscles, e.g., for various neuro-cardiac applications and/or for apnea or respiration therapy.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Leadless IPG <b>10</b> is implanted underneath/below sternum <b>22</b> substantially within anterior mediastinum <b>28</b>. Anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> may be viewed as being bounded laterally by pleurae <b>32</b>, posteriorly by pericardium <b>30</b>, and anteriorly by sternum <b>22</b>. In some instances, the anterior wall of anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> may also be formed by the transversus thoracis and one or more costal cartilages. Anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> includes a quantity of loose connective tissue (such as areolar tissue), some lymph vessels, lymph glands, sub sternal musculature (e.g., transverse thoracic muscle), branches of the internal thoracic artery, and the internal thoracic vein. For example, leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted substantially within the loose connective tissue and/or substernal musculature of anterior mediastinum <b>28</b>. A leadless IPG implanted substantially within anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> will be referred to herein as a substernal leadless IPG. Also, electrical stimulation, such as pacing, provided by a leadless IPG implanted substantially within anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> will be referred to herein as substernal electrical stimulation or substernal pacing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although leadless IPG <b>10</b> is described herein as being implanted substantially within anterior mediastinum <b>28</b>, leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted in other non-vascular, extra-pericardial locations, including the gap, tissue, or other anatomical features around the perimeter of and adjacent to, but not attached to, the pericardium or other portion of heart <b>26</b> and not above sternum <b>22</b> or ribcage. As such, leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted anywhere within the &#x201c;substernal space&#x201d; defined by the undersurface between the sternum and/or ribcage and the body cavity but not including the pericardium or other portion of heart <b>26</b>.

In other words, leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted in the region around the outer surface of heart <b>26</b>, but not attached to heart <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Leadless IPG <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>14</b> having electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. Leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted substantially within anterior mediastinum <b>28</b> such that leadless IPG <b>10</b> can sense electrical activity of heart <b>26</b> and/or deliver electrical stimulation, e.g., pacing, to heart <b>26</b> via electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. In one example, leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted such that electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are located substantially over a cardiac silhouette of one or both ventricles as observed via an anterior-posterior (AP) fluoroscopic view of heart <b>26</b>. In another example leadless IPG <b>10</b> may be implanted such that a bipolar therapy vector between electrodes <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> is centered or otherwise located over the ventricle(s).

An incision was made near the xiphoid process and a Model 4194 lead was delivered to the substernal/retrosternal space using a 6996T tunneling tool and sheath. An active can emulator (ACE) was placed in a subcutaneous pocket on either the right chest (first acute experiment) or the left midaxillary (second and third acute experiments). Various pacing configurations were tried and different pieces of equipment were used as the source of stimulation. Multiple pulse widths were used in delivering the pacing pulse. Across experiments, several different substernal/retrosternal lead electrode locations were utilized.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the second and third experiments the impact of lead location on electrical performance was investigated by moving the lead to several locations under the sternum and collecting data to generate strength-duration curves at each location.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In all three acute experiments, the substernal/retrosternal lead was placed and electrical data collected. The lead was moved intentionally many times across experiments to better understand the location best suited to capturing the heart at low pacing thresholds, with different locations and parameters tried until pacing capability was gained and lost. A range of thresholds based on location and pacing configuration was recorded. For this reason, the lowest threshold result for each acute experiment is reported, as are strength-duration curves showing the range of pacing values obtained from suitable pacing locations. In all cases, it was determined that positioning the substernal/retrosternal pacing electrode approximately over the ventricle of the cardiac silhouette provided best results.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Experiment 1</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the first acute study, a MEDTRONIC ATTAIN bipolar OTW 4194 lead (referred to herein as &#x201c;the 4194 lead&#x201d;)was implanted substernally, and two active can emulators were positioned, one in the right dorsal lateral region (ACE1) and one on the right midaxillary (ACE2).

It should be noted that the threshold value obtained at 1.5ms was always recorded using the Medtronic 2290 analyzer as the stimulation source, wheras all other threshold measurements for the first acute experiment (at pulse widths of 2, 10, 15 and 20 ms) were obtained using a Frederick Heir instrument as the source of stimulation.

Additionally, thresholds of 8 and 9 volts were obtained with the lead in the second anatomical position, both from 4194 tip to ACE (unipolar) and 4194 tip to ring (bipolar) configurations at multiple pulse widths.

As in the previous two acute experiments, a 4194 lead was placed under the sternum. An active can emulator was placed on the left midaxillary. In this experiment, the substernal/retrosternal 4194 lead was intentionally positioned so that the lead tip was initially near the second rib, far above the cardiac silhouette of the ventricle. The lead tip was then pulled back (toward the xiphoid process) one rib space at a time, collecting electrical data at each position. As in previous experiments, low capture thresholds were obtained when the pacing electrodes were approximately positioned over the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette, as observed via fluoroscopy. When the lead tip was not over the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette, &#x201c;no capture&#x201d; was often the result.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As in previous experiments, pacing was performed from either the tip or the ring of the substernal/retrosternal 4194 lead (&#x2212;) to the ACE (+) on the left midaxillary. However, in this acute experiment, a subcutaneous ICD lead was also positioned in its subcutaneous arrangement (as illustrated and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>). In some instances, the pacing configuration was from either the tip or the ring of the substernal/retrosternal 4194 lead (&#x2212;) to either the ring or the coil of the subcutaneous ICD lead (+), so that the ICD lead and not the ACE was the indifferent electrode.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The smallest threshold observed across the experiment was 0.8V, obtained when pacing from the substernal/retrosternal 4194 tip electrode (&#x2212;) to an ACE (+) on the left midaxillary when the lead was positioned such that the lead tip electrode was approximately under the sixth rib (20 ms pulse width and Frederick Heir stimulator). Many additional low thresholds were obtained with different pacing configurations, shorter pulse durations and different lead positions, again demonstrating the feasibility of substernal/retrosternal pacing.

Thresholds were higher overall in this anatomical location (the lead tip near the 5<sup>th </sup>rib), though capture was still possible and in the 4194 ring (&#x2212;) to ACE (+) configuration, moderately low (2 volts at 20 ms). There generally was no significant extra-cardiac stimulation observed except with pulse widths of 0.2 ms and 0.5 ms in the 4194 tip (&#x2212;) to ACE (+) configuration and in the unipolar configuration going from the 4194 tip (&#x2212;) to the coil of the subcutaneous ICD lead at pulse widths of 1.5 ms and shorter, all of which resulted in the highest recorded threshold readings in this lead position.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates the strength-duration curve of electrical data from the third acute experiment when the 4194 lead tip was positioned under the sternum at the location of the 6<sup>th </sup>rib. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the position dependence of the substernal/retrosternal electrode. When the pacing electrode is optimally located over the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette (as observed via fluoroscopy), pacing threshold is low. Low thresholds were very repeatable in this anatomical location, even at shorter pulse durations and in many different pacing configurations. Extra-cardiac stimulation generally was not apparent at low thresholds and longer pulse durations throughout this experiment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">All three acute experiments demonstrated the feasibility of pacing from a substernal/retrosternal electrode location. The lowest threshold results across the three acute procedures were 0.8 volts, 7 volts and 0.8 volts, respectively, with the second acute procedure involving an anatomical difference (pericardial adhesions) that tipped the ventricular surface of the heart away from its normal orientation with the sternum, resulting in higher pacing thresholds. However, for the purposes of anti-tachycardia pacing, conventional devices typically default to maximum output (8V at 1.5 ms) for ATP therapy delivery. Given this, even the 7V threshold obtained in the second acute experiment could be satisfactory for ATP therapy.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The ability to capture the heart at low pacing thresholds was dependent upon electrode position. As observed through these experiments, the substernal/retrosternal pacing electrode provides the best outcomes when positioned approximately over the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette, which is easily observed via fluoroscopy and encompasses a reasonably large target area for lead placement. In the third acute experiment, for example, capture was achieved at three separate positions, with the lead tip at approximately ribs 4, 5 and 6, all of which were near the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Pacing thresholds increased with shorter pulse durations. In many instances, however, low pacing thresholds were obtained even at short pulse widths, especially when the substernal/retrosternal pacing electrode was positioned over the ventricular surface of the cardiac silhouette. In other instances, longer pulse durations (10-20 ms) were necessary to obtain capture or to achieve lower capture thresholds.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Across experiments, it was possible to pace from the substernal/retrosternal lead to an active can emulator positioned near the animal's side (unipolar) and also from the substernal/retrosternal lead to a subcutaneous ICD lead (unipolar). If a subcutaneous ICD system incorporated a lead, placed substernally, for the purpose of anti-tachycardia pacing, both of the aforementioned unipolar pacing configurations would be available for a physician to choose from.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">These experiments also demonstrated the ability to pace in a bipolar configuration entirely under the sternum (4194 tip (&#x2212;) to 4194 ring (+), substernally), indicating that either a bipolar lead positioned under the sternum might be used for anti-tachycardia pacing purposes.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Overall, the results of these acute experiments demonstrate the ability to pace the heart from a substernal/retrosternal location, with the lead not entering the vasculature or the pericardial space, nor making intimate contact with the heart. The low threshold values obtained when pacing from a substernal/retrosternal lead location in these acute experiments suggest that pain-free pacing for the purpose of anti-tachycardia pacing in a subcutaneous ICD system is within reach.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some instances, the electrodes of the various leadless IPGs described herein may be shaped, oriented, designed or otherwise configured to reduce extra-cardiac stimulation.
