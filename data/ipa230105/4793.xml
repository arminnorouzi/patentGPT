Computer vision applications may make possible various automated commercial, industrial, and consumer processes, such as computer-assisted manufacturing, computer-assisted surveillance, computer-assisted navigation, computer-assisted automobile driving, and a variety of other types of automatic and/or robotic processes. Such computer-assisted applications may bring about increases in manufacturing productivity, increases in the accuracy of industrial processes, increases in the quality of manufactured products, as well as reductions in costs associated with industrial and manufacturing processes. In an industrial and/or manufacturing setting, computer-vision applications may bring about increases in industrial safety by reducing or eliminating the need for human operators to work in potentially dangerous and safety-compromised environments. In a personal/consumer setting, computer-assisted automobile driving may enhance safety for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and occupants of nearby vehicles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer-assisted processes, which may include computer-vision techniques, as well as computer-assisted techniques operating in other sensory domains (e.g., audio, olfactory, etc.) may utilize a computer model, for example, to guide a computer-assisted process.

Furthermore, it is to be understood that particular features, structures, characteristics, and/or the like described are capable of being combined in various ways in one or more implementations and/or embodiments and, therefore, are within intended claim scope. In general, of course, as has always been the case for the specification of a patent application, these and other issues have a potential to vary in a particular context of usage. In other words, throughout the patent application, particular context of description and/or usage provides guidance regarding reasonable inferences to be drawn; however, likewise, &#x201c;in this context&#x201d; in general without further qualification refers to the context of the present patent application.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As previously alluded to, in a computer-vision application a computing device coupled to, for example, an imaging sensor (e.g., a camera) may operate to detect one or more features or entities present in a captured image. In some instances, a computing device may employ a discriminator, which may allow the computing device to differentiate between and/or among various features or entities present in a captured image. In other types of computer-assisted applications, such as computer-assisted voice-to-text applications, a computing device coupled to an audio device (e.g., a microphone) may operate to detect one or more phonemes, words, or phrases present in electrical signals representing an audio stream. In still other types of computer-assisted applications, such as computer-assisted airborne chemical detection devices and/or olfactory sensing devices, a computing device may detect presence of volatile, potentially harmful, airborne chemical agents. These computer-assisted applications, and a variety of other computer-assisted applications, may permit automation of numerous commercial and industrial processes, such as computer-assisted manufacturing, computer-assisted surveillance, computer-assisted navigation, and numerous other automatic and/or robotic processes. Computer-assisted applications may additionally bring about increases in industrial safety by reducing or eliminating the need for human operators to work in potentially dangerous and safety-compromised environments. In a personal/consumer setting, computer-assisted automobile navigation, which may include vehicle speed and breaking control, adherence to a planned and/or preprogrammed route, object avoidance, and so forth, may enhance safety for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and occupants of nearby vehicles.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Computer-assisted applications, may rely, at least to some extent, on a stored model and/or other type of representation of a real-world entity, which may serve as a basis of comparison between and/or among the real-world entity and the stored model and/or representation. Accordingly, in a computer vision application, for example, the application may detect presence of a feature and/or an entity in a captured image by performing a comparison operation between and/or among a portion of an image and the stored model and/or representation. In another example, a computer-assisted voice-to-text application may detect presence of a particular word and/or phrase by comparing electrical signals representing a portion of an audio stream with a stored model and/or representation of the particular word and/or phrase. In another example, a computer-assisted airborne chemical detection device may determine presence of a chemical agent by comparing electrical signals from a chemical detector with a stored representation of electrical impulses representing presence of particular airborne chemicals and/or compounds. Numerous other computer-assisted applications are possible, in which real-world entities are detected via comparison with stored models and/or representations, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in many instances, it may be difficult, costly, and/or time-consuming to develop accurate computer models and/or representations of real-world entities. For example, in a computer-vision application that attempts to discriminate between and/or among features and/or entities present in a captured visual observation, obtaining depth parameters may permit differentiation between and/or among entities located relatively near a camera lens versus entities located relatively far from the camera lens. Although depth-of-field parameters of a scene may be determined via the use of a ranging sensor, such as a light detection and ranging (LI DAR) sensor, obtaining such measurements may represent a time-consuming process involving numerous discrete range-sensing operations. In some instances, depth-of-field parameters of the scene may be determined only after conducting thousands of discrete LIDAR measurements at a corresponding number of separate locations of a scene. In other instances, such as those involving computer-assisted applications other than those relating to computer vision, development of a model and/or representation of an audio stream, a chemical profile, etc., may also involve performing a large number of discrete measurements in an audio, sonar, infrared, wireless signal strength, or other type of domain.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another approach, a human operator may be utilized to supervise a process of developing an accurate model and/or other type of representation of a real-world entity. In such an approach, a human operator may be tasked with presenting an entity to, for example, a computer-vision sensor and, following such presentation, determine whether the computing device has accurately detected the entity. Dependent upon whether the computing device has accurately detected presence of a particular entity, the human operator may modify one or more detection parameters utilized by the computer to detect presence of the particular entity. However, it may be appreciated that such a process may represent a laborious and repetitive course of actions to develop an accurate computer model and/or other type of representation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, in accordance with particular embodiments, digitally stored entities, which in this context denote digitally-represented entities that include, but are not limited to digitally stored entities generated by a computing device or actual, real-world entities for which representations are stored in a digital domain. Digitally stored entities generated by a computing device may encompass visual entities, such as visual entities generated by way of a computer executing a set of instructions, audio entities generated by way of the computer executing a set of instructions, chemical and/or olfactory entities generated by way of the computer executing a set of instructions, or may include any other entity for which a representation may be stored within a memory of a computing device. A digitally stored entity may represent an image obtained from, gleaned from, and/or assembled from, for example, a logical location accessible via the Internet. Accordingly, in an example, a digitally stored entity, such as an image of an apple or an image of a traffic sign, may be gleaned and/or assembled from two or more available visual images and/or other types of representations available on the Internet. Alternatively, or in addition to, gleaning a digital image of an apple from available images and/or other representations, for example, a digitally stored entity may be augmented, such as distorted, re-colored, lightened, darkened, enlarged in size, reduced in size, fragmented, and/or modified in some other way, prior to presentation for review by the computing device. The computing device may, in turn, utilizing one or more parameters of a training function, indicate whether the digitally stored entity has been detected in a computer-generated observation. Responsive to the computing device accurately detecting the digitally stored entity in, for example, a computer-generated observation, parameters of the training function may remain unmodified. However, responsive to the computing device failing to detect and entity or failing to discriminate a between and/or among entities present in a computer-generated observation, one or more parameters of a training function may be modified.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular embodiments, training a sensing system to detect real-world entities using digitally stored entities may utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) to perform unsupervised (e.g., autonomous and/or without user input) development and/or refinement of parameters of a training function. The one or more digitally stored entities may be evaluated and/or reviewed by a computing device without the benefit of obtaining an advanced indication of the generated one or more entities. Responsive to a computing device inaccurately identifying and/or failing to detect a generated digitally stored entity, one or more parameters of a training function utilized by a computing device may be modified. In response to modification of parameters of a training function, a GAN may present the same or a similar digitally stored entity for review by the computing device. Responsive to a computing device inaccurately identifying and/or failing to detect a generated digitally stored entity, one or more parameters of a training function utilized by a computing device may be further modified. Accordingly, at least in particular embodiments, a GAN may iteratively repeat a process of generation of an entity in a digital domain, followed by attempted detection, refinement of parameters of a training function, and generation of another entity in a digital domain. In particular nonlimiting embodiments, such an iterative process may be referred to as a cycle-GAN process.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As previously mentioned, a cycle-GAN process may involve thousands, millions, tens of millions, or an even greater number (virtually without limitation) of cycles involving generation of a first digitally stored entity, detection of the first digitally stored entity, parameter modification in response to such detection, followed by generation of a second digitally stored entity, detection of the second digitally stored entity, and so forth. In particular embodiments, a cycle-GAN process may proceed without user input (e.g., autonomously), which may represent an inexpensive approach toward training a sensing system to detect real-world entities utilizing computer-generated, computer-augmented, computer-assembled, or entities otherwise obtained via a computing device (e.g., computer-generated) entities.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular embodiments, responsive to a cycle-GAN process that yields relatively accurate detection and/or discrimination of entities formed in a digital domain, real-world entities may be evaluated in lieu of digitally stored entities. In many instances, responsive to the extensive refinement of parameters of a training function to detect entities in a digital domain, such as via a cycle-GAN process, the training function may be adapted to operate, instead, utilizing real-world entities. In particular embodiments, such as embodiments involve being commercially available robotic computer-assisted devices (e.g., robotic in-home vacuum cleaners) a cycle-GAN process, for example, may be occasionally or periodically performed. Thus, in some instances, responsive to a computerized robotic vacuum cleaner failing to recognize a real-world entity in a room of a particular residence, a cycle-GAN process can be invoked, which may operate to refine one or more parameters of a training function. Accordingly, such refinements in training may operate to focus and/or to restrict refinement of a training function to exclusive problematic areas. In another example, such as computer-assisted automobile control, a cycle-GAN process can be occasionally or periodically invoked, which may operate to refine one or more parameters of a training function specific to a driving environment of an individual user.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing operation of a sensing system during a training process for detecting real-world entities using digitally stored entities, according to an embodiment <b>100</b>.

Accordingly, digital domain <b>110</b> may correspond to, for example, a two-dimensional memory array, within which observations that include representations of entities <b>115</b>A-<b>115</b>Z may be virtually formed.

Additionally, entities stored within digital domain <b>110</b> may correspond to observations including entities other than predominantly visual entities, such as, for example, computer-generated and/or computer-augmented soundbites or other extracts from actual (e.g., real-world) sounds. Thus, observations including entities <b>115</b> stored within digital domain <b>110</b> may correspond to any type of computer-generated sounds, such as those generated by a human or by an animal. Additionally, in particular embodiments, observations that include entities stored within digital domain <b>110</b> may correspond to other computer-generated entities, such as, for example, observations that include a chemical profile of an airborne compound or of an ensemble of compounds, or may correspond to observations including any other computer-generated (virtual) entity, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.

Thus, responsive to detector <b>130</b> correctly classifying and/or discriminating between and/or among received digitally stored entities, parameters of training function <b>140</b>, such as parameter {i}, {ii}, . . . , {n}, may remain unchanged or unmodified.

Thus, parameters of training function <b>140</b> may be enhanced so as to more easily (e.g., with greater probability) and successfully discriminate between and/or among entities, such as digitally storable entities, which may correspond to entities encountered in a real-world environment.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, entity detection may correspond to operations performed by detector <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Depth estimation <b>325</b> may involve determination of a distance from a sensing element, such as a camera lens, and so forth. Scene classification <b>330</b> may correspond to a process in which scenes from photographs are categorically classified, such as pertaining to people, sporting events, ceremonies, parades, natural settings, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Alternatively, sensor <b>350</b> may correspond to an audio sensor, such as a microphone, which may operate to obtain an observation of audio signals present in an audio environment, such as one or more sounds, one or more phonemes, one or more words, one or more phrases, one or more sentences, etc. Thus, as shown by dotted line <b>355</b>, translation <b>340</b> may allow phoneme detection <b>360</b> (e.g., detection of a constituent portion of a word or phrase) and language detection <b>360</b> (e.g., detection of the English language with respect to any other spoken language).

In one possible example, performance of an automatic housecleaning device, such as a household robotic vacuum cleaner, may be enhanced via additional training to adapt and/or customize parameters of a particular household environment. Continuing with such an example, responsive to a translation of an automated housecleaning device being trained utilizing an office environment (as opposed to a domestic household environment), which may comprise a substantial percentage of desks and office chairs, the robotic device may benefit from additional training in a domestic household environment. Accordingly, as an automated housecleaning device moves from room to room in the household environment, in which the device senses household entities such as furniture, sofas, bare and carpeted floors, etc., sampler <b>310</b> may determine a distribution of certain types of entities in relation to other types of entities. Thus, responsive to such sampling, sampler <b>310</b> may determine that additional training and/or optimization of parameters {i}, {II}, . . . {n} is warranted. Such additional training may enhance detection and discrimination between and/or among entities encountered by the automated housecleaning device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In another example, described here and in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, sampler <b>310</b> may operate to customize and/or adapt a translation to a particular distribution of real-world entities encountered while navigating an automobile in differing environments. For example, although a translation may correspond to a sufficiently or fully trained function, it is possible that parameters {i}, {ii}, . . . {n} may benefit from being tailored to a particular driving environments encountered from place to place. Thus, a computer-assisted automobile navigation system, which may operate to recognize particular real-world entities encountered while driving, may be enhanced via additional training to adapt and/or customize parameters of a particular driving environment. Thus, in an example, responsive to a translation of a computer-assisted automobile navigation system being initially trained in an urban environment, wherein a presence of a large number of (human) pedestrians may be encountered, the computer-assisted system may benefit from additional training to operate safely in a rural/desert environment. Accordingly, as an automobile is piloted through rural environments, in which sensor <b>350</b> senses a presence of certain wildlife, sampler <b>310</b> may determine a distribution of specific types of animals in relation to other types of animals. Thus, responsive to such detections, sampler <b>310</b> may determine that additional training and/or optimization of parameters {i}, {II}, . . . {n} is warranted. Such additional training may enhance detection and/or discrimination between and/or among particular types of animals that come into view of sensor <b>350</b> of the computer-assisted automobile navigation system responsive to operation in a rural environment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In response to sampler <b>310</b> detecting a distribution of sensed real-world entities, sampler <b>310</b> may operate to query real-world entities database <b>320</b>.

Such additional imagery may correspond to captured images of encountered entities, such as images of furniture, sofas, bare floors, and so forth. As mentioned previously, such additional real-world entities may operate to adapt a translation to a particular distribution of images, which may increase the probability of detection of a real-world entity in a visual scene, for example, entity feature detection (such as depth of certain features of an entity versus depth of other features of an entity present in a scene), and/or scene classification, among detection of other features.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram showing use of a translation in a sensing system to detect various attributes of a real-world image, according to an embodiment <b>400</b>.

Computing device <b>604</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, is merely one example, and claimed subject matter is not limited in scope to this particular example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">For one or more embodiments, a device, such as a computing device and/or networking device, may comprise, for example, any of a wide range of digital electronic devices, including, but not limited to, desktop and/or notebook computers, high-definition televisions, digital versatile disc (DVD) and/or other optical disc players and/or recorders, game consoles, satellite television receivers, cellular telephones, tablet devices, wearable devices, personal digital assistants, mobile audio and/or video playback and/or recording devices, Internet of Things (IOT) type devices, or any combination of the foregoing. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, a process as described, such as with reference to flow diagrams and/or otherwise, may also be executed and/or affected, in whole or in part, by a computing device and/or a network device. A device, such as a computing device and/or network device, may vary in terms of capabilities and/or features. Claimed subject matter is intended to cover a wide range of potential variations. For example, a device may include a numeric keypad and/or other display of limited functionality, such as a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD) for displaying text, for example. In contrast, however, as another example, a web-enabled device may include a physical and/or a virtual keyboard, mass storage, one or more accelerometers, one or more gyroscopes, global positioning system (GPS) and/or other location-identifying type capability, and/or a display with a higher degree of functionality, such as a touch-sensitive color 2D or 3D display, for example.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">As suggested previously, communications between a computing device and/or a network device and a wireless network may be in accordance with known and/or to be developed network protocols including, for example, global system for mobile communications (GSM), enhanced data rate for GSM evolution (EDGE), 802.11b/g/n/h, etc., and/or worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX). A computing device and/or a networking device may also have a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, which, for example, may comprise a detachable or embedded smart card that is able to store subscription content of a user, and/or is also able to store a contact list. It is noted, however, that a SIM card may also be electronic, meaning that is may simply be stored in a particular location in memory of the computing and/or networking device. A user may own the computing device and/or network device or may otherwise be a user, such as a primary user, for example. A device may be assigned an address by a wireless network operator, a wired network operator, and/or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). For example, an address may comprise a domestic or international telephone number, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, and/or one or more other identifiers. In other embodiments, a computing and/or communications network may be embodied as a wired network, wireless network, or any combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A computing and/or network device may include and/or may execute a variety of now known and/or to be developed operating systems, derivatives and/or versions thereof, including computer operating systems, such as Windows, iOS, Linux, a mobile operating system, such as iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, and/or the like. A computing device and/or network device may include and/or may execute a variety of possible applications, such as a client software application enabling communication with other devices. For example, one or more messages (e.g., content) may be communicated, such as via one or more protocols, now known and/or later to be developed, suitable for communication of email, short message service (SMS), and/or multimedia message service (MMS), including via a network, such as a social network, formed at least in part by a portion of a computing and/or communications network, including, but not limited to, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and/or Flickr, to provide only a few examples. A computing and/or network device may also include executable computer instructions to process and/or communicate digital content, such as, for example, textual content, digital multimedia content, and/or the like. A computing and/or network device may also include executable computer instructions to perform a variety of possible tasks, such as browsing, searching, playing various forms of digital content, including locally stored and/or streamed video, and/or games such as, but not limited to, fantasy sports leagues. The foregoing is provided merely to illustrate that claimed subject matter is intended to include a wide range of possible features and/or capabilities.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, computing device <b>602</b> may provide one or more sources of executable computer instructions in the form physical states and/or signals (e.g., stored in memory states), for example. Computing device <b>602</b> may communicate with computing device <b>604</b> by way of a network connection, such as via network <b>608</b>, for example. As previously mentioned, a connection, while physical, may not necessarily be tangible. Although computing device <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows various tangible, physical components, claimed subject matter is not limited to a computing devices having only these tangible components as other implementations and/or embodiments may include alternative arrangements that may comprise additional tangible components or fewer tangible components, for example, that function differently while achieving similar results. Rather, examples are provided merely as illustrations. It is not intended that claimed subject matter be limited in scope to illustrative examples.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Memory <b>622</b> may comprise any non-transitory storage medium. Memory <b>622</b> may comprise, for example, primary memory <b>624</b> and secondary memory <b>626</b>, additional memory circuits, media, or combinations thereof may be used. Memory <b>622</b> may comprise, for example, random access memory, read only memory, etc., such as in the form of one or more storage devices and/or systems, such as, for example, a disk drive including an optical disc drive, a tape drive, a solid-state memory drive, etc., just to name a few examples.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Memory <b>622</b> may be utilized to store a program of executable computer instructions. For example, processor <b>620</b> may fetch executable instructions from memory and proceed to execute the fetched instructions. Memory <b>622</b> may also comprise a memory controller for accessing device readable-medium <b>640</b> that may carry and/or make accessible digital content, which may include code, and/or instructions, for example, executable by processor <b>620</b> and/or some other device, such as a controller, as one example, capable of executing computer instructions, for example. Under direction of processor <b>620</b>, a non-transitory memory, such as memory cells storing physical states (e.g., memory states), comprising, for example, a program of executable computer instructions, may be executed by processor <b>620</b> and able to generate signals to be communicated via a network, for example, as previously described. Generated signals may also be stored in memory, also previously suggested.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Memory <b>622</b> may store electronic files and/or electronic documents, such as relating to one or more users, and may also comprise a computer-readable medium that may carry and/or make accessible content, including code and/or instructions, for example, executable by processor <b>620</b> and/or some other device, such as a controller, as one example, capable of executing computer instructions, for example. As previously mentioned, the term electronic file and/or the term electronic document are used throughout this document to refer to a set of stored memory states and/or a set of physical signals associated in a manner so as to thereby form an electronic file and/or an electronic document. That is, it is not meant to implicitly reference a particular syntax, format and/or approach used, for example, with respect to a set of associated memory states and/or a set of associated physical signals. It is further noted an association of memory states, for example, may be in a logical sense and not necessarily in a tangible, physical sense. Thus, although signal and/or state components of an electronic file and/or electronic document, are to be associated logically, storage thereof, for example, may reside in one or more different places in a tangible, physical memory, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Algorithmic descriptions and/or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the signal processing and/or related arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is, in the context of the present patent application, and generally, is considered to be a self-consistent sequence of operations and/or similar signal processing leading to a desired result. In the context of the present patent application, operations and/or processing involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically, although not necessarily, such quantities may take the form of electrical and/or magnetic signals and/or states capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, processed and/or otherwise manipulated, for example, as electronic signals and/or states making up components of various forms of digital content, such as signal measurements, text, images, video, audio, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to such physical signals and/or physical states as bits, values, elements, parameters, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, numerals, measurements, content and/or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these and/or similar terms are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the preceding discussion, it is appreciated that throughout this specification discussions utilizing terms such as &#x201c;processing,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing,&#x201d; &#x201c;calculating,&#x201d; &#x201c;determining&#x201d;, &#x201c;establishing&#x201d;, &#x201c;obtaining&#x201d;, &#x201c;identifying&#x201d;, &#x201c;selecting&#x201d;, &#x201c;generating&#x201d;, and/or the like may refer to actions and/or processes of a specific apparatus, such as a special purpose computer and/or a similar special purpose computing and/or network device. In the context of this specification, therefore, a special purpose computer and/or a similar special purpose computing and/or network device is capable of processing, manipulating and/or transforming signals and/or states, typically in the form of physical electronic and/or magnetic quantities, within memories, registers, and/or other storage devices, processing devices, and/or display devices of the special purpose computer and/or similar special purpose computing and/or network device. In the context of this particular patent application, as mentioned, the term &#x201c;specific apparatus&#x201d; therefore includes a general purpose computing and/or network device, such as a general purpose computer, once it is programmed to perform particular functions, such as pursuant to program software instructions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">In some circumstances, operation of a memory device, such as a change in state from a binary one to a binary zero or vice-versa, for example, may comprise a transformation, such as a physical transformation. With particular types of memory devices, such a physical transformation may comprise a physical transformation of an article to a different state or thing. For example, but without limitation, for some types of memory devices, a change in state may involve an accumulation and/or storage of charge or a release of stored charge. Likewise, in other memory devices, a change of state may comprise a physical change, such as a transformation in magnetic orientation. Likewise, a physical change may comprise a transformation in molecular structure, such as from crystalline form to amorphous form or vice-versa. In still other memory devices, a change in physical state may involve quantum mechanical phenomena, such as, superposition, entanglement, and/or the like, which may involve quantum bits (qubits), for example. The foregoing is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all examples in which a change in state from a binary one to a binary zero or vice-versa in a memory device may comprise a transformation, such as a physical, but non-transitory, transformation. Rather, the foregoing is intended as illustrative examples.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, processor <b>620</b> may comprise one or more circuits, such as digital circuits, to perform at least a portion of a computing procedure and/or process. By way of example, but not limitation, processor <b>620</b> may comprise one or more processors, such as controllers, microprocessors, microcontrollers, application specific integrated circuits, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field programmable gate arrays, the like, or any combination thereof. In various implementations and/or embodiments, processor <b>620</b> may perform signal processing, typically substantially in accordance with fetched executable computer instructions, such as to manipulate signals and/or states, to construct signals and/or states, etc., with signals and/or states generated in such a manner to be communicated and/or stored in memory, for example.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> also illustrates device <b>604</b> as including a component <b>632</b> operable with input/output devices, for example, so that signals and/or states may be appropriately communicated between and/or among devices, such as device <b>604</b> and an input device and/or device <b>604</b> and an output device. A user may make use of an input device, such as a computer mouse, stylus, track ball, keyboard, and/or any other similar device capable of receiving user actions and/or motions as input signals. Likewise, for a device having speech to text capability, a user may speak to a device to generate input signals. A user may make use of an output device, such as a display, a printer, etc., and/or any other device capable of providing signals and/or generating stimuli for a user, such as visual stimuli, audio stimuli and/or other similar stimuli.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;connection,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;component&#x201d; and/or similar terms are intended to be physical, but are not necessarily always tangible. Whether or not these terms refer to tangible subject matter, thus, may vary in a particular context of usage. As an example, a tangible connection and/or tangible connection path may be made, such as by a tangible, electrical connection, such as an electrically conductive path comprising metal or other conductor, that is able to conduct electrical current between and/or among two tangible components. Likewise, a tangible connection path may be at least partially affected and/or controlled, such that, as is typical, a tangible connection path may be open or closed, at times resulting from influence of one or more externally derived signals, such as external currents and/or voltages, such as for an electrical switch. Non-limiting illustrations of an electrical switch include a transistor, a diode, etc. However, a &#x201c;connection&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;component,&#x201d; in a particular context of usage, likewise, although physical, can also be non-tangible, such as a connection between and/or among one or more clients and one or more servers over a network, particularly a wireless network, which generally refers to the ability for the client and server to transmit, receive, and/or exchange communications, as discussed in more detail later.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In a particular context of usage, such as a particular context in which tangible components are being discussed, therefore, the terms &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected&#x201d; are used in a manner so that the terms are not synonymous. Similar terms may also be used in a manner in which a similar intention is exhibited. Thus, &#x201c;connected&#x201d; is used to indicate that two or more tangible components and/or the like, for example, are tangibly in direct physical contact. Thus, using the previous example, two tangible components that are electrically connected are physically connected via a tangible electrical connection, as previously discussed. However, &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; is used to mean that potentially two or more tangible components are tangibly in direct physical contact. Nonetheless, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is also used to mean that two or more tangible components and/or the like are not necessarily tangibly in direct physical contact, but are able to co-operate, liaise, and/or interact, such as, for example, by being &#x201c;optically coupled.&#x201d; Likewise, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is also understood to mean indirectly connected. It is further noted, in the context of the present patent application, since memory, such as a memory component and/or memory states, is intended to be non-transitory, the term physical, at least if used in relation to memory necessarily implies that such memory components and/or memory states, continuing with the example, are tangible.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Additionally, in the present patent application, in a particular context of usage, such as a situation in which tangible components (and/or similarly, tangible materials) are being discussed, a distinction exists between being &#x201c;on&#x201d; and being &#x201c;over.&#x201d; As an example, deposition of a substance &#x201c;on&#x201d; a substrate refers to a deposition involving direct physical and tangible contact without an intermediary, such as an intermediary substance, between the substance deposited and the substrate in this latter example; nonetheless, deposition &#x201c;over&#x201d; a substrate, while understood to potentially include deposition &#x201c;on&#x201d; a substrate (since being &#x201c;on&#x201d; may also accurately be described as being &#x201c;over&#x201d;), is understood to include a situation in which one or more intermediaries, such as one or more intermediary substances, are present between the substance deposited and the substrate so that the substance deposited is not necessarily in direct physical and tangible contact with the substrate.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">A similar distinction is made in an appropriate particular context of usage, such as in which tangible materials and/or tangible components are discussed, between being &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; and being &#x201c;under.&#x201d; While &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; in such a particular context of usage, is intended to necessarily imply physical and tangible contact (similar to &#x201c;on,&#x201d; as just described), &#x201c;under&#x201d; potentially includes a situation in which there is direct physical and tangible contact, but does not necessarily imply direct physical and tangible contact, such as if one or more intermediaries, such as one or more intermediary substances, are present. Thus, &#x201c;on&#x201d; is understood to mean &#x201c;immediately over&#x201d; and &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; is understood to mean &#x201c;immediately under.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">It is likewise appreciated that terms such as &#x201c;over&#x201d; and &#x201c;under&#x201d; are understood in a similar manner as the terms &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; and so on, previously mentioned. These terms may be used to facilitate discussion, but are not intended to necessarily restrict scope of claimed subject matter. For example, the term &#x201c;over,&#x201d; as an example, is not meant to suggest that claim scope is limited to only situations in which an embodiment is right side up, such as in comparison with the embodiment being upside down, for example. An example includes a flip chip, as one illustration, in which, for example, orientation at various times (e.g., during fabrication) may not necessarily correspond to orientation of a final product. Thus, if a feature, as an example, is within applicable claim scope in a particular orientation, such as upside down, as one example, likewise, it is intended that the latter also be interpreted to be included within applicable claim scope in another orientation, such as right side up, again, as an example, and vice-versa, even if applicable literal claim language has the potential to be interpreted otherwise. Of course, again, as always has been the case in the specification of a patent application, particular context of description and/or usage provides helpful guidance regarding reasonable inferences to be drawn.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">Unless otherwise indicated, in the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; if used to associate a list, such as A, B, or C, is intended to mean A, B, and C, here used in the inclusive sense, as well as A, B, or C, here used in the exclusive sense. With this understanding, &#x201c;and&#x201d; is used in the inclusive sense and intended to mean A, B, and C; whereas &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; can be used in an abundance of caution to make clear that all of the foregoing meanings are intended, although such usage is not required. In addition, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; and/or similar terms is used to describe any feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like in the singular, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; is also used to describe a plurality and/or some other combination of features, structures, characteristics, and/or the like. Likewise, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood as not necessarily intending to convey an exhaustive list of factors, but to allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Furthermore, it is intended, for a situation that relates to implementation of claimed subject matter and is subject to testing, measurement, and/or specification regarding degree, that the particular situation be understood in the following manner. As an example, in a given situation, assume a value of a physical property is to be measured. If, alternatively, reasonable approaches to testing, measurement, and/or specification regarding degree, at least with respect to the property, continuing with the example, is reasonably likely to occur to one of ordinary skill, at least for implementation purposes, claimed subject matter is intended to cover those alternatively reasonable approaches unless otherwise expressly indicated. As an example, if a plot of measurements over a region is produced and implementation of claimed subject matter refers to employing a measurement of slope over the region, but a variety of reasonable and alternative techniques to estimate the slope over that region exist, claimed subject matter is intended to cover those reasonable alternative techniques unless otherwise expressly indicated.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">To the extent claimed subject matter is related to one or more particular measurements, such as with regard to physical manifestations capable of being measured physically, such as, without limit, temperature, pressure, voltage, current, electromagnetic radiation, etc., it is believed that claimed subject matter does not fall within the abstract idea judicial exception to statutory subject matter. Rather, it is asserted, that physical measurements are not mental steps and, likewise, are not abstract ideas.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">It is noted, nonetheless, that a typical measurement model employed is that one or more measurements may respectively comprise a sum of at least two components. Thus, for a given measurement, for example, one component may comprise a deterministic component, which in an ideal sense, may comprise a physical value (e.g., sought via one or more measurements), often in the form of one or more signals, signal samples and/or states, and one component may comprise a random component, which may have a variety of sources that may be challenging to quantify. At times, for example, lack of measurement precision may affect a given measurement. Thus, for claimed subject matter, a statistical or stochastic model may be used in addition to a deterministic model as an approach to identification and/or prediction regarding one or more measurement values that may relate to claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">For example, a relatively large number of measurements may be collected to better estimate a deterministic component. Likewise, if measurements vary, which may typically occur, it may be that some portion of a variance may be explained as a deterministic component, while some portion of a variance may be explained as a random component. Typically, it is desirable to have stochastic variance associated with measurements be relatively small, if feasible. That is, typically, it may be preferable to be able to account for a reasonable portion of measurement variation in a deterministic manner, rather than a stochastic matter as an aid to identification and/or predictability.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Along these lines, a variety of techniques have come into use so that one or more measurements may be processed to better estimate an underlying deterministic component, as well as to estimate potentially random components. These techniques, of course, may vary with details surrounding a given situation. Typically, however, more complex problems may involve use of more complex techniques. In this regard, as alluded to above, one or more measurements of physical manifestations may be modelled deterministically and/or stochastically. Employing a model permits collected measurements to potentially be identified and/or processed, and/or potentially permits estimation and/or prediction of an underlying deterministic component, for example, with respect to later measurements to be taken. A given estimate may not be a perfect estimate; however, in general, it is expected that on average one or more estimates may better reflect an underlying deterministic component, for example, if random components that may be included in one or more obtained measurements, are considered. Practically speaking, of course, it is desirable to be able to generate, such as through estimation approaches, a physically meaningful model of processes affecting measurements to be taken.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In some situations, however, as indicated, potential influences may be complex. Therefore, seeking to understand appropriate factors to consider may be particularly challenging. In such situations, it is, therefore, not unusual to employ heuristics with respect to generating one or more estimates. Heuristics refers to use of experience related approaches that may reflect realized processes and/or realized results, such as with respect to use of historical measurements, for example. Heuristics, for example, may be employed in situations where more analytical approaches may be overly complex and/or nearly intractable. Thus, regarding claimed subject matter, an innovative feature may include, in an example embodiment, heuristics that may be employed, for example, to estimate and/or predict one or more measurements.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">A &#x201c;signal measurement&#x201d; and/or a &#x201c;signal measurement vector&#x201d; may be referred to respectively as a &#x201c;random measurement&#x201d; and/or a &#x201c;random vector,&#x201d; such that the term &#x201c;random&#x201d; may be understood in context with respect to the fields of probability, random variables and/or stochastic processes. A random vector may be generated by having measurement signal components comprising one or more random variables. Random variables may comprise signal value measurements, which may, for example, be specified in a space of outcomes. Thus, in some contexts, a probability (e.g., likelihood) may be assigned to outcomes, as often may be used in connection with approaches employing probability and/or statistics. In other contexts, a random variable may be substantially in accordance with a measurement comprising a deterministic measurement value or, perhaps, an average measurement component plus random variation about a measurement average. The terms &#x201c;measurement vector,&#x201d; &#x201c;random vector,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;vector&#x201d; are used throughout this document interchangeably. In an embodiment, a random vector, or portion thereof, comprising one or more measurement vectors may uniquely be associated with a distribution of scalar numerical values, such as random scalar numerical values (e.g., signal values and/or signal sample values), for example. Thus, it is understood, of course, that a distribution of scalar numerical values, for example, without loss of generality, substantially in accordance with the foregoing description and/or later description, is related to physical measurements, and is likewise understood to exist as physical signals and/or physical signal samples.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">The terms &#x201c;correspond&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference&#x201d;, &#x201c;associate&#x201d;, and/or similar terms relate to signals, signal samples and/or states, e.g., components of a signal measurement vector, which may be stored in memory and/or employed with operations to generate results, depending, at least in part, on the above-mentioned, signal samples and/or signal sample states. For example, a signal sample measurement vector may be stored in a memory location and further referenced wherein such a reference may be embodied and/or described as a stored relationship. A stored relationship may be employed by associating (e.g., relating) one or more memory addresses to one or more another memory addresses, for example, and may facilitate an operation, involving, at least in part, a combination of signal samples and/or states stored in memory, such as for processing by a processor and/or similar device, for example. Thus, in a particular context, &#x201c;associating,&#x201d; &#x201c;referencing,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;corresponding&#x201d; may, for example, refer to an executable process of accessing memory contents of two or more memory locations, e.g., to facilitate execution of one or more operations among signal samples and/or states, wherein one or more results of the one or more operations may likewise be employed for additional processing, such as in other operations, or may be stored in the same or other memory locations, as may, for example, be directed by executable instructions. Furthermore, terms &#x201c;fetching&#x201d; and &#x201c;reading&#x201d; or &#x201c;storing&#x201d; and &#x201c;writing&#x201d; are to be understood as interchangeable terms for the respective operations, e.g., a result may be fetched (or read) from a memory location; likewise, a result may be stored in (or written to) a memory location.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">It is further noted that the terms &#x201c;type&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;like,&#x201d; if used, such as with a feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like, using &#x201c;optical&#x201d; or &#x201c;electrical&#x201d; as simple examples, means at least partially of and/or relating to the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like in such a way that presence of minor variations, even variations that might otherwise not be considered fully consistent with the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like, do not in general prevent the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like from being of a &#x201c;type&#x201d; and/or being &#x201c;like,&#x201d; (such as being an &#x201c;optical-type&#x201d; or being &#x201c;optical-like,&#x201d; for example) if the minor variations are sufficiently minor so that the feature, structure, characteristic, and/or the like would still be considered to be substantially present with such variations also present. Thus, continuing with this example, the terms optical-type and/or optical-like properties are necessarily intended to include optical properties. Likewise, the terms electrical-type and/or electrical-like properties, as another example, are necessarily intended to include electrical properties. It should be noted that the specification of the present patent application merely provides one or more illustrative examples and claimed subject matter is intended to not be limited to one or more illustrative examples; however, again, as has always been the case with respect to the specification of a patent application, particular context of description and/or usage provides helpful guidance regarding reasonable inferences to be drawn.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">With advances in technology, it has become more typical to employ distributed computing and/or communication approaches in which portions of a process, such as signal processing of signal samples, for example, may be allocated among various devices, including one or more client devices and/or one or more server devices, via a computing and/or communications network, for example. A network may comprise two or more devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, and/or may couple devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, so that signal communications, such as in the form of signal packets and/or signal frames (e.g., comprising one or more signal samples), for example, may be exchanged, such as between and/or among the one or more server devices and/or one or more client devices, as well as other types of devices, including between wired and/or wireless devices coupled via a wired and/or wireless network, for example.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">An example of a distributed computing system comprises the so-called Hadoop distributed computing system, which employs a map-reduce type of architecture. In the context of the present patent application, the terms map-reduce architecture and/or similar terms are intended to refer to a distributed computing system implementation and/or embodiment for processing and/or for generating larger sets of signal samples employing map and/or reduce operations for a parallel, distributed process performed over a network of devices. A map operation and/or similar terms refer to processing of signals (e.g., signal samples) to generate one or more key-value pairs and to distribute the one or more pairs to one or more devices of the system (e.g., network). A reduce operation and/or similar terms refer to processing of signals (e.g., signal samples) via a summary operation (e.g., such as counting the number of students in a queue, yielding name frequencies, etc.). A system may employ such an architecture, such as by marshaling distributed server devices, executing various tasks in parallel, and/or managing communications, such as signal transfers, between various parts of the system (e.g., network), in an embodiment. As mentioned, one non-limiting, but well-known, example comprises the Hadoop distributed computing system. It refers to an open source implementation and/or embodiment of a map-reduce type architecture (available from the Apache Software Foundation, 1901 Munsey Drive, Forrest Hill, Md., 21050-2747), but may include other aspects, such as the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) (available from the Apache Software Foundation, 1901 Munsey Drive, Forrest Hill, Md., 21050-2747). In general, therefore, &#x201c;Hadoop&#x201d; and/or similar terms (e.g., &#x201c;Hadoop-type,&#x201d; etc.) refer to an implementation and/or embodiment of a scheduler for executing larger processing jobs using a map-reduce architecture over a distributed system. Furthermore, in the context of the present patent application, use of the term &#x201c;Hadoop&#x201d; is intended to include versions, presently known and/or to be later developed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In the context of the present patent application, the term network device refers to any device capable of communicating via and/or as part of a network and may comprise a computing device. While network devices may be capable of communicating signals (e.g., signal packets and/or frames), such as via a wired and/or wireless network, they may also be capable of performing operations associated with a computing device, such as arithmetic and/or logic operations, processing and/or storing operations (e.g., storing signal samples), such as in memory as tangible, physical memory states, and/or may, for example, operate as a server device and/or a client device in various embodiments. Network devices capable of operating as a server device, a client device and/or otherwise, may include, as examples, dedicated rack-mounted servers, desktop computers, laptop computers, set top boxes, tablets, netbooks, smart phones, wearable devices, integrated devices combining two or more features of the foregoing devices, and/or the like, or any combination thereof. As mentioned, signal packets and/or frames, for example, may be exchanged, such as between a server device and/or a client device, as well as other types of devices, including between wired and/or wireless devices coupled via a wired and/or wireless network, for example, or any combination thereof. It is noted that the terms, server, server device, server computing device, server computing platform and/or similar terms are used interchangeably. Similarly, the terms client, client device, client computing device, client computing platform and/or similar terms are also used interchangeably. While in some instances, for ease of description, these terms may be used in the singular, such as by referring to a &#x201c;client device&#x201d; or a &#x201c;server device,&#x201d; the description is intended to encompass one or more client devices and/or one or more server devices, as appropriate. Along similar lines, references to a &#x201c;database&#x201d; are understood to mean, one or more databases and/or portions thereof, as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">It should be understood that for ease of description, a network device (also referred to as a networking device) may be embodied and/or described in terms of a computing device and vice-versa. However, it should further be understood that this description should in no way be construed so that claimed subject matter is limited to one embodiment, such as only a computing device and/or only a network device, but, instead, may be embodied as a variety of devices or combinations thereof, including, for example, one or more illustrative examples.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">A network may also include now known, and/or to be later developed arrangements, derivatives, and/or improvements, including, for example, past, present and/or future mass storage, such as network attached storage (NAS), a storage area network (SAN), and/or other forms of device readable media, for example. A network may include a portion of the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), wire-line type connections, wireless type connections, other connections, or any combination thereof. Thus, a network may be worldwide in scope and/or extent. Likewise, sub-networks, such as may employ differing architectures and/or may be substantially compliant and/or substantially compatible with differing protocols, such as network computing and/or communications protocols (e.g., network protocols), may interoperate within a larger network.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In the context of the present patent application, the term sub-network and/or similar terms, if used, for example, with respect to a network, refers to the network and/or a part thereof. Sub-networks may also comprise links, such as physical links, connecting and/or coupling nodes, so as to be capable to communicate signal packets and/or frames between devices of particular nodes, including via wired links, wireless links, or combinations thereof. Various types of devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, may be made available so that device interoperability is enabled and/or, in at least some instances, may be transparent. In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;transparent,&#x201d; if used with respect to devices of a network, refers to devices communicating via the network in which the devices are able to communicate via one or more intermediate devices, such as one or more intermediate nodes, but without the communicating devices necessarily specifying the one or more intermediate nodes and/or the one or more intermediate devices of the one or more intermediate nodes and/or, thus, may include within the network the devices communicating via the one or more intermediate nodes and/or the one or more intermediate devices of the one or more intermediate nodes, but may engage in signal communications as if such intermediate nodes and/or intermediate devices are not necessarily involved. For example, a router may provide a link and/or connection between otherwise separate and/or independent LANs.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In the context of the present patent application, a &#x201c;private network&#x201d; refers to a particular, limited set of devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, able to communicate with other devices, such as network devices and/or computing devices, in the particular, limited set, such as via signal packet and/or signal frame communications, for example, without a need for re-routing and/or redirecting signal communications. A private network may comprise a stand-alone network; however, a private network may also comprise a subset of a larger network, such as, for example, without limitation, all or a portion of the Internet. Thus, for example, a private network &#x201c;in the cloud&#x201d; may refer to a private network that comprises a subset of the Internet. Although signal packet and/or frame communications (e.g., signal communications) may employ intermediate devices of intermediate nodes to exchange signal packets and/or signal frames, those intermediate devices may not necessarily be included in the private network by not being a source or designated destination for one or more signal packets and/or signal frames, for example. It is understood in the context of the present patent application that a private network may direct outgoing signal communications to devices not in the private network, but devices outside the private network may not necessarily be able to direct inbound signal communications to devices included in the private network.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The Internet refers to a decentralized global network of interoperable networks that comply with the Internet Protocol (IP). It is noted that there are several versions of the Internet Protocol. The term Internet Protocol, IP, and/or similar terms are intended to refer to any version, now known and/or to be later developed. The Internet includes local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), wireless networks, and/or long haul public networks that, for example, may allow signal packets and/or frames to be communicated between LANs. The term World Wide Web (WWW or Web) and/or similar terms may also be used, although it refers to a part of the Internet that complies with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). For example, network devices may engage in an HTTP session through an exchange of appropriately substantially compatible and/or substantially compliant signal packets and/or frames. It is noted that there are several versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The term Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, and/or similar terms are intended to refer to any version, now known and/or to be later developed. It is likewise noted that in various places in this document substitution of the term Internet with the term World Wide Web (&#x201c;Web&#x201d;) may be made without a significant departure in meaning and may, therefore, also be understood in that manner if the statement would remain correct with such a substitution.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Although claimed subject matter is not in particular limited in scope to the Internet and/or to the Web; nonetheless, the Internet and/or the Web may without limitation provide a useful example of an embodiment at least for purposes of illustration. As indicated, the Internet and/or the Web may comprise a worldwide system of interoperable networks, including interoperable devices within those networks. The Internet and/or Web has evolved to a public, self-sustaining facility accessible to potentially billions of people or more worldwide. Also, in an embodiment, and as mentioned above, the terms &#x201c;WWW&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;Web&#x201d; refer to a part of the Internet that complies with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The Internet and/or the Web, therefore, in the context of the present patent application, may comprise a service that organizes stored digital content, such as, for example, text, images, video, etc., through the use of hypermedia, for example. It is noted that a network, such as the Internet and/or Web, may be employed to store electronic files and/or electronic documents.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">The term electronic file and/or the term electronic document are used throughout this document to refer to a set of stored memory states and/or a set of physical signals associated in a manner so as to, at least logically, form a file (e.g., electronic) and/or an electronic document. That is, it is not meant to implicitly reference a particular syntax, format and/or approach used, for example, with respect to a set of associated memory states and/or a set of associated physical signals. If a particular type of file storage format and/or syntax, for example, is intended, it is referenced expressly. It is further noted an association of memory states, for example, may be in a logical sense and not necessarily in a tangible, physical sense. Thus, although signal and/or state components of a file and/or an electronic document, for example, are to be associated logically, storage thereof, for example, may reside in one or more different places in a tangible, physical memory, in an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">A Hyper Text Markup Language (&#x201c;HTML&#x201d;), for example, may be utilized to specify digital content and/or to specify a format thereof, such as in the form of an electronic file and/or an electronic document, such as a Web page, Web site, etc., for example. An Extensible Markup Language (&#x201c;XML&#x201d;) may also be utilized to specify digital content and/or to specify a format thereof, such as in the form of an electronic file and/or an electronic document, such as a Web page, Web site, etc., in an embodiment. Of course, HTML and/or XML are merely examples of &#x201c;markup&#x201d; languages, provided as non-limiting illustrations. Furthermore, HTML and/or XML are intended to refer to any version, now known and/or to be later developed, of these languages. Likewise, claimed subject matter are not intended to be limited to examples provided as illustrations, of course.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;Web site&#x201d; and/or similar terms refer to Web pages that are associated electronically to form a particular collection thereof. Also, in the context of the present patent application, &#x201c;Web page&#x201d; and/or similar terms refer to an electronic file and/or an electronic document accessible via a network, including by specifying a uniform resource locator (URL) for accessibility via the Web, in an example embodiment. As alluded to above, in one or more embodiments, a Web page may comprise digital content coded (e.g., via computer instructions) using one or more languages, such as, for example, markup languages, including HTML and/or XML, although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect. Also, in one or more embodiments, application developers may write code (e.g., computer instructions) in the form of JavaScript (or other programming languages), for example, executable by a computing device to provide digital content to populate an electronic document and/or an electronic file in an appropriate format, such as for use in a particular application, for example. Use of the term &#x201c;JavaScript&#x201d; and/or similar terms intended to refer to one or more particular programming languages are intended to refer to any version of the one or more programming languages identified, now known and/or to be later developed. Thus, JavaScript is merely an example programming language. As was mentioned, claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited to examples and/or illustrations.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">In the context of the present patent application, the terms &#x201c;entry,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic entry,&#x201d; &#x201c;document,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic document,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d;, &#x201c;digital content,&#x201d; &#x201c;item,&#x201d; and/or similar terms are meant to refer to signals and/or states in a physical format, such as a digital signal and/or digital state format, e.g., that may be perceived by a user if displayed, played, tactilely generated, etc., and/or otherwise executed by a device, such as a digital device, including, for example, a computing device, but otherwise might not necessarily be readily perceivable by humans (e.g., if in a digital format). Likewise, in the context of the present patent application, digital content provided to a user in a form so that the user is able to readily perceive the underlying content itself (e.g., content presented in a form consumable by a human, such as hearing audio, feeling tactile sensations and/or seeing images, as examples) is referred to, with respect to the user, as &#x201c;consuming&#x201d; digital content, &#x201c;consumption&#x201d; of digital content, &#x201c;consumable&#x201d; digital content and/or similar terms. For one or more embodiments, an electronic document and/or an electronic file may comprise a Web page of code (e.g., computer instructions) in a markup language executed or to be executed by a computing and/or networking device, for example. In another embodiment, an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a portion and/or a region of a Web page. However, claimed subject matter is not intended to be limited in these respects.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Also, for one or more embodiments, an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a number of components. As previously indicated, in the context of the present patent application, a component is physical, but is not necessarily tangible. As an example, components with reference to an electronic document and/or electronic file, in one or more embodiments, may comprise text, for example, in the form of physical signals and/or physical states (e.g., capable of being physically displayed). Typically, memory states, for example, comprise tangible components, whereas physical signals are not necessarily tangible, although signals may become (e.g., be made) tangible, such as if appearing on a tangible display, for example, as is not uncommon. Also, for one or more embodiments, components with reference to an electronic document and/or electronic file may comprise a graphical object, such as, for example, an image, such as a digital image, and/or sub-objects, including attributes thereof, which, again, comprise physical signals and/or physical states (e.g., capable of being tangibly displayed). In an embodiment, digital content may comprise, for example, text, images, audio, video, and/or other types of electronic documents and/or electronic files, including portions thereof, for example.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Also, in the context of the present patent application, the term parameters (e.g., one or more parameters) refer to material descriptive of a collection of signal samples, such as one or more electronic documents and/or electronic files, and exist in the form of physical signals and/or physical states, such as memory states. For example, one or more parameters, such as referring to an electronic document and/or an electronic file comprising an image, may include, as examples, time of day at which an image was captured, latitude and longitude of an imaging sensor, such as a camera, for example, etc. In another example, one or more parameters relevant to digital content, such as digital content comprising a technical article, as an example, may include one or more authors, for example. Claimed subject matter is intended to embrace meaningful, descriptive parameters in any format, so long as the one or more parameters comprise physical signals and/or states, which may include, as parameter examples, collection name (e.g., electronic file and/or electronic document identifier name), technique of creation, purpose of creation, time and date of creation, logical path if stored, coding formats (e.g., type of computer instructions, such as a markup language) and/or standards and/or specifications used so as to be protocol compliant (e.g., meaning substantially compliant and/or substantially compatible) for one or more uses, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">Signal packet communications and/or signal frame communications, also referred to as signal packet transmissions and/or signal frame transmissions (or merely &#x201c;signal packets&#x201d; or &#x201c;signal frames&#x201d;), may be communicated between nodes of a network, where a node may comprise one or more network devices and/or one or more computing devices, for example. As an illustrative example, but without limitation, a node may comprise one or more sites employing a local network address, such as in a local network address space. Likewise, a device, such as a network device and/or a computing device, may be associated with that node. It is also noted that in the context of this patent application, the term &#x201c;transmission&#x201d; is intended as another term for a type of signal communication that may occur in any one of a variety of situations. Thus, it is not intended to imply a particular directionality of communication and/or a particular initiating end of a communication path for the &#x201c;transmission&#x201d; communication. For example, the mere use of the term in and of itself is not intended, in the context of the present patent application, to have particular implications with respect to the one or more signals being communicated, such as, for example, whether the signals are being communicated &#x201c;to&#x201d; a particular device, whether the signals are being communicated &#x201c;from&#x201d; a particular device, and/or regarding which end of a communication path may be initiating communication, such as, for example, in a &#x201c;push type&#x201d; of signal transfer or in a &#x201c;pull type&#x201d; of signal transfer. In the context of the present patent application, push and/or pull type signal transfers are distinguished by which end of a communications path initiates signal transfer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Thus, a signal packet and/or frame may, as an example, be communicated via a communication channel and/or a communication path, such as comprising a portion of the Internet and/or the Web, from a site via an access node coupled to the Internet or vice-versa. Likewise, a signal packet and/or frame may be forwarded via network nodes to a target site coupled to a local network, for example. A signal packet and/or frame communicated via the Internet and/or the Web, for example, may be routed via a path, such as either being &#x201c;pushed&#x201d; or &#x201c;pulled,&#x201d; comprising one or more gateways, servers, etc., that may, for example, route a signal packet and/or frame, such as, for example, substantially in accordance with a target and/or destination address and availability of a network path of network nodes to the target and/or destination address. Although the Internet and/or the Web comprise a network of interoperable networks, not all of those interoperable networks are necessarily available and/or accessible to the public.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In the context of the particular patent application, a network protocol, such as for communicating between and/or among devices of a network, may be characterized, at least in part, substantially in accordance with a layered description, such as the so-called Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) seven layer type of approach and/or description. A network computing and/or communications protocol (also referred to as a network protocol) refers to a set of signaling conventions, such as for communication transmissions, for example, as may take place between and/or among devices in a network. In the context of the present patent application, the term &#x201c;between&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood to include &#x201c;among&#x201d; if appropriate for the particular usage and vice-versa. Likewise, in the context of the present patent application, the terms &#x201c;compatible with,&#x201d; &#x201c;comply with&#x201d; and/or similar terms are understood to respectively include substantial compatibility and/or substantial compliance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">A network protocol, such as protocols characterized substantially in accordance with the aforementioned OSI description, has several layers. These layers are referred to as a network stack. Various types of communications (e.g., transmissions), such as network communications, may occur across various layers. The lowest level layer in a network stack, such as the so-called physical layer, may characterize how symbols (e.g., bits and/or bytes) are communicated as one or more signals (and/or signal samples) via a physical medium (e.g., twisted pair copper wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, wireless air interface, combinations thereof, etc.). Progressing to higher-level layers in a network protocol stack, additional operations and/or features may be available via engaging in communications that are substantially compatible and/or substantially compliant with a particular network protocol at these higher-level layers. For example, higher-level layers of a network protocol may, for example, affect device permissions, user permissions, etc.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">A network and/or sub-network, in an embodiment, may communicate via signal packets and/or signal frames, such as via participating digital devices and may be substantially compliant and/or substantially compatible with, but is not limited to, now known and/or to be developed, versions of any of the following network protocol stacks: ARCNET, AppleTalk, ATM, Bluetooth, DECnet, Ethernet, FDDI, Frame Relay, HIPPI, IEEE 1394, IEEE 802.11, IEEE-488, Internet Protocol Suite, IPX, Myrinet, OSI Protocol Suite, QsNet, RS-232, SPX, System Network Architecture, Token Ring, USB, and/or X.25. A network and/or sub-network may employ, for example, a version, now known and/or later to be developed, of the following: TCP/IP, UDP, DECnet, NetBEUI, IPX, AppleTalk and/or the like. Versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) may include IPv4, IPv6, and/or other later to be developed versions.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Regarding aspects related to a network, including a communications and/or computing network, a wireless network may couple devices, including client devices, with the network. A wireless network may employ stand-alone, ad-hoc networks, mesh networks, Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, cellular networks, and/or the like. A wireless network may further include a system of terminals, gateways, routers, and/or the like coupled by wireless radio links, and/or the like, which may move freely, randomly and/or organize themselves arbitrarily, such that network topology may change, at times even rapidly. A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies, including a version of Long Term Evolution (LTE), WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation (2G, 3G, 4G, or 5G) cellular technology and/or the like, whether currently known and/or to be later developed. Network access technologies may enable wide area coverage for devices, such as computing devices and/or network devices, with varying degrees of mobility, for example.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">A network may enable radio frequency and/or other wireless type communications via a wireless network access technology and/or air interface, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advanced, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, ultra-wideband (UWB), 802.11b/g/n, and/or the like. A wireless network may include virtually any type of now known and/or to be developed wireless communication mechanism and/or wireless communications protocol by which signals may be communicated between and/or among devices, between and/or among networks, within a network, and/or the like, including the foregoing, of course.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In the preceding description, various aspects of claimed subject matter have been described. For purposes of explanation, specifics, such as amounts, systems and/or configurations, as examples, were set forth. In other instances, well-known features were omitted and/or simplified so as not to obscure claimed subject matter. While certain features have been illustrated and/or described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and/or equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
