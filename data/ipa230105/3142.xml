An intake port through which steam is taken in from the outside is formed on an upstream side of the casing, and an exhaust port is formed on a downstream side thereof. After a flow direction and a velocity of high-temperature and high-pressure steam taken in from the intake port are adjusted at the turbine stator blade stage, the steam is converted into a rotational force of the shaft at the turbine rotor blade stage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The steam passing through the turbine loses energy from the upstream side to the downstream side, and the temperature (and pressure) thereof decreases. Therefore, in the turbine stator blade stage on the most downstream side, a portion of steam is condensed and exists in an air flow as fine water droplets, and a portion of the water droplets adheres to the surface of the turbine stator blade. These water droplets quickly grow on a blade surface to form a liquid film. The liquid film is constantly exposed to a high-speed steam flow around the liquid film, but when the liquid film grows further and becomes thicker, a portion of the liquid film is torn by the steam flow and scattered in the form of coarse droplets. The scattered droplets flow to the downstream side while gradually accelerating due to the steam flow. As a size of the droplet increases, a mass increases. Accordingly, it is difficult for the steam flow to accelerate to a steam velocity, and mainstream steam cannot pass between the turbine rotor blades and collides with the turbine rotor blades. Since a peripheral speed of the turbine rotor blade may exceed a speed of sound, when the scattered droplets collide with the turbine rotor blade, the droplets may erode the surface and generate erosion. In addition, the collision of droplets may hinder a rotation of the turbine rotor blade, resulting in braking loss.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various techniques have been proposed so far in order to prevent the adhesion and the growth of such droplets. For example, PTL 1 below describes a technique for removing moisture generated on a surface of a turbine nozzle (turbine stator blade) by heating the surface with an electric heating unit. PTL 1 also describes a technique for optimizing an amount of heating by the electric heating unit by measuring a thickness of a water film.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[PTL 1] Japanese Patent No. 5703082</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a velocity of a fluid flowing between turbine stator blades is high enough to reach 200 to 400 m/s as an example. A thickness of a water film is about several hundred microns. Therefore, in the technique described in PTL 1, a large error may occur in measurement of the thickness of the water film, and as a result, moisture may not be properly removed by an electric heating unit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure has been made to solve the above problems, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a steam turbine and blades having further improved performance.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the above problems, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a steam turbine including: a shaft that extends along a rotation axis; a plurality of rotor blades that extend in a radial direction from an outer peripheral surface of the shaft and that are arranged in a circumferential direction; a casing main body that covers the shaft and the rotor blade from an outer peripheral side; and a plurality of stator blades that extend in the radial direction from a position on an upstream side of the rotor blade on an inner peripheral surface of the casing main body and that are arranged in the circumferential direction, in which a plurality of water-repellent microgrooves extending in a steam flow direction are formed on a surface of at least one of the rotor blade and the stator blade.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide a steam turbine and a blade having further improved performance.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a steam turbine according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged view showing an internal configuration of the steam turbine according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view showing a configuration of a microgroove according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram showing dimensions of the microgroove according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a modification example of the microgroove according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a further modification example of the microgroove according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(Configuration of Steam Turbine)</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, a steam turbine <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>.

The stator blade <b>20</b> rectifies the flow of steam S, and the rectified mass of steam pushes the rotor blade <b>30</b> to give rotational force to the steam turbine rotor <b>1</b>. The rotational force of the steam turbine rotor <b>1</b> is taken out from a shaft end <b>11</b> and is used to drive an external device (generator or the like). As the steam turbine rotor <b>1</b> rotates, steam is discharged toward a subsequent device (condenser or the like) through a steam discharge pipe <b>13</b> on the downstream side.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although not shown in detail, the shaft <b>3</b> is rotatably supported inside the steam turbine casing <b>2</b> by a journal bearing and a thrust bearing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(Configuration of Stator Blade Main Body)</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, a configuration of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The stator blade main body <b>21</b> extends in the radial direction (radial direction with respect to the rotation axis O), which is a direction intersecting the flow direction. A cross section of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> seen from the radial direction has an airfoil shape. More specifically, a leading edge <b>21</b>F, which is an end edge on the upstream side in the flow direction, has a curved surface shape. A trailing edge <b>21</b>R, which is an end edge on the downstream side, has a tapered shape because a dimension in the circumferential direction is gradually reduced when viewed from the radial direction. From the leading edge <b>21</b>F to the trailing edge <b>21</b>R, the stator blade main body <b>21</b> is gently curved from one side in the circumferential direction with respect to the rotation axis O toward the other side. Further, the dimension of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> in the direction of the rotation axis O decreases toward an inner side in the radial direction. Of a pair of surfaces of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> facing the circumferential direction, the surface facing the upstream side is a pressure surface <b>21</b>P, and the surface facing the downstream side is a negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Of the pressure surface <b>21</b>P and the negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q, a plurality of microgrooves R are formed on at least the pressure surface <b>21</b>P. The microgroove R is recessed inward from the surface of the stator blade main body <b>21</b>. The microgrooves R extend in the steam flow direction Fm and are arranged in a direction intersecting the flow direction Fm. The &#x201c;flow direction Fm&#x201d; referred to here refers to the curved direction in which steam flows inside the steam turbine <b>100</b>, and is different for each stage of the stator blade <b>20</b> and the rotor blade <b>30</b>. It is desirable that such a &#x201c;flow direction Fm&#x201d; be measured and set based on, for example, numerical analysis or verification tests on an actual machine.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the present embodiment, the microgroove R has a triangular cross-sectional shape.

Further, it is desirable that a value of a height h from a bottom portion to the top t of the microgroove R is h=w/2. By setting the height h to such a value, a size of a water droplet can be controlled. Further, during machining, a cutting edge of a tool easily reaches a bottom surface of the microgroove R, and thus, both machining accuracy and manufacturing ease can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is desirable that a region where the microgroove R is formed is a region from the outer peripheral side where erosion of the rotor blade <b>30</b> is particularly problematic, that is, the radially outer end portion of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> to &#x2153; of the height of the stator blade. The microgroove R may be formed over the entire height of the stator blade.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is desirable that the microgroove R as described above is formed by applying laser processing to the surface of a metallic material constituting the stator blade main body <b>21</b>. Meanwhile, as long as a heat resistance requirement is satisfied, it is possible to adopt a configuration in which a film-like sheet having the microgroove R formed in advance is attached to the stator blade main body <b>21</b>. Due to the formation of such microgrooves R, the surface of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> has water repellency.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The outer peripheral ring <b>24</b> is attached to a radially outer end portion of the stator blade main body <b>21</b>.

The ring upstream surface <b>24</b>A and the ring downstream surface <b>24</b>C extend in the radial direction with respect to the rotation axis O. A radial dimension of the ring upstream surface <b>24</b>A is larger than a radial dimension of the ring downstream surface <b>24</b>C.

A film C having water repellency is formed on the surface of the microgroove R by the film forming substance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substance supply unit <b>5</b> has a storage portion <b>51</b>, a supply flow path <b>52</b>, and a discharge unit <b>53</b>. The storage portion <b>51</b> is a container for storing the film forming substance. The supply flow path <b>52</b> is a flow path formed inside the steam turbine casing <b>2</b>, and the film forming substance guided from the storage portion <b>51</b> flows through the supply flow path <b>52</b>. The supply flow path <b>52</b> extends in an annular shape centered on the rotation axis O. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the supply flow path <b>52</b> is formed only in the one-stage stator blade <b>20</b> (particularly, the final-stage stator blade <b>20</b>). However, the supply flow path <b>52</b> may be provided corresponding to the stator blades <b>20</b> of all stages.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an end portion of the supply flow path <b>52</b> penetrates the outer peripheral ring <b>24</b> in the radial direction and opens to the inner surface (ring inner peripheral surface <b>24</b>B) in the radial direction. The discharge unit <b>53</b> extends radially inward from this opening, and thus, extends to the inside of the stator blade main body <b>21</b>. The discharge unit <b>53</b> is a flow path that guides the film forming substance to the surface of the stator blade main body <b>21</b>. The discharge unit <b>53</b> extends radially from a radially outer end portion of the stator blade main body <b>21</b> to a length of &#x2153; of a blade height. It is also possible to adopt a configuration in which the supply flow path <b>52</b> extends over the entire area in a height direction of the blade.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The film forming substance pumped from the storage portion <b>51</b> by a pump or the like (not shown) is sprayed from an outlet E of the discharge unit <b>53</b> onto the pressure surface <b>21</b>P and the negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q through the supply flow path <b>52</b>. As a result, the film forming substance forms the water-repellent film C that covers at least the microgroove R. An amount of the film forming substance supplied is desirably 2 to several hundred ppm with respect to a flow rate of a water film formed by the condensation of steam on the pressure surface <b>21</b>P or on the negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">(Film Forming Substance)</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Specifically, as the film forming substance, a volatile amine compound (coating amine) having volatile properties, a surface-active action, and anticorrosion properties, and a volatile non-amine compound are preferably used. In forming the film C, instead of the configuration in which the film forming substance is normally supplied, a configuration in which a water-repellent coating is bonded on the pressure surface <b>21</b>P or on the negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q can be adopted. In this case, the film C can be easily and inexpensively formed by only applying the water-repellent coating to the blade <b>90</b>. This makes it possible to reduce manufacturing costs and man-hours.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">(Action Effect)</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the above configuration, the microgroove R is formed on the pressure surface <b>21</b>P and on the negative pressure surface <b>21</b>Q. As a result, water droplets condensed on the surface of the blade <b>90</b> are guided along the microgroove R toward the downstream side of the steam flow direction Fm. As a result, the probability of water droplets growing on the surface of the blade <b>90</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, since the microgroove R is covered with the film C, the water droplets do not grow in the microgroove R, and flow away as fine water droplets. As a result, generation of coarse water droplets can be suppressed, and the probability of erosion occurring in the other blades <b>90</b> on the downstream side can be reduced. Further, since a frictional resistance against the flow of steam is reduced, efficiency of the steam turbine <b>100</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, according to the above configuration, since the microgroove R has a triangular cross section, a contact area between the microgroove R and the water droplet is reduced, and the water droplet can be smoothly guided. Further, since the microgroove R has a simple shape, a cost required for machining can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, according to the above configuration, since the distance w between the tops t of the microgrooves R is less than 35 &#x3bc;m, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it is possible to prevent a water droplet Wd flowing along the microgrooves R from growing into a coarse water droplet having a diameter of 50 &#x3bc;m or more. Furthermore, the inventors have confirmed that a diameter d of the water droplet Wd can be limited to the same extent as the distance w when the microgroove has a groove shape in which a top is pointed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. That is, depending on the shape of the groove, an allowable value of the distance w is 50 &#x3bc;m. This makes it possible to further reduce the probability of erosion occurring in the blade <b>90</b> on the downstream side. Further, since the distance w is 1 &#x3bc;m or more, it is possible to prevent accuracy required for machining the microgroove R from becoming excessively high and to ensure the ease of manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, according to the above configuration, the film forming substance (FFS) is directly supplied to the surface of the blade <b>90</b> through the discharge unit <b>53</b>. As a result, the water-repellent film C is formed on the surface, and the adhesion probability of condensed water droplets can be reduced. Therefore, the generation of coarse water droplets caused by the growth of minute water droplets is suppressed, and the erosion caused by the collision of the coarse water droplets with the rotor blade <b>30</b> on the downstream side can be avoided. Further, since the film forming substance has a turbulent friction reducing effect (Toms effect), it is possible to improve a flow field of the fluid on the surface of the blade <b>90</b>. Further, since the film forming substance forms the film C on the metal surface, an anticorrosion effect can be obtained. In addition, since the film forming substance can be normally supplied by the substance supply unit <b>5</b>, it is possible to suppress the decrease in water repellency due to long-term use to a smaller extent as compared with the configuration in which the film C is formed by, for example, coating.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">OTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The embodiment of the present disclosure has been described above. It is possible to make various changes and modifications to the above configuration as long as it does not deviate from the gist of the present disclosure. For example, in the above embodiment, the configuration in which the microgroove R has a cross-sectional shape of a right-angled isosceles triangle has been described. However, the cross-sectional shape of the microgroove R is not limited to the above, and the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> can be adopted. As shown in these figures, the cross-sectional shape of the microgroove R is not limited to the right-angled isosceles triangle. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the microgroove Rb has a curved cross-sectional shape that is concave from the surface of the blade <b>90</b> and that is convex inwardly. According to this configuration, since an inclination near an apex is close to perpendicular to the surface of the blade <b>90</b>, the diameter of the water droplet can be suppressed to be smaller than that in the case of a triangular groove. That is, in a case where the vicinity of the apex is sharpened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when the distance w of the microgroove Rb is less than 50 &#x3bc;m, the water droplet Wd flowing along the microgroove R can be prevented from growing into a coarse water droplet having a diameter of 50 &#x3bc;m or more. This makes it possible to further reduce the probability of erosion occurring in the blade <b>90</b> on the downstream side.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a bottom surface P that spreads flat is formed between the microgrooves Rc.

In this case, it is conceivable that a flow path is formed inside the shaft <b>3</b> and a film forming substance is supplied from the flow path to the surface of the rotor blade <b>30</b>, or that coating is applied to the surface of the rotor blade <b>30</b>.
