For example, without limitation, the pump portions of the blood pumps herein may be sized and configured such that they can be introduced via a <b>1</b>OF introducer, while being able to achieve flow rates of at least 3.5 L/min when expanded and activated, which may be higher than some existing pump portions that are designed for placement in the descending aorta or vena cava.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Any of the blood pumps herein may include one or more anchors (which may also be referred to herein as stabilizing members) that are sized and configured to help stabilize a pump portion of the blood pump with respect to the descending aorta or IVC, examples of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. To anchor or stabilize as used in this context refers generally to being anchored in the aorta (or IVC) to prevent axial migration of the pump relative to the aorta, although some minimal movement may still occur, such as due to slight deformation of one or more anchors when the pump is in use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary pump portion <b>100</b> of a blood pump in an expanded configuration stabilized in place in descending aorta <b>150</b> and generally proximate to renal arteries <b>152</b>, with most or all of pump portion <b>100</b> upstream the renal arteries.

Pump portion <b>100</b> may include one or more anchors, and any of those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be optional. For example, the pump may only have one or more distal stabilizing members <b>120</b> extending from a distal end or distal region of the expandable blood conduit, as shown. It may be desirable to have anchors at one or more ends or end regions of the pump, such as anchors <b>120</b> and anchors <b>126</b>, and/or stabilizing members that are disposed axially between the fluid conduit ends, such as one or more of stabilizing members <b>122</b> or stabilizing members <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Any of the anchors or stabilizing members herein may comprise one or more materials such that the anchor is adapted to self-expand to an at least partially expanded configuration. For example, any of the anchors or stabilizing members herein may be adapted to self-expand after a sheath, and example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as sheath <b>130</b>, is retracted proximally to allow the anchor(s) to expand. Any of the anchors herein may be re-sheathed before or after final pump deployment and activation if pump repositioning is needed, or if the pump is to be re-sheathed and removed from the patient, such as with sheath <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Sheath <b>130</b> is adapted to be axially movable relative to the catheter and pump portions that are shown to deploy and sheath the expandable pump portion, which may be described in more detail in WO2018/226991A1, WO2019/094963 A1, WO2019/152875A1, WO2020/028537A1, WO2020/073047A1.

For example, stabilizing members <b>124</b> may be considered to have a general curved, C, U, or bow shape when expanded, and initially extend radially and distally relative to the blood conduit, then extend further proximally at their radially outer ends as shown. When the sheath is advanced distally, stabilizing members <b>124</b> are adapted to be collapse and be re-sheathed. Additionally, any of the anchors herein may extend solely radially outward when expanded and will be able to be collapsed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Any of the anchors herein may be separate components from the blood conduit (not unitary therewith), but may be secured to one or more other blood conduit components during manufacture. For example, any of the anchors herein may be secured to any portion of an expandable scaffold, examples of which are described in examples incorporated by reference herein. Anchors may optionally and alternatively be secured to and extend from a distal strut or a proximal strut of the expandable pump portion (not shown).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Anchors herein may be unitarily formed with one or more blood conduit components. For example, any of the anchors and scaffolds herein may be laser cut from the same nitinol tubular starting material. Forming the anchors unitarily with one or more blood conduit components may simplify construction by eliminating a step of coupling an anchor to a region of the blood conduit.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Any of the anchors herein may have distal free ends that are configured to further stabilize the anchor against tissue. For example, without limitation, any of the anchors herein may include an end that include one or more of barbs, protrusions, or any other type of element or configuration that is configured to increase the stability of the anchor with respect to the vessel wall, such as a descending aorta wall or IVC.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Any of the anchors herein may be equidistantly spaced apart around the shroud (circumferentially). For example, first and second anchors may be circumferentially spaced 180 degrees from each other, three anchors may be spaced 120 degrees from each other, four anchors may be spaced 90 degrees from each other, etc. In other embodiments, any of the anchors may not be circumferentially spaced equidistantly around the blood conduit.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows exemplary distal expandable and collapsible struts <b>110</b>, exemplary proximal expandable and collapsible struts <b>108</b>, exemplary distal impeller <b>104</b>, exemplary proximal impeller <b>106</b></p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Any of anchors herein may optionally be adapted to be inflatable, such as anchor <b>260</b>&#x2032; and <b>260</b>&#x2033; shown in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

Inflatable anchors <b>260</b>&#x2032; and <b>260</b>&#x2033;may be in fluid communication with inflation fluid in an inflation fluid source (not shown for clarity), which may be external to the patient. The pump portion in this embodiment has an inflatable anchor that comprises a distal inflatable anchor region <b>260</b>&#x2033; and a proximal inflatable anchor region <b>260</b>&#x2032;, which are in fluid communication in this example with each other via an inflation line <b>270</b>.

The inflation lumen may be in communication with an inflation fluid source, such as a gas source or a liquid source. One or more external pumps may help control the inflation of inflation fluid to the inflatable anchor(s). Inflation of the one or more inflatable anchors may occur at any time after the pump portion is deployed from a delivery sheath, such as sheath <b>220</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Any the inflatable anchors herein may be coupled to the expandable blood conduit using a wide variety to bonding concepts, such as spot welding or other techniques to couple inflatable members to an expandable blood conduit.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Any of the inflatable anchors herein may be configured to allow for some blood flow around the pump portion, before, during, and/or after operation of the pump. For example, any inflatable anchor herein may have an at least partially helical configuration when inflated, such as the anchor regions <b>260</b>&#x2032; and <b>260</b>&#x2033; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which can allow blood to continue to flow around the expandable blood conduit without the inflatable element completely occluding blood flow in the descending aorta or IVC. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows renal arteries <b>252</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Any of the inflatable anchors herein may be sized and configured such that when inflated and expanded with a fluid, they expand and engage the descending aorta wall <b>250</b> and help anchor the pump in place to minimize axial migration of the blood conduit during use.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The outer dimension of any of the pump portions herein may be varied as needed for the implantation and/or the placement location within the patient. For example, the pump portion may be sized such that in an expanded configuration, an outer surface (optionally cylindrical) of the blood conduit directly engages or substantially engages a descending aorta or IVC sufficiently to anchor the pump in place and sufficiently minimize movement. An exemplary pump that is sized and configured to be expanded and anchored against a descending aorta <b>350</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

The blood pump shown expanded in place in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> does not have a fluid conduit that extends all the way in between distal and proximal impellers, as shown. The pump portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes a distal pump portion <b>480</b> that includes an expandable scaffold or basket, and a proximal pump portion <b>490</b> that includes an expandable scaffold or basket, each of which at least partially surrounds an impeller (distal impeller <b>482</b> is labeled). In this embodiment, the impellers may be rotated by the same or an otherwise common drive mechanism <b>472</b> (e.g., a drive cable or drive shaft), which may be rotated by an external motor that is also in rotational communication with the impellers. The distal pump portion <b>480</b> includes a distal blood conduit with an inflow and an outflow as shown, and the proximal pump portion <b>490</b> includes a proximal blood conduit with an inflow and an outflow as shown. The blood conduits may each include a scaffold coupled to a membrane. The central region between the distal pump portion <b>480</b> and the distal pump portion <b>490</b> is open and does not include a blood conduit, which allows blood pumped by the distal pump portion <b>480</b> to perfuse the renal arteries, as shown by the outflow of the distal pump portion <b>480</b>. The proximal pump portion <b>490</b> pumps blood towards the lower region of the body, as shown. The distal pump portion <b>480</b> is shown positioned just upstream to the renal arteries <b>452</b>, but the proximal end of the distal blood conduit may also be substantially aligned with one or more renal arteries so the outflow aids to perfuse one or both renal arteries.

For example, a variation of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> includes one or more inflatable anchors, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to help anchor the pump portion in the descending aorta. Alternatively, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be sized such that outer surfaces (e.g., cylindrical surfaces) of one or both of pump portions <b>480</b> and <b>490</b> expand into direct contact with descending aorta tissue <b>450</b>, such as is the case in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

This may cause the outflow from the distal pump portion <b>480</b> to have more of a radial component than distal pump portions in which the distal impeller does not extend proximally beyond the proximal end of the blood conduit. This may help perfuse the renal arteries to a greater extent by directing more of the outflow from the distal pump portion radially outwards towards the ostia of the renal arteries.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a variation of the blood pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the proximal pump portion <b>490</b> may include an impeller that is adapted and configured such that when the impeller is rotated, the impeller causes the proximal pump portion <b>490</b> to pump blood in a retrograde direction opposite that of the normal flow of blood, which is upward or in a superior direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In this variation, the proximal pump portion <b>490</b>, when activated, pumps blood in a retrograde direction towards the ostia of the renal arteries rather than pumping blood downstream. In these variations, the impellers may be driven by a common drive mechanism <b>472</b> (e.g., a drive cable and/or drive shaft). In some methods of use, the operation of the impellers of this variation may be controlled in a manner related to the cardiac cycle of the heart. In some uses, for example, the impellers may be activated synchronously with the cardiac cycle. For example without limitation, the distal and proximal impellers can be turned on or activated during systole or a portion of systole (e.g., peak systole), and deactivated during diastole or a portion of diastole.
