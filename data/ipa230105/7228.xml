The field sequential display comprises a multi-viewpoint 3D display screen (such as: a multi-viewpoint naked eye 3D display screen), a light source device, a light source time sequence controller and a 3D processing device. The multi-viewpoint 3D display screen may comprise a plurality of composite pixels, wherein each composite pixel comprises a plurality of pixels. The quantity of the pixels contained in each composite pixel corresponds to that of viewpoints of the field sequential display. In some embodiments, the one-to-one corresponding relation exists between the pixels contained in each composite pixel and the viewpoints of the field sequential display.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light source device may be located at the back side of the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen and is used for providing colored lights for the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen, so as to render corresponding pixels of each composite pixel in the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen. The light source device may comprise a plurality of monochromatic light sources; and the plurality of monochromatic light sources may comprise different colors of monochromatic light sources. For example, the monochromatic light sources comprise red light sources (R light sources), green light sources (G light sources) and blue light sources (B light sources) and may form R-G-B light-emitting sequences or R-G-B-B-G-R light-emitting sequences. Or, for example, the monochromatic light sources comprise red light sources (R light sources), blue light sources (B light sources) and yellow light sources (Y light sources) and may form R-Y-Y-B light-emitting sequences. Or, for example, the monochromatic light sources comprise red light sources (R light sources), green light sources (G light sources), blue light sources (B light sources), yellow light sources (Y light sources) and cyan light sources (C light sources) and may form R-G-B-Y-C light-emitting sequences. In addition, those skilled in the art may further list other colors of monochromatic light sources and light-emitting sequences, which are not repeated here. In some embodiments, the light source device comprises compensatory light sources, such as orange light sources or white light sources.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The light source time sequence controller is configured to control the turn-on time and the turn-off time of at least part of monochromatic light sources in the light source device. For example, in the R-G-B light-emitting sequences, the light source time sequence controller is configured to turn on the R light sources, the G light sources and the B light sources sequentially according to the time sequence. By utilizing the characteristic that eyes cannot distinguish a single color switched fast, based on the color combination effect in the time direction (i.e., based on the additive color mixture of the time), monochromatic lights emitted by different colors of monochromatic light sources can be mixed in the eyes, so as to display color 3D images. Under the condition that the compensatory light sources exist, the light source time sequence controller is further configured to control the turn-on time and the turn-off time of the compensatory light sources.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The 3D processing device is in communication connection with the light source time sequence controller and the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen respectively and is configured to send a light source driving signal and a display screen driving signal respectively, so that the light source time sequence controller can switch and turn on the monochromatic light sources required in each time period in a time sequence manner, so as to render the corresponding pixels in each composite pixel in the multi-viewpoint 3D display screen.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> exemplarily shows a schematic diagram of an internal architecture of a field sequential display.
