Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to gene expression profiling to differentiate ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and patients that present with stroke like symptoms caused by atrial fibrillation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmia) which involves the two small, upper heart chambers (the atria). Heart beats in a normal heart begin after electricity generated in the atria by the sinoatrial node spreads through the heart and causes contraction of the heart muscle and pumping of blood. In AF, the regular electrical impulses of the sinoatrial node are replaced by disorganized, rapid electrical impulses which result in irregular heartbeat.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The risk of developing atrial fibrillation increases with age. That is, AF affects four percent of individuals in their 80s. An individual may spontaneously alternate between AF and a normal rhythm (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) or may continue with AF as the dominant cardiac rhythm without reversion to the normal rhythm (chronic atrial fibrillation). Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic, but may result in symptoms of palpitations, fainting, chest pain, or even heart failure. These symptoms are especially common when atrial fibrillation results in a heart rate, which is either too fast or too slow. In addition, the erratic motion of the atria leads to blood stagnation (stasis) which increases the risk of blood clots that may travel from the heart to the brain and other areas. Thus, AF is an important risk factor for stroke, the most feared complication of atrial fibrillation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The symptoms of atrial fibrillation may be treated with medications which slow the heart rate. Several medications as well as electrical cardioversion may be used to convert AF to a normal heart rhythm. Surgical and catheter-based therapies may also be used to prevent atrial fibrillation in certain individuals. People with AF are often given blood thinners such as warfarin to protect them from strokes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Treatment of atrial fibrillation is directed by two main objectives: (i) prevent temporary circulatory instability; (ii) prevent stroke. The most common methods for achieving the former includes rate and rhythm control, while anticoagulation is usually the desired method for the latter (Prystowsky E. N., Am J Cardiol; 85, 3D-11D (2000); van Walraven C, et al., Jama. 288, 2441-2448 (2002)). Common methods for rate control, i.e. for reducing heart rate to normal, include beta blockers (e.g., metotprolol), cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) and calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil). All these medications work by slowing down the generation of pulses from the atria, and the conduction from the atria to the ventricles. Other drugs commonly used include quinidine, flecamide, propafenone, disopyramide, sotalol and amiodarone. Rhythm control can be achieved by electrical cardioversion, i.e. by applying DC electrical shock, or by chemical cardioversion, using drugs such as amiodarione, propafenone and flecamide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preventive measures for stroke include anticoagulants, novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). Representative examples of anticoagulant agents are Dalteparin (e.g., Fragmin), Danaparoid (e.g., Orgaran), Enoxaparin (e.g., Lovenox), Heparin (various), Tinzaparin (e.g., Innohep), Warfarin (e.g., Coumadin). DOACs are oral medications that specifically inhibit factors IIa or Xa. They are also known as new oral anticoagulants NOACs or target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs). Some patients with lone atrial fibrillation are sometimes treated with aspirin or clopidogrel. There is evidence that aspirin and clopidogrel are effective when used together, but the combination is still inferior to warfarin (Connolly S., et al. Lancet; 367, 1903-1912 (2006)). (2) The new anticoagulant ximelagatran has been shown to prevent stroke with equal efficacy as warfarin, without the difficult monitoring process associated with warfarin and with possibly fewer adverse hemorrhagic events.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Stroke is a common and serious disease. Each year in the United States more than 600,000 individuals suffer a stroke and more than 160,000 die from stroke-related causes (Sacco, R. L. et al., Stroke 28, 1507-17 (1997)). Furthermore, over 300,000 individuals present with Transient Ischemic Attack, a mild form of stroke, every year in the US. In western countries stroke is the leading cause of severe disability and the third leading cause of death (Bonita, R, Lancet 339, 342-4 (1992)). The lifetime risk of those who reach the age of 40 exceeds 10%.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The clinical phenotype of stroke is complex but is broadly divided into ischemic (accounting for 80-90%) and hemorrhagic stroke (10-20%) (Caplan, L. R Caplan's Stroke: A Clinical Approach, 1-556 (Butterworth-Heinemann, 2000)). Ischemic stroke is further subdivided into large vessel occlusive disease (referred to here as carotid stroke), usually due to atherosclerotic involvement of the common and internal carotid arteries, small vessel occlusive disease, thought to be a non-atherosclerotic narrowing of small end-arteries within the brain, strokes of unknown causes (commonly referred to as cryptogenic or embolic strokes of unknown source (ESUS)), strokes of other known causes, and cardiogenic stroke due to blood clots arising from the heart usually on the background of atrial fibrillation or ischemic (atherosclerotic) heart disease (Adams, H. P., Jr. et al., Stroke 24, 35-41 (1993)).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">AF is an independent risk factor for stroke, increasing risk about 5-fold. The risk for stroke attributable to AF increases with age. AF is responsible for about 15-20% of all strokes. AF is also an independent risk factor for stroke recurrence and stroke severity. A recent report showed people who had AF and were not treated with anticoagulants had a 2.1-fold increase in risk for recurrent stroke and a 2.4 fold increase in risk for recurrent severe stroke. People who have stroke caused by AF have been reported as 2.23 times more likely to be bedridden compared to those who have strokes from other causes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is based, in part, on using gene expression profiling to distinguish patients who have suffered or are at risk of suffering atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from patients who have suffered or are at risk of suffering arterial (large vessel) stroke using a gene expression profiling. The gene expression profiles can be used to categorize, diagnose and treat stroke patients by cause based on a profile of differentially expressed genes. The present invention is based, in part, on the identification of a profile of differentially expressed genes useful to distinguish atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from arterial (large vessel) stroke and to predict etiology of stroke of unclear cause.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides biomarkers useful for differentiating stroke patients with atrial fibrillation from those with large artery stroke.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the present invention is the provision of an improved method for prognosis of an outcome or assessing the risk of a patient having suffered a stroke or a transient ischemic attack, comprising determining the level of expression of at least one biomarker in a sample of the patient.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention provides for methods of using gene expression profiling to distinguish patients who have suffered or are at risk of suffering atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from patients who have suffered or are at risk of suffering arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), a type of ischemic stroke with an unknown origin, defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides methods for diagnosing the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or a predisposition for experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke.

Heart beat in a normal heart starts after electricity generated in the atria by the sinoatrial node spreads through the heart and causes contraction of the heart muscle and pumping of the blood. In AF, the regular electrical impulses of the sinoatrial node are replaced by disorganized, rapid electrical impulses which result in irregular heartbeat. There is a lack of unity in the function of the contracting cells of the heart muscle. AF is often asymptomatic but may result in symptoms of palpitations, exercise intolerance, fainting, shortness of breadth, chest pain or even heart failure. The erratic motion of the atria leads to blood stagnation (stasis) which increases the risk of blood clots that may travel from the heart to the brain and cause a stroke.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">The term &#x201c;atrial fibrillation therapeutic agent&#x201d; refers to an agent that can be used to ameliorate or prevent symptoms associated with atrial fibrillation.

The backbone is composed of subunit backbone moieties supporting the purine a pyrimidine heterocyclic bases at positions which allow such hydrogen bonding. These backbone moieties are cyclic moieties of 5 to 7 atoms in size, linked together by phosphorous-containing linkage units of one to three atoms in length. In certain preferred embodiments, the antisense agent comprises an oligonucleotide molecule.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">&#x201c;Ischemia&#x201d; or &#x201c;ischemic event&#x201d; as used herein refers to diseases and disorders characterized by inadequate blood supply (i.e., circulation) to a local area due to blockage of the blood vessels to the area. Ischemia includes for example, strokes and transient ischemic attacks. Strokes include, e.g., ischemic stroke (including, but not limited to, cardioembolic strokes, atheroembolic or atherothrombotic strokes, i.e., strokes caused by atherosclerosis in the carotid, aorta, heart, and brain, small vessel strokes (i.e., atrial fibrillation in ischemic strokes), strokes caused by diseases of the vessel wall, i.e., vasculitis, strokes caused by infection, strokes caused by hematological disorders, strokes caused by migraines, and strokes caused by medications such as hormone therapy), hemorrhagic ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">The term &#x201c;small deep infarct&#x201d; or &#x201c;small deep infarction&#x201d; or &#x201c;SDI&#x201d; interchangeably refer to focal infarction of the brain due to an uncertain cause, including but not limited to, cardioembolic, atheroembolic, atherosclerotic disease of the parent artery or disease of the perforating artery.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">The term &#x201c;lacunar stroke&#x201d; or &#x201c;lacune&#x201d; interchangeably refer to focal infarction of the brain due to perforating branch occlusion from microatheroma or lipohyalinosis. Implicit in this definition of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke is that the: 1) infarction is not due to cardioembolic source; 2) infarction is not due to atherosclerotic disease of parent arteries; 3) infarction occurs in regions of the brain supplied by penetrating arteries, e.g., basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, corona radiata or pons; 4) atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke is oftentimes associated with the presence of hypertension, diabetes or other vascular risk factors; and 5) infarcts tend to be smaller, generally less than 50 mm in diameter. When the cause of stroke is uncertain or likely other than perforating artery disease, then the more general term&#x2014;small deep infarct&#x2014;is appropriate.

By definition, a TIA resolves within 24 hours, but most TIA symptoms resolve within 1 hour. If symptoms persist longer, then it is categorized as a stroke. Symptoms include temporary loss of vision (typically amaurosis fugax); difficulty speaking (aphasia); weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis); numbness or tingling (paresthesia), usually on one side of the body, and dizziness, lack of coordination or poor balance. The symptoms of a TIA usually last a few minutes and with resolution of most symptoms within 60 minutes. TIAs are &#x201c;warning strokes&#x201d; that produce stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage. Recognizing and treating TIAs can reduce the risk of a major stroke.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">The term &#x201c;outcome&#x201d; herein relates for instance to the survival of the patient after a defined time, e.g., after 5 days, 4 weeks, 3 months, 1 year or re-stroke or to a functional outcome. Most preferably the outcome 3 months after the stroke or TIA is predicted. The term &#x201c;functional outcome&#x201d; in the context of the present invention relates to the degree of severity of the disease, i.e. the state of health the patient after a defined time, e.g after 5 days, 4 weeks, 3 months, or 1 year, preferably with regard to the stroke or stroke-like symptoms. Most preferably the functional outcome 3 months after the stroke or TIA is predicted. It is preferred in the context of the present invention, that the functional outcome is determined as ranking or the degree of severity of the outcome.

The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98 (1994)). The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, and polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">The phrase &#x201c;stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acid, but to no other sequences. Stringent hybridization conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology&#x2014;Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, &#x201c;Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays&#x201d; (1993). Generally, stringent hybridization conditions are selected to be about 5-10&#xb0; C. lower than the thermal melting point for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength Ph. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, Ph, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent hybridization conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at Ph 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30&#xb0; C. for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60&#xb0; C. for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent hybridization conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal is at least two times background, optionally 10 times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42&#xb0; C., or, 5&#xd7;SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65&#xb0; C., with wash in 0.2&#xd7;SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0081">Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent hybridization conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides which they encode are substantially identical. This occurs, for example, when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases, the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. Exemplary &#x201c;moderately stringent hybridization conditions&#x201d; include a hybridization in a buffer of 40% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37&#xb0; C., and a wash in 1&#xd7;SSC at 45&#xb0; C. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0082">The terms &#x201c;isolated,&#x201d; &#x201c;purified,&#x201d; or &#x201c;biologically pure&#x201d; refer to material that is substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany it as found in its native state. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A protein that is the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel. Particularly, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 85% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, and most preferably at least 99% pure.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0083">The term &#x201c;heterologous&#x201d; when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).</p><p id="p-0075" num="0084">An &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; is a nucleic acid construct, generated recombinantly or synthetically, with a series of specified nucleic acid elements that permit transcription of a particular nucleic acid in a host cell.

Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, &#x3b1;-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. &#x201c;Amino acid analogs&#x201d; refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. &#x201c;Amino acid mimetics&#x201d; refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087">Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are &#x201c;silent variations,&#x201d; which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0089">As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a &#x201c;conservatively modified variant&#x201d; where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art.

When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters. For sequence comparison of nucleic acids and proteins to ischemia-associated nucleic acids and proteins, the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms and the default parameters discussed below are used.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">A &#x201c;comparison window&#x201d;, as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith &#x26; Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman &#x26; Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &#x26; Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al., eds. 1995 supplement)).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0103">A preferred example of algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1977) and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990), respectively. BLAST and BLAST 2.0 are used, with the parameters described herein, to determine percent sequence identity for the nucleic acids and proteins of the invention. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (on the internet at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff &#x26; Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin &#x26; Altschul, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">An indication that two nucleic acid sequences or polypeptides are substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid, as described below. Thus, a polypeptide is typically substantially identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each other under stringent conditions, as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the sequence.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">The phrase &#x201c;selectively (or specifically) hybridizes to&#x201d; refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (e.g., total cellular or library DNA or RNA).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0107">Introduction</p><p id="p-0099" num="0108">The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that gene expression profiles can distinguish stroke of atrial fibrillation etiology from arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0109">Accordingly, the present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that RNA expression profiling can be used to differentiate stroke of atrial fibrillation etiology from arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). The genes identified herein to be associated with the occurrence of and/or risk of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke find use to diagnose atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke based upon an RNA expression profile. The use of the presently identified gene allow for the use of a blood test for the rapid diagnosis of a cause of stroke.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0110">In practice, the level of expression of genes associated with the occurrence or risk of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke can be measured in the blood of patients with an ischemic stroke. The expression of these genes can be assessed using any applicable method in the art, including, e.g., RT-PCR, NGS, microarrays or other technology. In various embodiments, the expression of these target genes can be normalized to internal control genes, which are known in the art. A panel of control genes that are specific for ischemic stroke have been developed and are quite reliable. The endogenous control genes have fairly constant expression over many age groups, different diseases, and both genders. Once the RNA expression levels of the target genes (i.e., atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated genes) are measured, and the RNA levels of the control genes are measured, then the target gene expression is normalized to the control genes. The expression levels of the normalized target genes can then be applied to a linear discriminant analysis model to predict whether the blood sample is from a patient who has experience or is at risk of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke and the probability that this is the case.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0111">A blood test for the diagnosis of stroke is useful in several situations. For example, the gene expression panel can be used to predict whether atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke is the cause of stroke in patients. In particular, it is important to diagnose disease that would guide appropriate disease treatment and management including determining the most effective treatments for stroke.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0112">A diagnosis based on the expression levels of the presently identified atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated genes would guide appropriate treatment for stroke patients. The presently identified atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated genes further find use for diagnosing patients who have experienced or are at risk of experiencing Transient Ischemic Attacks. In these patients, the cause is often unknown. Thus, a blood test predicting the cause of the stroke could help prevent or ameliorate strokes in these patients.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0113">Biomarkers Useful for the Prediction or Diagnosis of Atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke, or for Distinguishing Atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0114">Biomarkers useful for the prediction, diagnosis or confirmation of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke, or for distinguishing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) (e.g., non-lacunar small deep infarct (SDI)) are selected from the group consisting of ELL2, GLIPR1, and MAPKAPK3. Determination of the expression levels of a plurality of the biomarkers of can be performed for the prediction, diagnosis or confirmation of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke in conjunction with other biomarkers known in the art for the prediction, diagnosis or confirmation of the occurrence of ischemic stroke, SDI and/or atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke, in conjunction with biomarkers described herein and known in the art useful for determining the cause of ischemic stroke and/or in conjunction with methods known in the art for determining the cause of ischemic stroke.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0115">Determination of the expression levels of a plurality of the biomarkers can be performed for the prediction, diagnosis or confirmation of the occurrence of stroke can also be performed independently, e.g., to diagnose that an atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke has occurred, to distinguish atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke from arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) or non-lacunar SDI, or to determine the risk that a patient may suffer an atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0116">As appropriate, the expression levels of at least one or more biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ELL2, GLIPR1, and MAPKAPK3 are determined.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0117">In some embodiments, the level of expression of biomarkers indicative of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke is determined within 72 hours, for example, within 60, 48, 36, 24, 12, 6 or 3 hours of a suspected ischemic event. An increased expression level of one or more atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ELL2, GLIPR1, and MAPKAPK3, is correlative with or indicates that the patient suffers from or is at risk of developing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke. Conversely, a decreased expression level of one or more atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarkers selected from the group consisting of ELL2, GLIPR1, and MAPKAPK3 is correlative with or indicates that the patient suffers from or is at risk of developing arterial (large vessel) stroke or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0118">The overexpression or the underexpression of the biomarkers are determined with reference to a control level of expression. The control level of expression can be determined using any method known in the art. For example, the control level of expression can be from a population of individuals known to not have or be at risk for an ischemic event such as atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or can be determined with reference to a panel of stably expressed reference biomarkers. Also, threshold levels of expression can be determined based on levels of expression in predetermined populations (e.g., known to not have or be at risk for an ischemic event such as atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke versus known to have or be at risk for atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke). Overexpression or underexpression of a plurality of biomarkers that is at least about 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.8 fold, 1.9-fold, 2.0-fold, 2.1 fold, 2.2-fold, 2.3-fold, 2.4-fold, 2.5-fold, or more, in comparison to the expression levels of a plurality of stably expressed endogenous reference biomarkers, e.g., those listed in Table 1, is correlative with or indicates that the subject has experienced or is at risk of experiencing an atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Comparison to a Control Level of Expression</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0119">The expression levels of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarkers are compared to a control level of expression. As appropriate, the control level of expression can be the expression level of the same atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in an otherwise healthy individual (e.g., in an individual who has not experienced and/or is not at risk of experiencing a vascular event, e.g., TIA, ischemic stroke or a small deep infarct). In some embodiments, the control level of expression is the expression level of a plurality of stably expressed endogenous reference biomarkers, as described herein and/or known in the art. In some embodiments, the control level of expression is a predetermined threshold level of expression of the same atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker, e.g., based on the expression level of the biomarker in a population of otherwise healthy individuals. In some embodiments, the expression level of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in the test subject and the expression level of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in an otherwise healthy individual are normalized to (i.e., divided by), e.g., the expression levels of a plurality of stably expressed endogenous reference biomarkers.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0120">In some embodiments, the overexpression or underexpression of an atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke associated biomarker is determined with reference to the expression of the same atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke associated biomarker in an otherwise healthy individual. For example, a healthy or normal control individual has not experienced and/or is not at risk of experiencing ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack or a small deep infarction. The healthy or normal control individual generally has not experienced a vascular event (e.g., TIA, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, or venous thromboembolism) and does not have cerebral vascular disease. The healthy or normal control individual generally does not have one or more vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or tobacco smoking). As appropriate, the expression levels of the target atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in the healthy or normal control individual can be normalized (i.e., divided by) the expression levels of a plurality of stably expressed endogenous reference biomarkers.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0121">In some embodiments, the overexpression or underexpression of an atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke associated biomarker is determined with reference to one or more stably expressed endogenous reference biomarkers. Internal control biomarkers or endogenous reference biomarkers are expressed at the same or nearly the same expression levels in the blood of patients with stroke or TIAs or SDIs as compared to control patients. Target biomarkers are expressed at higher or lower levels in the blood of the stroke or TIA or SDI patients. The expression levels of the target biomarker to the reference biomarker are normalized by dividing the expression level of the target biomarker to the expression levels of a plurality of endogenous reference biomarkers. The normalized expression level of a target biomarker can be used to predict the occurrence or lack thereof of stroke or TIA or SDI, and/or the cause of stroke or TIA or SDI.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0122">In some embodiments, the expression level of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker from a patient suspected of having or experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke and from a control patient are normalized with respect to the expression levels of a plurality of stably expressed endogenous genes. The expression levels of the normalized expression of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker can be compared to the expression levels of the normalized expression of the same atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in a control patient. The determined fold change in expression=normalized expression of target biomarker in atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke patient/normalized expression of target biomarker in control patient. Overexpression or underexpression of the normalized atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke patient by at least about 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.8-fold, 1.9-fold, 2.0-fold, 2.1 fold, 2.2-fold, 2.3-fold, 2.4-fold, 2.5-fold, 2.6-fold, 2.7-fold, 2.8-fold, 2.9-fold, 3.0-fold, 3.1-fold, 3.2-fold, 3.3-fold, 3.4-fold or 3.5-fold, or more, in comparison to the expression levels of the normalized atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in a healthy control patient is correlative with or indicates that the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or SDI patient has experienced or is at risk of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0123">In some embodiments, the control level of expression is a predetermined threshold level. The threshold level can correspond to the level of expression of the same atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker in an otherwise healthy individual or a population of otherwise healthy individuals, optionally normalized to the expression levels of a plurality of endogenous reference biomarkers. After expression levels and normalized expression levels of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarkers are determined in a representative number of otherwise healthy individuals and individuals predisposed to experiencing SDI or atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke, normal and atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke expression levels of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarkers can be maintained in a database, allowing for determination of threshold expression levels indicative of the presence or absence of risk to experience atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke. If the predetermined threshold level of expression is with respect to a population of normal control patients, then overexpression or underexpression of the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke-associated biomarker (usually normalized) in the stroke patient by at least about 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.8-fold, 1.9-fold, 2.0-fold, 2.1 fold, 2.2-fold, 2.3-fold, 2.4-fold, 2.5-fold, 2.6-fold, 2.7-fold, 2.8-fold, 2.9-fold, 3.0-fold, 3.1-fold, 3.2-fold, 3.3-fold, 3.4-fold or 3.5-fold, or more, in comparison to the threshold level is correlative with or indicates that the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke patient has experienced or is at risk of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke. If the predetermined threshold level of expression is with respect to a population of patients known to have experienced atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or known to be at risk for experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke, then an expression level in the patient suspected of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke that is approximately equal to the threshold level (or overexpressed or underexpressed greater than the threshold level of expression), is correlative with or indicates that the atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke or SDI patient has experienced or is at risk of experiencing atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0124">With respect to the endogenous reference biomarkers used for comparison, preferably, Exemplary endogenous reference biomarkers that find use are listed in Table 1, below.

Thus, the methods depend on profiling genes whose expression in certain tissues is activated to a higher or lower level in an individual afflicted with a condition, for example, cancer, such as prostate cancer, relative to its expression in a non-cancerous tissues or in a control subject. Gene expression can be activated to a higher or lower level at different stages of the same conditions and a differentially expressed gene can be either activated or inhibited at the nucleic acid level or protein level, or may be subject to alternative splicing to result in a different polypeptide product. Such differences can be evidenced by a change in mRNA levels, surface expression, secretion or other partitioning of a polypeptide, for example. For the purpose of this disclosure, differential gene expression is considered to be present when there is at least about 1.1-fold, 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold, 1.7-fold, 1.8-fold, 1.9-fold, to two-fold.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0132">Differential signature gene expression can be identified, or confirmed using methods known in the art such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) and microarray analysis. In particular embodiments, differential signature gene expression can be identified, or confirmed using microarray techniques. Thus, the signature genes can be measured in either fresh or paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, using microarray technology. In this method, polynucleotide sequences of interest are plated, or arrayed, on a microchip substrate. The arrayed sequences are then hybridized with specific DNA probes from cells or tissues of interest. In a preferred embodiment the technology combines fiber optic bundles and beads that self-assemble into an array. Each fiber optic bundle contains thousands to millions of individual fibers depending on the diameter of the bundle. Sensors are affixed to each bead in a given batch. The particular molecules on a bead define that bead's function as a sensor. To form an array, fiber optic bundles are dipped into pools of coated beads. The coated beads are drawn into the wells, one bead per well, on the end of each fiber in the bundle. The present disclosure is not limited to the solid supports described above. Indeed, a variety of other solid supports are contemplated including, but not limited to, glass microscope slides, glass wafers, gold, silicon, microchips, and other plastic, metal, ceramic, or biological surfaces. Microarray analysis can be performed by commercially available equipment, following manufacturer's protocols, such as by using Illumina's technology.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0133">Exemplary arrays that are useful include, without limitation, a GeneChip&#xae; Human Transcriptome Array (HTA 2.0) and Clariom&#x2122; expression arrays available from ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., a Sentrix&#xae; Array or Sentrix&#xae; BeadChip Array available from Illumina&#xae;, Inc.

Exemplary formats that can be used in the disclosure to distinguish beads in a fluid sample using microfluidic devices are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,793. Commercially available fluid formats for distinguishing beads include, for example, those used in XMAP&#x2122; technologies from Luminex or MPSS&#x2122; methods from Lynx Therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0135">Further examples of commercially available microarrays that can be used in the disclosure include, for example, an Illumina microarray or other microarray synthesized in accordance with techniques sometimes referred to as massively parallel sequencing technology known as next generation sequencing (NGS). Next-generation sequencing methods include, for example, sequencing by synthesis technology (Illumina), pyrosequencing (454), ion semiconductor technology (Ion Torrent sequencing), single-molecule real-time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) and sequencing by ligation (SOLiD sequencing). In some embodiments, sequencing is massively parallel sequencing using sequencing-by-synthesis with reversible dye terminators. In other embodiments, sequencing is sequencing-by-ligation. In yet other embodiments, sequencing is single molecule sequencing. In still another embodiment, sequencing is paired-end sequencing. Optionally, an amplification step is performed prior to sequencing. As is known, complementary forward and reverse strands deriving from a single dsDNA molecule can be identified by their identical, or substantially identical unique sequence tags (i.e., barcodes or UMIs), and compared to identify, and correct for, amplification, library preparation, and sequencing based errors. In some embodiments, methods include analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for CNV detection using any one of several algorithms developed for each of the four broad methods for CNV detection using NGS, namely the depth of coverage (DOC), read-pair (RP), split-read (SR) and assembly-based (AS) methods. (Teo S. M., et al. Bioinformatics. 2012 Aug. 31). In some embodiments, methods include combining coverage with map information for the identification of deletions and duplications in targeted sequence data (Nord A. S., et al. BMC Genomics. 2011 Apr. 12; 12:184). As is well known in the art, various process in next generation sequencing can result in amplification, library preparation, and sequencing based errors. In some cases, complimentary forward and reverse sequences derived from a single dsDNA fragment can be matched based on identical, or substantially identical, unique sequence tags (i.e., barcodes or HMIs) and single nucleotide differences identified. In this manner, amplification, library preparation, and sequencing based errors can be identified and corrected.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0136">Further examples of commercially available microarrays that can be used in the disclosure include, for example, an ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.

In addition, as described below, the methods of the disclosure can be performed simultaneously and in parallel in a large number of tissue samples.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0145">The expression level of nucleic acid sequences corresponding to a set of signature genes in a tissue sample can be determined by contacting nucleic acid molecules derived from the tissue sample with a set of probes under conditions where complementary probes form a hybridization complex with the signature gene-specific nucleic acid sequences, each of the probes including at least two universal priming sites and a signature gene-specific nucleic acid sequence; amplifying the probes forming the hybridization complexes to produce amplicons; detecting the amplicons, wherein the detection of the amplicons indicates the presence of the nucleic acid sequences corresponding to the set of signature genes in the tissue sample; and determining the expression level of the target sequences, wherein the expression of at least two, at least three, at least five signature gene-specific sequences is detected.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0146">The presence of one, two or a plurality of nucleic acid sequences corresponding to a set of signature genes can be determined in a tissue sample using single, double or multiple probe configurations. The methods of the disclosure can be practiced with tissue samples having substantially degraded nucleic acids. Although methods for pre-qualifying samples with respect to nucleic acid degradation are described above, those skilled in the art will recognize that other detection methods described herein or known in the art can be used to detect RNA levels in a sample suspected of having degraded nucleic acids, thereby determine the level of nucleic acid degradation in accordance with the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0147">The present disclosure particularly draws on methodologies outlined in US 2003/0215821; US 2004/0018491; US 2003/0036064; US 2003/0211489, each of which is expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition, universal priming methods are described in detail in US 2002/0006617; US 2002/0132241, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. In addition, multiplex methods are described in detail US 2003/0211489; US 2003/0108900, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. In general, the methods of the disclosure can be performed in a variety of ways, as further described below and in the cited applications incorporated by reference. For example, mRNA signature samples can initially be subjected to a &#x201c;complexity reduction&#x201d; step, whereby the presence of a particular target is confirmed by adding probes that are enzymatically modified in the presence of the signature gene-specific nucleic acid sequence. The modified probes are then amplified and detected in a wide variety of ways. Preferred embodiments draw on multiplexing methods, which allow for the simultaneous detection of a number of nucleic acid sequences, for example, corresponding to a set of signature genes, as well as multiplexing amplification reactions, for example by using universal priming sequences to do multiplex PCR reactions. If desired, the initial step also can be both a complexity reduction and an amplification step.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0148">The randomly ordered BeadArray&#x2122; technology (Michael et al., Anal Chem 70, 1242-8 (1998); Walt, Science 287, 451-2 (2000)) has been developed at Illumina as a platform for SNP genotyping (Fan et al., Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol 68:69-78 (2003); Gunderson et al., Nat Genet 37:549-54 (2005)), gene expression profiling (Bibikova et al. Am J Pathol 165:1799-807 (2004); Fan et al., Genome Res 14:878-85 (2004); Kuhn et al., Genome Res 14:2347-56 (2004); Yeakley et al., Nat Biotechnol 20:353-8 (2002)) and DNA methylation detection (Bibikova et al., Genome Res 16:383-93 (2006)). Each array was assembled on an optical fiber bundle consisting of about 50,000 individual fibers fused together into a hexagonally packed matrix. The ends of the bundle were polished, and one end was chemically etched to create a microscopic well in each fiber. These wells were each filled with a 3-micron diameter silica bead. Each derivatized bead had several hundred thousand copies of a particular oligonucleotide covalently attached and available for hybridization. Bead libraries were prepared by conjugation of oligonucleotides to silica beads, followed by quantitative pooling together of the individual bead types. Because the beads were positioned randomly on the array, a decoding process was carried out to determine the location and identity of each bead in every array location (Gunderson et al., Genome Res 14: 870-7 (2004)). Each of the 1,624 bead types in the resulting universal array was present at an average redundancy of about 30. Consequently, each assay measurement was the result of data averaged from multiple beads, which increased precision and greatly reduced the possibility of error.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0149">To further increase sample throughput, the arrays were formatted into a matrix, in a pattern that matched the wells of standard 96-well microtiter plates. The matrix format allows streamlined sample handling. By bringing the array to the sample (literally dipping it into the microtiter well), sample and array processing is simplified and integrated for handling of 96 separate samples simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0150">A flexible, sensitive, accurate and cost-effective gene expression profiling assay, the DASL (for DNA-mediated annealing, selection, extension and ligation) assay, can be used for parallel analysis of thousands of sequence targets. In this assay in one embodiment, two oligos were designed to target a specific gene sequence. Total RNA was first converted to cDNA by random priming. The corresponding query oligos hybridized to the cDNA, and were extended and ligated enzymatically. The ligated products were then amplified and fluorescently labeled during PCR, and finally detected by binding to address sequences on the universal array. The hybridization intensity was used as a measurement of the original mRNA abundance in the sample.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0151">Unlike most of the other array technologies that use an in vitro transcription (IVT)-mediated sample labeling procedure (Phillips and Eberwine, Methods 10, 283-8 (1996)), DASL uses random priming in the cDNA synthesis, and therefore does not depend on an intact poly-A tail for T7-oligo-d(T) priming. In addition, the assay utilizes a relatively short target sequence of about 50 nucleotides for query oligonucleotide annealing, thus allowing microarray analyses of degraded RNAs (Bibikova et al., Am J Pathol 165:1799-807 (2004); Bibikova et al., Clin Chem 50:2384-6 (2004)).</p><p id="p-0144" num="0152">Software developed at Illumina can be used for automatic image registration (Galinsky, Bioinformatics 19:1832-6 (2003)) and extraction of feature intensities. Briefly, the feature extraction algorithm represents a weighted 6.times.6 average of pixel intensities. The outlier algorithm was implemented at the feature level (each probe sequence was represented by 30 features on average) to remove features that fell outside of a robust confidence interval of the median response. Array data can be normalized using the &#x201c;rank invariant&#x201d; method in Illumina's BeadStudio software.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Providing Appropriate Treatment and Prevention Regimes to Patient</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0153">Upon a positive determination or confirmation that a patient has experienced a stroke, and a determination of the cause of stroke, e.g., using the biomarkers provided herein, the methods further provide for the step of prescribing, providing or administering a regime for the prophylaxis or treatment of ischemic stroke or SDI.

The only patients for whom anticoagulation is not strongly recommended are those younger than 65 years old who are considered low-risk, i.e., they have no organic heart disease, no hypertension, no previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks and no diabetes. This group as a whole has a lower risk of stroke and stroke prevention with aspirin is generally recommended. For all other patients, anticoagulation is indicated whether the atrial fibrillation is permanent, recurrent paroxysmal or recurrent persistent. It cannot be generalized how patients who present with their first episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should be treated and the decision needs to be individualized for each patient. Anticoagulation is also indicated even when the patient with atrial fibrillation is felt to be maintained in sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic therapy (rhythm controlled) since this type of therapy does not affect stroke risk.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0169">Anticoagulation is recommended in atrial fibrillation, as detailed above, for prevention of cardioembolism and stroke. The most widely studied oral anticoagulant is warfarin and this medication is universally recommended for chronic oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Warfarin has few side effects aside from the risk of bleeding but requires regular and careful monitoring of blood values during therapy (to measure the effect of the anticoagulation). The oral anticoagulant ximelagatran showed promise in stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and had the advantage of not requiring regular monitoring like warfarin. Ximelagatran was found however to cause unexplained liver injury and was withdrawn from the market in 2006. Several agents are available for intravenous and/or subcutaneous therapy, including heparin and the low molecular weight heparins (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, ardeparin, nadroparin and reviparin). These medications are recommended when rapid initiation of anticoagulation is necessary or if oral anticoagulation therapy has to be interrupted in high risk patients or for longer than one week in other patients for example due to a series of procedures. Other parenteral anticoagulants are available but not specifically recommended as therapy in atrial fibrillation; e.g., the factor Xa inhibitors fondaparinux and idraparinux, the thrombin-inhibitors lepirudin, bivalirudin and argatroban as well as danaparoid.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0170">In another aspect, the pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more ASIC1a inhibitors further includes one or more anti-clotting agents.

Medical and surgical therapy applied to control symptoms of atrial fibrillation is tailored to the individual patient and consists of heart rate and/or rhythm control with medications, radiofrequency ablation and/or surgery.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0183">Antiarrhythmic medications. In general terms, antiarrhythmic agents are used to suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart that are characteristic of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. One classification of antiarrhythmic agents is the Vaughan Williams classification, in which five main categories of antiarrhythmic agents are defined. Class I agents are fast sodium channel blockers and are subclassified based on kinetics and strength of blockade as well as their effect on repolarization. Class Ia includes disopyramide, moricizine, procainamide and quinidine. Class Ib agents are lidocaine, mexiletine, tocamide, and phenyloin. Class Ic agents are encamide, flecamide, propafenone, ajmaline, cibenzoline and detajmium. Class II agents are beta blockers, they block the effects of catecholamines at beta-adrenergic receptors. Examples of beta blockers are esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, alprenolol, atenolol, carvedilol, bisoprolol, acebutolol, nadolol, pindolol, labetalol, oxprenotol, penbutolol, timolol, betaxolol, cartelol, sotalol and levobunolol. Class III agents have mixed properties but are collectively potassium channel blockers and prolong repolarization. Medications in this category are amiodarone, azimilide, bretylium, dofetilide, tedisamil, ibutilide, sematilide, sotalol, N-acetyl procainamide, nifekalant hydrochloride, vernakalant and ambasilide. Class IV agents are calcium channel blockers and include verapamil, mibefradil and diltiazem. Finally, class V consists of miscellaneous antiarrhythmics and includes digoxin and adenosine.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0184">Pharmacologic measures for maintenance of heart rate control include beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and digoxin. All these medications slow the electrical conduction through the atrioventricular node and slow the ventricular rate response to the rapid atrial fibrillation. Some antiarrhythmics used primarily for rhythm control (see below) also slow the atrioventricular node conduction rate and thus the ventricular heart rate response. These include some class III and Ic medications such as amiodarone, sotalol and flecamide.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0185">Cardioversion. Cardioversion of the heart rhythm from atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm can be achieved electrically, with synchronized direct-current cardioversion, or with medications such as ibutilide, amiodarone, procainamide, propafenone and flecamide.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Heart Rhythm Control</heading><p id="p-0178" num="0186">Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm (cardiac arrhythmia) which involves the two small, upper heart chambers (the atria). Heart beats in a normal heart begin after electricity generated in the atria by the sinoatrial node spreads through the heart and causes contraction of the heart muscle and pumping of blood. In AF, the regular electrical impulses of the sinoatrial node are replaced by disorganized, rapid electrical impulses, which result in irregular heartbeats. AF is an important risk factor for stroke, the most feared complication of atrial fibrillation.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0187">The symptoms of atrial fibrillation may be treated with medications which slow the heart rate. Several medications as well as electrical cardioversion may be used to convert AF to a normal heart rhythm. Surgical and catheter-based therapies may also be used to prevent atrial fibrillation in certain individuals. People with AF are often given blood thinners such as warfarin to protect them from strokes.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0188">Atrial fibrillation is usually accompanied by symptoms related to either rapid heart rate or embolization. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as palpitations, exercise intolerance, and occasionally produce angina and congestive symptoms of shortness of breath or edema. Sometimes the arrhythmia will be identified with the onset of a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is not uncommon to identify atrial fibrillation on a routine physical examination or electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), as it may be asymptomatic in some cases.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0189">Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is the episodic occurrence of the arrhythmia and may be difficult to diagnose. Episodes may occur with sleep or with exercise, and their episodic nature may require prolonged ECG monitoring (e.g., a Holter monitor) for diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0190">Atrial fibrillation is diagnosed on an electrocardiogram, an investigation performed routinely whenever irregular heartbeat is suspected. Characteristic findings include absence of P waves, unorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregularity of R-R interval due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles. If paroxysmal AF is suspected, episodes may be documented with the use of Holter monitoring (continuous ECG recording for 24 hours or longer).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0191">While many cases of AF have no definite cause, it may be the result of various other problems. Hence, renal function and electrolytes are routinely determined, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone (commonly suppressed in hyperthyroidism and of relevance if amiodarone is administered for treatment) and a blood count. A chest X-ray is generally performed. In acute-onset AF associated with chest pain, cardiac troponins, or other markers of damage to the heart muscle may be ordered. Coagulation studies (INR/aPTT) are usually performed, as anticoagulant medication may be commenced. A transesophageal echocardiogram may be indicated to identify any intracardiac thrombus.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0192">AF is linked to several cardiac causes, but may occur in otherwise normal hearts. Known associations include carbon monoxide poisoning, high blood pressure, mitral stenosis (e.g. due to rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse), mitral regurgitation, heart surgery, coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, excessive alcohol consumption (&#x201c;binge drinking&#x201d; or &#x201c;holiday heart syndrome&#x201d;), hyperthyroidism, hyperstimulation of the vagus nerve, usually by having large meals (&#x201c;binge eating&#x201d;), lung pathology (such as pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, Sarcoidosis), pericarditis, intense emotional turmoil, and congenital heart disease.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0193">The main goals of treatment of atrial fibrillation are to prevent temporary circulatory instability and to prevent stroke. Rate and rhythm control are principally used to achieve the former, while anticoagulation may be required to decrease the risk of the latter.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0194">AF can cause disabling and annoying symptoms. Palpitations, angina, lassitude (weariness), and decreased exercise tolerance are related to rapid heart rate and inefficient cardiac output caused by AF. There are two ways to approach these symptoms: rate control and rhythm control. Rate control treatments seek to reduce the heart rate to normal, usually 60 to 100 beats per minute. Rhythm control seeks to restore the normal heart rhythm, called normal sinus rhythm. Studies suggest that rhythm control is mainly a concern in newly diagnosed AF, while rate control is more important in the chronic phase.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0195">AF with a persistent rapid rate can cause a form of heart failure called tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. This can significantly increase mortality and morbidity. The early treatment of AF through either rate-control or rhythm-control can prevent this condition and thereby improve mortality and morbidity.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0196">Rate control methods include beta blockers (e.g., metoprolol), cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin), and calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil). These medications work by slowing the generation of impulses from the atria and the conduction of those impulse from the atria to the ventricles.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0197">In refractory cases where none of the above drugs are sufficient, a variety of other antiarrhythmic drugs, most commonly including quinidine, flecamide, propafenone, disopyramide, sotalol, or amiodarone may be used. Of these, only propafenone, sotalol, and amiodarone (which possess some beta blocking activity) control the ventricular rate; the others may maintain sinus rhythm, but may actually increase the ventricular rate. Many of these drugs are less frequently used today than in the past. All (with the possible exception of amiodarone) increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia, which can be fatal. In symptomatic patients with normal heart function, however, the small increase in risk is usually felt to be acceptable. In the presence of heart failure, the only antiarrhythmic drugs thought to be safe are amiodarone and dofetilide.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0198">In patients with AF where rate control drugs are ineffective and it is not possible to restore sinus rhythm using cardioversion, non-pharmacological alternatives are available. For example, to control rate it is possible to destroy the bundle of cells connecting the upper and lower chambers of the heart&#x2014;the atrioventricular node&#x2014;which regulates heart rate, and to implant a pacemaker instead. A more complex technique involves ablating groups of cells near the pulmonary veins where atrial fibrillation is thought to originate, or creating more extensive lesions in an attempt to prevent atrial fibrillation from establishing itself.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0199">Rhythm control methods include electrical and chemical cardioversion. Electrical cardioversion involves the restoration of normal heart rhythm through the application of a DC (direct current) electrical shock. Chemical cardioversion is performed with drugs, such as amiodarone, propafenone or flecamide. Implantable pacing devices can also be used for rate management of AF patients and can be indicated versus traditional cardioversion.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0200">The anti-arrhythmic medications often used in either pharmacological cardioversion or in the prevention of relapse to AF alter the flux of ions in heart tissue, making them less excitable, setting the stage for spontaneous and durable cardioversion. These medications are often used in concert with electrical cardioversion.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0201">Whichever method of cardioversion is used, approximately 50% of patients relapse within one year, although the continued daily use of oral antiarrhythmic drugs may extend this period. The key risk factor for relapse is duration of AF, although other risk factors that have been identified include the presence of structural heart disease, and increasing age.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0202">Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses radiofrequency energy to destroy abnormal electrical pathways in heart tissue. It is used in recurrent AF. The energy emitting probe (electrode) is placed into the heart through a catheter. The practitioner first &#x201c;maps&#x201d; an area of the heart to locate the abnormal electrical activity before the responsible tissue is eliminated. Ablation is a newer technique and has shown some promise for cases unresponsive to conventional treatments. New techniques include the use of cryoablation (tissue freezing using a coolant which flows through the catheter), and microwave ablation, where tissue is ablated by the microwave energy &#x201c;cooking&#x201d; the adjacent tissue. The abnormal electrophysiology can also be modified in a similar way surgically, and this procedure referred to as the Cox maze procedure, is commonly performed concomitantly with cardiac surgery. More recently, minimally invasive surgical variations on the Cox Maze procedure (&#x201c;minimaze&#x201d; procedures) have also been developed.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0203">The Cox maze procedure is an open-heart surgical procedure intended to eliminate atrial fibrillation. &#x201c;Maze&#x201d; refers to the series of incisions made in the atria (upper chambers of the heart), which are arranged in a maze-like pattern. The intention was to eliminate AF by using incisional scars to block abnormal electrical circuits (atrial macroreentry) that AF requires. This procedure required an extensive series of endocardial (from the inside of the heart) incisions through both atria, a median sternotomy (vertical incision through the breastbone) and cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). A series of improvements were made, culminating in 1992 in the Cox maze III procedure, which is now considered to be the &#x201c;gold standard&#x201d; for effective surgical cure of AF. The Cox maze III is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;traditional maze&#x201d;, the &#x201c;cut and sew maze&#x201d;, or simply the &#x201c;maze&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0204">Minimaze surgery is minimally invasive cardiac surgery intended to cure atrial fibrillation. Minimaze refers to &#x201c;mini&#x201d; versions of the original maze procedure. These procedures are less invasive than the Cox maze procedure and do not require a median sternotomy (vertical incision in the breastbone) or cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine). These procedures use microwave, radiofrequency, or acoustic energy to ablate atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0205">In confirmed AF, anticoagulant treatment is a crucial way to prevent stroke. Treatment of AF patients over age 60, who also have one or more of: previous strokes (or warning strokes), hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, or congestive heart failure, with warfarin (also known as COUMARIN or MAREVAN) results in a 60 to 70 percent reduction in the subsequent risk of stroke. Patients under age 65 who have any structural heart disease (i.e., valvular heart disease, ejection fraction &#x3c;=35%, history of heart attack) may also benefit from warfarin.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0206">The use of warfarin is associated with a delayed clinical effect. It typically takes three to five days to achieve a demonstrable anticoagulant effect. Hence, if an immediate anticoagulant effect is required, physicians could use heparin or other heparinoids such as enoxaparin to provide early anticoagulation. In practice, urgent anticoagulation is seldom indicated. Even in the setting of stroke complicating atrial fibrillation, clinical trial results do not support the routine use of immediate anticoagulation.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0207">Patients under age 65 who do not have structural heart disease (i.e., with LAF) do not require warfarin, and can be treated with aspirin or clopidogrel. There is evidence that aspirin and clopidogrel are effective when used together. The new anticoagulant ximelagatran has been shown to prevent stroke with equal efficacy as warfarin.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0208">Determining who should and should not receive anti-coagulation with anti-coagulant drugs (e.g., warfarin, ximelagatran, heparin or other heparinoids) is not easy. The CHADS2 score is the best validated method of determining risk of stroke (and therefore who should be anticoagulated). The UK NICE guidelines have instead opted for an algorithm approach. The underlying problem is that if a patient has a yearly risk of stroke that is less than 2%, then the risks associated with taking warfarin outweigh the risk of getting a stroke.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0209">The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 1.

Using the Biomarkers of Acute Stroke Etiology (BASE) trial (NCT02014896) dataset, our goal was to utilize a database of genes appearing in literature determine if gene expression accurately differentiate patients with atrial fibrillation from those with large artery stroke.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0211">Methods: BASE enrolled suspected stroke patients presenting to 20 hospitals within 24 hrs of symptom onset. Final gold standard diagnosis and stroke etiology were determined by an adjudication committee using all hospital data but blinded to RNA test results. Whole blood, obtained in PAXgene tubes, was frozen at &#x2212;20C within 72 hrs and analyzed at a core lab (Ischemia Care, LLC, Dayton, Ohio) using ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. HTA micro arrays. Genes were filtered to those appearing in stroke literature resulting in 543 potential signature genes. A two-way random forest classifier was built through cross validation of the training data resulting in a 3 gene diagnostic signature with robust performance conserved across literature consisting of ELL2, GLIPR1, MAPKAPK3 genes. Results: Overall, 99 patients were enrolled with NIHSS&#x3e;5, 68 (69%) with atrial fibrillation cause of stroke and 31 (31%) with large artery stroke; (48%) were male, and median (IQR) age was 74.4 (66.1, 81.7). Median (IQR) time from symptoms to blood collection was 420 (322, 472) minutes. Coexistent pathology at presentation included high blood pressure 84 (85%), hyperlipidemia 45 (45%), diabetes 31 (31%), and coronary artery disease 38 (38%). Three genes were able to differentiate atrial fibrillation from large vessel stroke; C-statistic 0.86 (0.52-1.0, 95% CI), sensitivity 0.93 (0.56-1.0, 95% CI) and specificity of 0.58 (0.35-0.81, 95% CI).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0212">Conclusion: RNA expression of ELL2, GLIPR1, MAPKAPK3 genes differentiates atrial fibrillation stroke patients from those with large artery stroke, and may have therapeutic and outcome implications.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0213">It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.
