Conventionally, fiber optic enclosures are used to provide a subscriber access point to the fiber optic network. The fiber-optic access network may include an optical line terminal (OLT) at a central office (CO) and a number of optical network terminals (ONTs), located at or near subscribers' premises (e.g., home, office building, etc.). Such fiber optic enclosure (ONT's) are connected to the fiber optic network through a subscriber cable connected to a network hub. However, the length of subscriber cable needed between the fiber optic enclosure and the network hub varies depending upon the location of the fiber optic enclosure with respect to the network hub. As a result, there is a need for a fiber optic enclosure that can effectively manage varying lengths of subscriber cable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional fiber optic enclosures include a spool of fiber optic cable provided on a plate that is mounted separately from the optical network terminal (ONT) and/or provided in the interior of a boxed enclosure that is also mounted in a region that is adjacent to and separate from the optical network terminal. When installing fiber optics from enclosure to enclosure, paying out cable from a spool can present a variety of issues. If a spool <b>112</b> is recessed within the interior of an enclosure <b>110</b> having a cover <b>116</b> (such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), access to the spool <b>112</b> becomes limited and cumbersome due to the walls <b>114</b>. Moreover, the enclosure <b>110</b> is generally mounted in a region that is adjacent to and separate from the ONT. On the other hand, if the spool is provided on a plate, the spool of excess cable is exposed to the environment and may be subject to tampering as well.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it may be desirable to provide a slack storage assembly configured to selectively provide access to slack fiber optic cable of an optical network terminal stored within a periphery of the optical network terminal. For example, it may be desirable to provide a skirt configured to block access to slack fiber optic cable wound on a cable spool when the skirt is coupled with the optical network terminal and to be removed from the optical network terminal to permit access to the slack fiber optic cable wound on the cable spool. In some aspects, it may be desirable to provide the skirt with a tab configured to prevent the slack storage cable from unwinding from the cable spool.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In example one embodiment of the present disclosure, a cable spool module for a terminal includes a skirt, a cable spool, and a retention member. The skirt includes a first lateral side and a second lateral side. The cable spool includes a barrel, an upper flange, and a lower flange that is configured to be mounted to a surface. The retention member is configured to couple a terminal to the cable spool.

The barrel and the upper flange are configured to be disposed between the lower flange and the terminal when the retention member couples the terminal to the cable spool and when the skirt is attached to the lower flange.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With respect to the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the skirt is configured to be movable between a storage state, where the skirt is removably attached to the lower flange and the optical terminal network, and a payout state, where the skirt is detached from the lower flange (and/or the mounting plate) and the optical terminal network. In the storage state, the skirt is configured to block access to the cable spool and slack fiber optic cable wound on the cable spool when the skirt is coupled with the lower flange and/or a mounting plate. In the payout state, the skirt is configured to permit access to the cable spool and the slack fiber optic cable wound on the cable spool to allow for payout of the slack fiber optic cable. The optical terminal network may be coupled to the skirt via retention member(s).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With respect to the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the cable spool is configured to distribute a cable to/from a lateral direction (when the skirt is not mounted onto one of the lower flange or the plate thereby allowing a user to have open access to the cable wound about the barrel of the cable spool and/or allowing a user to wind cable about the barrel of the cable spool in a fast and easy manner. However, the skirt, and the terminal are configured to enclose, protect and store the barrel, the cable spool and cable (that is wound about the barrel) when the skirt is mounted to an outer region of one of the lower flange or the plate and when the retention member couples the terminal to the cable spool.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this embodiment, the upper flange of the cable spool may be integral to a distal end of the barrel and a proximate end of the barrel may be integral to the lower flange. The skirt may be a flexible, elongated member having a first end and a second end wherein the second end is configured to be joined to the first end when the skirt is mounted to the outer region of the lower flange. The skirt may further includes a plurality of interior tabs configured to abut an upper surface of the upper flange when the skirt is mounted to the lower flange.

The secondary base portion may extend substantially perpendicularly away from the cable spool. The secondary distal portion is substantially perpendicular to the secondary base portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, in this embodiment, at least a portion of the second lateral side of the skirt may define a skirt overhang or protuberance that is configured to be interlocked with a flange overhang or protuberance that is defined in the outer or peripheral region of the lower flange.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another example embodiment of the present disclosure, a cable spool module may include a skirt, a plate, a cable spool, and a retention member.
