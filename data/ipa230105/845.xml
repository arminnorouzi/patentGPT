Fibrosis is a main contributor to organ dysfunction in a variety of diseases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">Cell damage and/or death, as a result of injury, usually triggers a restorative process, leading to the re-establishment of the original tissue architecture and functionality. However, chronic injury and in some cases even an acute injury, can lead to the development of fibrosis, loss of normal tissue architecture and loss of organ function. Fibrosis is recognized as a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, especially in diseases of the lung, liver, heart, kidney and skin (Nanthakumar et al., Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2015; 14(10):693-720). For the majority of fibrotic diseases there is currently no effective therapy available. Two drugs (nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor; and pirfenidone) were recently approved to treat patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and both compounds were shown to slow the rate of disease progression, although they do not offer a cure. Therefore, additional treatments modalities are urgently needed to treat patients with IPF, and other fibrotic diseases.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">During the past few years, a molecular understanding of potential genetic risk factors (Kaur et al., 2014) and mechanisms leading to IPF progression (McDonough et al, JCI Insight. 2019; 4(22). doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.131597; Reyfman et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2019; 199(12):1517-1536) emerged. Epithelial damage and subsequent infiltration of inflammatory cells triggers differentiation of resident fibroblast to a pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype that proliferates, resists apoptosis and secretes excess extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Tissue stiffening further stimulates mechanosensing myofibroblasts to create a self-amplifying pro-fibrotic status (Lv et al., Future Med Chem 2019; 11:2595-2620). Consequently, myofibroblasts are today considered the major cellular effector of the fibrotic response. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Hill et al., J Lung Health Dis. 2019; 3(2):31-35) and infiltrating fibrocytes (Chong et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2019; 116:105595) have been proposed to enlarge the pool of fibroblastic cells that can differentiate into a myofibroblast phenotype. Thus, targeting fibroblasts that are prone to differentiate into myofibroblasts or suppressing myofibroblast activity are emerging strategies to treat a progressing fibrotic disease.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">In IPF, epithelial injury triggers many different signals that contribute to the differentiation of fibroblasts to a myofibroblast phenotype, which is characterized by increased expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (&#x3b1;SMA), appearance of &#x3b1;SMA stress fibers, increased ECM protein secretory activity and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which further exacerbate the fibrotic condition. Amongst the known cytokines that trigger fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, TGF&#x3b2; and its downstream effectors are the most potent and most prominent fibrosis inducers, although other factors, including TNF&#x3b1;, PDGF&#x3b1;, IL-1, IL-6 and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), also contribute (Alsafadi et al., Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2017; 312(6):L896-L902; Peyser et al. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2019; 61(1):74-85; Distler et al., Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2019; 15:705-730).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The pro-fibrotic conditions and consequences on lung fibroblast phenotypes can be mimicked in vitro using exogenous stimuli such as TGF&#x3b1;, PDGF&#x3b1; or LPA on primary human lung fibroblasts and pharmacological interventions can be tested for efficacy. Based on the secretory activity and gene expression analysis, the in vitro-induced myofibroblast phenotype is in good agreement with the phenotype of IPF-derived (myo)fibroblasts in vivo (Weigle et al, J Biol Methods. 2019; 6(2):e115).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">The LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonist BMS-986020 (CAS Reg. No.: 1257213-50-5; WO2010/141761, WO2012/7078805, hereinafter also called Compound D) has been tested in a phase II clinical trial (NCT01766817) in IPF patients. Patients treated with BMS-986020 b.i.d. experienced a significantly slower rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) versus placebo. FVC is the total amount of air exhaled during the forced expiratory volume test that is measured during spirometry; and may be considered the most important measurement of lung function. Dose-related elevations in hepatic enzymes were observed in both BMS-986020 treatment groups. The study was terminated early because of three cases of cholecystitis that were determined to be related to BMS-986020 after unblinding.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Nintedanib ((3Z)-2,3-dihydro-3-[[[4-[methyl-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-acetyl]-amino]-phenyl]-amino]-phenylmethylene]-2-oxo-1H-indole-6-carboxylic acid methyl ester ethanesulfonate; see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,762,180, 7,119,093, 7,989,474, 9,907,756, 10,105,323, 10,154,990) is a triple kinase inhibitor that targets the receptor tyrosine kinases fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), which have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis and IPF. In two phase III trials, nintedanib reduced the decline in lung function by approximately 50% over one year. Nintedanib hard gelatine capsules contain for example nintedanib (150 mg or 100 mg), and the inactive ingredients medium-chain hard fat triglycerides, and soya lecithin (E322). It was approved by the US FDA in 2014 and in Europe in 2015. In the US, it is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Recommended dosage is 150 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) approximately 12 hours apart taken with food. Recommended dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A) is 100 mg b.i.d. approximately 12 hours apart taken with food. Temporary dose reduction to 100 mg, treatment interruption, or discontinuation for management of adverse reactions is to be considered, and prior to treatment initiation, liver function tests in all patients and a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential are recommended. Elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with nintedanib, including cases of drug-induced liver injury. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of drug-induced liver injury, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Further potential side effects of nintedanib are reported to include gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; embryo-fetal toxicity; arterial thromboembolic events; bleeding events; and gastrointestinal perforation. In the EU, nintedanib is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and it is further indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of adenocarcinoma tumour histology after first-line chemotherapy; wherein the recommended dose of nintedanib is 200 mg twice daily administered approximately 12 hours apart, on days 2 to 21 of a standard 21-day docetaxel treatment cycle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">According to www.clinicaltrials.gov, nintedanib is/has been tested in clinical trials directed to IPF in combination with pirfenidone; as well as in scleroderma related lung fibrosis; progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD); and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; and in several studies directed to cancer including for example thyroid cancer; non-small cell lung cancer; small cell lung cancer; esophagogastric cancer; malignant pleural mesothelioma that is recurrent; HER2-negative metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (MIBC); soft tissue sarcoma; advanced ovarian cancer; recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer; lung cancer; metastatic appendiceal carcinoma; endometrial cancer, pleural malignant mesothelioma; and refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone) is indicated for the treatment of IPF. Pirfenidone hard gelatine capsules contain pirfenidone (267 mg), and the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, and magnesium stearate. Pirfenidone film-coated tablets contain pirfenidone [267 mg (yellow) and 801 mg (brown)] and the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, povidone, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol (polyethylene glycol), talc, and iron oxide.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The recommended dosage of pirfenidone is 801 mg three times a day (t.i.d), corresponding to 2403 mg/day; wherein uptitration over 14 days starting from a 267 mg t.i.d. dose is recommended upon initation of treatment or after treatment interruption. Prior to treatment, conduction of liver function tests (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and bilirubin) is recommended.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with pirfenidone. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day in three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST&#x2265;3&#xd7;upper limit of normal (ULN) than placebo patients (3.7% vs 0.8%, respectively). Elevations&#x2265;10&#xd7;ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST&#x2265;3&#xd7;ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In consequence, temporary dosage reduction, treatment interruption, or discontinuation for management of adverse reactions such as DILI are recommended. Furthermore, dosage reduction or discontinuation may also be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash; as well as in some cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were more frequently reported by patients in the pirfenidone treatment groups than in those taking placebo. Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events was required in 18.5% of patients in the 2403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8% of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to 1.0% in the placebo group.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Several patents relate to pirfenidone, uses thereof, as well as to methods of mitigating certain of the above-mentioned liabilities (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,566,729, 7,635,707, 7,696,236, 7,767,225, 7,767,700, 7,816,383, 7,910,610, 7,988,994, 8,013,002, 8,084,475, 8,318,780, 8,383,150, 8,420,674, 8,592,462, 8,609,701, 8,648,098, 8,753,679, 8,754,109, 8,778,947). Pirfenidone has further been claimed to be useful in certain anti-fibrotic therapies in selected patients (WO2012/162592).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">According to www.clinicaltrials.gov, pirfenidone is/has been tested in clinical trials directed to rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), radiation-induced lung injury, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, progressive interstitial lung disease associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, pulmonary fibrosis with anti-myeloperoxydase (MPO) antibodies or pulmonary fibrosis with anti-MPO associated vasculitis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), progressive fibrotic sarcoidosis, advanced liver fibrosis, skin fibrosis in systemic sclerosis, interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis, and fibrosis caused by radiation therapy for cancer. In Mexico orally administered pirfenidone was approved for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis, and in form of a gel for the treatment of scars, fibrotic tissue and skin ulcers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Furthermore, development of fibrosis, especially of pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the possible sequelae of COVID-19, especially of moderate or severe COVID-19. In consequence, clinical trials were recently disclosed studying nintedanib and pirfenidone in the context of COVID-19, especially in post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (see for example NCT04607928, NCT04541680, NCT04338802, NCT04619680).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">In preclinical models, the general anti-fibrotic effect of pirfenidone has been widely established in animal models of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and hepatic fibrosis, as well as in Dupuytren's contracture. Pirfenidone demonstrated a consistent ability to reduce fibrosis and the expression of fibrogenic mediators.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">Nintedanib and pirfenidone were both tested for their anti-fibrotic activity in vitro, using primary human lung (myo)fibroblasts in various conditions (Atanelishvili et al, Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2019; 37 Suppl 119(4):115-124; Lehtonen et al., Respir Res. 2016; 17:14; Hostettler et al., Respir Res. 2014; 15:157). Both compounds attenuated, but usually did not fully inhibit, fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and/or the pro-fibrotic activity of (myo)fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that such an in vitro system is appropriate to evaluate compounds for anti-fibrotic activity, but also confirms that multiple signals and signaling pathways converge to induce a pro-fibrotic phenotype in these cells. It furthermore suggests that neither pirfenidone nor nintedanib might be able to reach a maximal effect even at high concentration.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In particular for pirfenidone, which is administered in humans at a high dose of three times 801 mg /day orally (total of 2403 mg/day), the concentrations that are used to observe significant effects (&#x3e;0.5 mM) in vitro are in line with the need for high compound exposures in humans. These findings highlight the need for additional treatments that can be used on top of currently available background therapy (i.e. pirfenidone and/or nintedanib, and optionally further background therapy) and which may, in combination, increase the efficacy of such anti-fibrotic therapy.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">It has now been found that LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists such as especially the compounds of formula (I) as defined below, which are LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists having potential in the prevention and treatment of fibrotic diseases and disorders (such as pulmonary fibrosis; renal fibrosis; gut fibrosis; liver fibrosis; head and neck fibrosis; corneal scarring; hypertrophic scarring and keloids; and other fibrotic diseases mentioned herein, including endometriosis, spinal cord fibrosis, myelofibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, perivascular fibrosis; formation of scar tissue, Peyronie's disease, abdominal or bowel adhesions, bladder fibrosis, fibrosis of the nasal passages, and fibrosis mediated by fibroblasts) may have complementary, and even synergistic effect when combined with pirfenidone in the treatment of such fibrotic diseases and disorders. Such combination may, thus, especially be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (especially IPF). Furthermore, the combination of an LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonist such as especially a compound of formula (I) with pirfenidone may allow for a dose reduction of pirfenidone, potentially even to dosages that are below established optimally efficacious dosages of pirfenidone when administered alone, thus, potentially mitigating certain safety liabilities associated with the high dose (2403 mg/day which is generally administered as 801 mg t.i.d.) of pirfenidone (for example the effect on liver enzymes, photosensitivity, rash, or gastro-intestinal side effects).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists such as especially the compounds of formula (I) as defined below may furthermore have at least complementary effect when combined with nintedanib in the treatment of such fibrotic diseases and disorders. The present LPA<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonists may in addition be combined with both pirfenidone and nintedanib in a triple combination prevention and/or treatment of such fibrotic diseases.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0001" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND A, pirfenidone, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND B, pirfenidone, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND C, pirfenidone, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND D, pirfenidone, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the dose-response of pirfenidone on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in NHLF in absence of COMPOUND A, and in presence of 10 nM, 100 nM and 1000 nM of COMPOUND A.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND A, nintedanib, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND B, nintedanib, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the effect of COMPOUND C, nintedanib, and their combination on TGF&#x3b2;-induced &#x3b1;SMA expression in human fibroblasts.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0039">1) A first embodiment relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as active principles, a compound of Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0037" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="30.40mm" wi="66.46mm" file="US20230000846A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0038" num="0000">wherein<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0040">X is CH; Y is N; and R<sup>2 </sup>is methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl (especially methyl); or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0041">X is N; Y is CH; and R<sup>2 </sup>is methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl (especially methyl), or difluoromethyl;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">R<sup>1 </sup>is fluoro, chloro, bromo, or methyl (especially chloro or methyl); and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">R<sup>3 </sup>represents<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0044">&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2-3</sub>&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;COOH (especially &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;COOH);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0045">&#x2014;CO&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-2</sub>&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;COOH (especially &#x2014;CO&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;COOH); or</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0046">&#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">in combination with one or more therapeutically active ingredients acting as anti-fibrotic agent(s); wherein said anti-fibrotic agent(s) is/are especially pirfenidone and/or nintedanib; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; as well as at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">The pharmaceutical composition according to embodiment 1) can be used as medicament, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical compositions for enteral (such especially oral) or parenteral administration (including topical application or inhalation).
