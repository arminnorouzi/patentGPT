In detail, the present disclosure relates to an electroluminescence display having superior color gamut (or color reproduction range) by blocking the current leakage, to solve the deterioration of color quality due to the current leakage between neighboring pixels as the distance between the neighboring pixels is closer as the pixel density is increased.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Discussion of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the advancement of information-oriented society, various requirements for display devices for displaying an image are increasing. Various display devices such as the liquid crystal display (or LCD) devices, the electroluminescence display devices and the quantum dot display (or QD) are being practically used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electroluminescence display, as a self-luminescence device, has characteristics of superior viewing angle and contrast ratio, of light weight and thin thickness without back light unit, and of low electric power consumption. In detail, the organic light emitting display among the electroluminescence display has merits where the driving is performed with a direct current and low voltage, a fast response time, and manufacturing cost is lower than other types of displays.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electroluminescence display includes a plurality of the light emitting diodes. The light emitting diode includes an anode electrode, a light emitting layer formed on the anode electrode, and a cathode electrode on the light emitting layer. As the high level voltage is applied to the anode electrode and the low level voltage is applied to the cathode electrode, the hole and the electron are moved to the light emitting layer from the anode electrode and the cathode electrode, respectively. The light emitting layer emits light as excitons are generated by the combination of electrons and holes and dropped from an exited state to a ground state. By controlling the amount of light generated at each of the light emitting layers of the light emitting diodes, the electroluminescence display represents the video data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to provide the high quality video images, the resolution of the display is getting higher and higher. For example, for the portable personal information device under 10 inch diagonal line of the display panel, it is required that the resolution would be enhanced to be over 300 PPI (Pixel Per Inch) up to 500 PPI. However, there are many problems for getting the ultra-high density resolution in the electroluminescence display. As the resolution is higher and higher, the distance between two neighboring light emitting diodes are getting closer so that the light for reproducing the video image may be distorted or deteriorated by the laterally leaked current from the neighboring light emitting diodes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve this problem, many methods or suggestions are provided. For the ultra-high density electroluminescence display, solutions are required for preventing the lateral leakage current between neighboring light emitting diodes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the present disclosure is directed to provide an electroluminescence display that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. For example, the present disclosure provides an electroluminescence display in which lateral leakage current between neighboring pixels is blocked and the driving power consumption is lowered, by increasing the concentration of the p-type impurity.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present disclosure is directed to provide an electroluminescence display comprising a first pixel defined for representing a first color on a substrate, a second pixel defined for representing a second color on the substrate, a first anode electrode at the first pixel, a second anode electrode at the second pixel, and a depletion electrode forming a depletion area between the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode. The depletion electrode is apart from the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode with a predetermined distance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the depletion electrode may have a width in a range of 30% to 60% of a gap between the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the depletion electrode may have a closed curve shape surrounding at least one of the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a width of the depletion electrode may have at least two different widths.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the depletion electrode may have a maximum width at a minimum area where a distance between the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode has a minimum value, and the depletion electrode may have a minimum width at other areas excepting the minimum area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the substrate may include a display area having the first pixel and the second pixel and a non-display area surrounding the display area. The depletion electrode may be connected to a line disposed at the non-display area for supplying a high level voltage.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the depletion electrode may receive a voltage equal to or higher than a voltage of the first anode electrode and a voltage of the second anode electrode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the electroluminescence display may further comprise a hole functional layer on the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode, an emission layer on the hole functional layer, an electron functional layer on the emission layer, and a cathode electrode on the electron functional layer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the hole functional layer and the electron functional layer may be commonly on the display area including the first pixel and the second pixel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the cathode electrode may be connected to a low level voltage line supplied with a low level voltage. The depletion electrode may be connected to a driving current line supplied with a high level voltage. The first anode electrode and the second anode electrode may be supplied with one voltage value in a range of the high level voltage and the low level voltage.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the emission layer may include a first emission layer overlapping with the first anode electrode, and a second emission layer overlapping with the second anode electrode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the hole functional layer may include a p-type impurity of 1.0% concentration at least.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the hole functional layer may include a hole injection layer on the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode, and a hole transport layer on the hole injection layer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the electron functional layer may include an electron transport layer on the emission layer, and an electron injection layer on the electron transport layer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the electroluminescence display may further comprise a third pixel defined for representing a third color light, close to at least one of the first pixel and the second pixel, and a third anode electrode at the third pixel. The depletion electrode may form the depletion areas between the first anode electrode and the third anode electrode, and between the second anode electrode and the third anode electrode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the first color, the second color and the third color may be different from each other.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, a first width of the depletion electrode at a minimum area where a distance between the first anode electrode and the second anode electrode has a minimum value may be larger than a second width of the depletion electrode at other areas excepting the minimum area.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additional advantages and features of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the disclosure. The objectives and other advantages of the disclosure may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings. According to the present disclosure, by adopting the depletion electrode for blocking the lateral leakage current between two neighboring subpixels, the best gamma quality can be ensured with the ultra-high density pixel resolution. Even though the concentration of the p-type impurities is increased, the lateral leakage current between two neighboring anode electrodes can be effectively blocked due to the depletion electrode. Therefore, the power consumption for driving the light emitting diode may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided an electroluminescence display including a depletion electrode between the anode electrodes. The depletion electrode is made of the same material as the anode electrode, so that there is no additional process step for forming the depletion electrode. Therefore, the manufacturing process is simple. The structure of the display can provide the superior video quality. By applying high level voltage to the depletion electrode used for driving the light emitting diode, the circuit for blocking the leakage current can be simply configured.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosure and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description serve to explain the principle of the disclosure.

It is required that the switching thin film transistor ST and the driving thin film transistor DT are prevented from any external influence. In addition, the surface of the substrate on which the thin film transistors ST and DT are formed is uneven, and has many step differences. In order for the organic light emitting diode EL to emit lights with superior efficiency, the organic light emitting layer should be formed on a smooth and flat surface. Therefore, it is preferable that a planarization layer PL is deposited over the whole surface of the substrate SUB in order for making the surface of the substrate SUB to be in smooth state and for protecting the elements. In other cases, a passivation layer may be further deposited under the planarization layer PL for covering the thin film transistors ST and DT.

The encapsulation layer ENC may cover the whole surface of the substrate SUB on the cathode electrode CAT. The encapsulation layer ENC may protect the thin film transistors ST and DT and the organic light emitting diode OLE from the external impacts. In addition, the encapsulation layer ENC may prevent from the moisture or the foreign materials being invaded into the organic light emitting diode OLE, so that it may keep the life time of the organic light emitting diode for a long time.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The organic light emitting layer EL may include a hole injection layer HIL, a hole transport layer HTL, an emission layer EML, an electron transport layer ETL and an electron injection layer EIL. The hole injection layer HIL, the hole transport layer HTL, the electron transport layer ETL and the electron injection layer EIL may be covered on the whole surface of the substrate SUB as to be commonly deposited on all or some of the organic light emitting diodes OLE. The organic light emitting layer EL excepting the emission layer EML are commonly deposited over some of the pixels, so that it may be deposited over the whole or some surfaces of the substrate SUB. Here, the hole injection layer HIL and the hole transport layer HTL are called as the hole functional layer for enhancing the mobility of the hole into the emission layer EML. Likely, the electron injection layer EIL and the electron transport layer ETL are called as the electron functional layer for enhancing the mobility of the electron into the emission layer EML.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the case that the organic light emitting layer EL emits a white color light, the emission layer EML may be disposed on the whole surface of the substrate SUB so as to be commonly deposited over all or some of the organic light emitting diode OLE.

In other cases, the color filters are further included for more enhancing the color gamut.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For the organic light emitting diode display, the thin film transistors ST and DT are formed on the substrate SUB and then the organic light emitting diode OLE is stacked thereon. According to the emission direction of the light from the organic light emitting diode OLE, the display may be categorized as the top emission type, the bottom emission type and the double emission type. For the top emission type, the light is emitted from the organic light emitting diode OLE to the encapsulation layer ENC disposed at upper side. For the bottom emission type, the light is emitted from the organic light emitting diode OLE to the substrate SUB disposed at lower side. For the double emission type, the light is emitted to the upper side and the lower side at the same time.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For the top emission type, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the anode electrode ANO has a transparent conductive layer and a high reflective metal layer under the transparent conductive layer.

In some cases, even though the opaque metal material is used, a very thin metal layer may ensure some degrees of transparency, so that the metal layer only may be used for the anode electrode ANO in the bottom emission type.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The anode electrode ANO is one electrode for supplying the hole. The hole injection layer HIL injects the hole received from the anode electrode ANO into the hole transport layer HTL.

Otherwise, when the combining area or the emission area where the electron and the hole are combined to generate the exciton is shifted from the middle area of the emission layer EML, the emission performance is not expected to have the best condition. That is, as the lights are not generated at the proper position of the emission layer EML, the correct color may not be emitted. In addition, the exciton generation may be occurred at the hole functional layer or the electron functional layer, so that the life time of the organic light emitting diode may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In order to generate the exciton within the emission layer EML, the hole and the electron should be transferred into the emission layer properly. To do so, the p-type impurity would be doped into the hole functional layers and the n-type impurity would be doped into the electron functional layers.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, by doping the p-type impurity with 1&#x2dc;1.2% into the hole injection layer HIL and/or the hole transport layer HTL, the hole mobility from the hole functional layer to the emission layer EL can be enhanced. In addition, by doping the n-type impurity with several % into the electron injection layer EIL and/or the electron transport layer ETL, the electron mobility from the electron functional layer to the emission layer EL can be enhanced. As the results, the power consumption may be lowered and the emission efficiency may be enhanced. Here, the doping % is the unit of volume amount of the impurity. For example, the doping % may be the volume % of the impurity to the volume of the host material.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one example, the hole functional layer may include the host material and the dopant material.

The additional p-type impurity doped hole functional layer may be a hole transport catalyst layer and the additional n-type impurity doped electron functional layer may be an electron transport catalyst layer.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">By doping the p-type impurity into the hole functional layer such as the hole injection layer HIL and/or the hole transport layer HTL, the light emitting layer may be enhanced, but it may cause any unexpected problem.

At the same time, the driving voltage of 0V is applied to the red anode electrode ANOR disposed in the red pixel R. The low level voltage of 0V is applied to the cathode electrode CAT. Therefore, there are voltage difference of 6V is applied between the green anode electrode ANOG and the cathode electrode CAT, so that the hole may move from the hole transport layer HTL close to the green anode electrode ANOG to the green emission layer ELG. At the same time, the electron may move from the electron transport layer ETL close to the cathode electrode CAT to the green emission layer ELG. At the green emission layer EGL, the hole and the electron are combined and the green color light is emitted out.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">On the contrary, there is no voltage difference between the red anode electrode ANOR disposed in the red pixel R and the cathode electrode CAT. A hole and an electron do not move to the red emission layer ELR. As a result, light is not emitted from the red emission layer ELR.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the case that the red pixel R and the green pixel G is very close as the pixel density is increased, the holes injected from the green anode electrode ANOG may move into the red pixel R neighboring the green pixel G due to the p-type impurities distributed in the hole transport layer HTL. As the results, a little amount of red lights may be emitted from the red emission layer ELR.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this case, even though the operation is designed to represent the pure green color light in one unit pixel, the pure green color light is not reproduced because that the red color light is emitted due to the leaked current. This problem may be severely occurred at the high resolution display in which the distance or gap between the neighboring anode electrodes ANO is very small or narrow.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The electroluminescence display according to the present disclosure further includes a depletion electrode DE between the anode electrodes ANO. The depletion electrode DE is supplied with a high-level voltage equal to or larger than the voltage applied to the anode electrode ANO. As a result, an electric field is formed between the depletion electrode DE and the cathode electrode CAT. According to this electric field, a depletion area is formed. The depletion area may be defined as an insulating region within a conductive, doped semiconductor material where the mobile charge carriers have been diffused away, or have been forced away by an electric field. Therefore, the hole, one of the conductive materials, cannot pass through this area, so that the lateral leakage current may be blocked.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the depletion area according to the present disclosure may include a depletion electrode DE, a bank BA, a hole injection layer HIL, a hole transport layer HTL, an electron transport layer ETL, an electron injection layer EIL and a cathode electrode CAT which are stacked sequentially. Here, the p-type impurity is doped into the hole injection layer HIL and/or the hole transport layer HTL, and the n-type impurity is doped into the electron injection layer EIL and/or the electron transport layer ETL. That is, these stacked materials may form a semiconductor structure having a formation in the PN junction of the p-type semiconductor material and the n-type semiconductor material.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Under the semiconductor having the formation in the PN junction, the depletion electrode DE is disposed with the bank BA, a kind of organic insulating layer. As the high level voltage and the low level voltage are applied to the depletion electrode DE and the cathode electrode CAT, respectively, an electric field is formed at the semiconductor having the formation in PN junction. By this electric field, the hole is prevented from being laterally flow through the layer having p-type impurities. In another word, as the depletion electrode DE works as the gate at the hole injection layer HIL and/or the hole transport layer HTL having the p-type impurities and forms the depletion area to block the lateral current.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Hereinafter, the features of the depletion electrode DE are explained according to the present disclosure. For enhancing the reality of the display, one of the representative methods is to increase the resolution. For example, the HD (High Density) rate resolution has the pixels of 1280&#xd7;720. Here, a pixel means the unit pixel representing one video pixel. Considering that the unit pixel has a red subpixel, a green subpixel and a blue subpixel, the HD rate resolution has the pixels of 3840&#xd7;720.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the case of a display for the smart phone in that the diagonal length is 6 inches and the resolution is HD rate, the unit pixel density is about 250 PPI (Pixel Per Inch) and the subpixel density is about 750 PPI. As increasing the HD resolution up to FHD (Full High Density) rate or QHD (Quadra High Density) rate, the unit pixel density is increased to 400 PPI or 500 PPI or higher. The subpixel density is increased over 1,000 PPI.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As the resolution increases, the distance or gap between subpixels will be shorter and shorter. As a result, the hole may be easily and severely leaked to the neighboring pixels along to the hole functional layer. To prevent the lateral leakage current, the doping amount of the p-type impurity may be lowered. However, the p-type impurity for increasing the efficiency of organic emitting diode may cause the degradation of the efficiency of the light emission or the increase of the power consumption.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">On the contrary, in the case that the depletion electrode DE is disposed between two neighboring anode electrodes ANO as suggested in the present disclosure, even though the gap between two neighboring pixels is getting closer as the pixel density is increased, the lateral leakage current may not be occurred. In addition, even though increasing the doping amount of the p-type impurity into the hole functional layer, the lateral leakage current may not be occurred. Therefore, the p-type impurity can be more doped into the display having the ultra-high density such as QHD or more than having the low density. As the results, for the ultra-high density display, the numbers of the electron-hole are increased and then the emission efficiency would be increased or enhanced. As the hole can be transferred into the emission layer with lower energy, the power consumption may be more reduced.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The Table 1 shows the relationship between the distance between the neighboring anode electrodes and the doping amount of the p-type impurity according to the pixel density rate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing a structure of the pixel according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Unit Pixel</entry><entry>Gap between</entry><entry>P-doping</entry><entry>Depletion</entry><entry>P-doping (with</entry></row><row><entry>Density</entry><entry>Anodes</entry><entry>(No Depletion)</entry><entry>Electrode</entry><entry>Depletion)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>200 PPI</entry><entry>a &#x3bc;m</entry><entry>&#x3c;1.2%</entry><entry>X</entry><entry>&#x3e;1.2%</entry></row><row><entry>300 PPI</entry><entry>b &#x3bc;m</entry><entry>&#x3c;1.0%</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>&#x3e;1.2%</entry></row><row><entry>400 PPI</entry><entry>c &#x3bc;m</entry><entry>&#x3c;0.6%</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>&#x3e;1.2%</entry></row><row><entry>800 PPI</entry><entry>d &#x3bc;m</entry><entry>&#x3c;0.4%</entry><entry>&#x25ef;</entry><entry>&#x3e;1.2%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Here, the &#x2018;Unit Pixel Density&#x2019; means the density of the unit pixels. For example, the unit pixel may include three subpixels such as a red subpixel, a green subpixel and a blue subpixel. The &#x2018;Gap between Anodes&#x2019; means the distance between two neighboring anode electrodes. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it means the shortest distance among d<b>1</b>, d<b>2</b> and d<b>3</b>. In Table 1, the value of a, b, c and d are satisfied the relationship of a&#x3e;b&#x3e;c&#x3e;d. The &#x2018;P-doping (No Depletion)&#x2019; means the concentration of the p-type impurity for minimizing the lateral leakage current without the depletion electrode. With these concentrations, the lateral leakage current is not eliminated, but the effect of the lateral leakage current is minimized. The &#x2018;Depletion Electrode&#x2019; means the existence of the depletion electrode. The &#x2018;P-doping (with Depletion)&#x2019; means the concentration of the p-type impurity with the depletion electrode. The &#x2018;&#x3e;1.2%&#x2019; means that the emission efficiency of the organic light emitting diode can be maximized as there is no lateral leakage current.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">As shown in the Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, at the pixel density lower than 200 PPI, the distance between the anode electrodes is a &#x3bc;m or more. For example, it may be 30 &#x3bc;m. In that case, when the p-type impurity is doped with 1.2% into the hole transport layer HTL, the lateral leakage current may not be occurred between the two neighboring subpixels, or the efficiency of the lateral leakage current is very little, even though the lateral leakage current is occurred. Therefore, the present disclosure provides the organic light emitting display having the superior color gamut property.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">As the pixel density is increased over 300 PPI, the size of each subpixel will be reduced. When the size of the organic light emitting diode OLE is reduced with the same ratio of the reduction ratio of the subpixel, it is not required to increase the concentration of &#x2018;P-doping&#x2019; for keeping the brightness because the aperture ratio is not reduced. However, as the gap between the anode electrodes ANO is getting closer, the lateral leakage current due to the p-type impurity may be occurred. In order to suppress the lateral leakage current, one method is the reduction of the doping concentration. However, this method cannot solve the lateral leakage current problem ultimately. In Table 1, the concentration of &#x2018;P-doping&#x2019; without depletion electrode does not means the concentration that does not occur the lateral leakage current. It means that there is no problem on the display quality by the lateral leakage current. In this case, as reducing the concentration of &#x2018;P-doping&#x2019; in order to reduce the lateral leakage current, the brightness of the organic light emitting diode OLE is degraded. In order to compensate the lowered brightness, more power consumption may be required.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">With the depletion electrode DE between the anode electrodes ANO, the lateral leakage current does not occur even though the p-type impurity is doped with 1.2% or more when the pixel density is 800 PPI or higher. Therefore, the present disclosure suggests an ultra-high density organic light emitting diode display having the superior color gamut, the enhanced emission efficiency and the lowered power consumption.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">When the display has the large area of which diagonal length is 40 inches or more with HD rate, the pixel density may be 200 PPI or less. In this case, without the depletion electrode, the lateral leakage current may not be occurred. Currently, the large TV monitor having the ultra-high density resolution may have the pixel density of 200 PPI or higher. In that case, the video quality may be degraded by the lateral leakage current. Applying the depletion electrode according to the present disclosure, the lateral leakage current may be ultimately blocked, so that the high video quality can be ensured for the large area TV monitor without the color distortion and the gamma distortion at the low gray scale.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">Until now, our explanation is focused on the case that the emission layers representing a specific color light at one pixel is formed at each pixel. For another case, the emission layer representing a white color light is deposited over the whole surface of the substrate and the color filters are formed at each pixel. In this case, the depletion electrode may be further disposed between pixels to block the lateral leakage current. Therefore, the superior video quality without the color distortion/degradation can ensured.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">Until now, the p-type impurity is doped at the hole functional layers. This is for explaining the characteristics of the present disclosure, so it is not limited on the p-type impurity only. For example, the emission layer has the p-type impurity as close to the anode electrode and the n-type impurity as close to the cathode electrode. In that case, the hole functional layer and the electron functional layer may not be included into the organic light emitting layer. As the pixel density is increased, the color degradation may be occurred by the lateral leakage current through the emission layer. In this case, the lateral leakage current may be blocked by applying the depletion electrode according to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Hereinafter, referring to the figures, we will explain about the shape structure and the layout structure of the depletion electrode according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a layout structure of a depletion electrode disposed between two neighboring anode electrodes according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a layout structure of a depletion electrode disposed between two neighboring anode electrodes according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the depletion electrode DE may be disposed between neighboring two anode electrodes ANO. For example, two anode electrodes ANO may be apart from each other with an anode gap G<sub>ANO</sub>. The depletion electrode DE may be disposed as apart from each anode electrode ANO with a predetermined distance. The depletion electrode DE is not contacted to each anode electrode ANO. The depletion electrode DE may have a width range from 30% to 60% of the anode gap G<sub>ANO</sub>.

The closest length between the two neighboring anode electrodes ANO may be defined as an anode gap G<sub>ANO</sub>. A depletion electrode DE may be disposed between the neighboring two anode electrodes ANO. The lateral leakage current may have the maximum value at the minimum area Dmin where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>has minimum value. Therefore, to ensure the effects of the depletion electrode DE, the width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrode DE may have the maximum value Max at the minimum area Dmin where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>has the minimum value. The width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrode DE may have the minimum value Min at the area where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>has a larger value than the minimum value. In other words, as the lateral leakage current where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>is relatively wider may be very small amount or may not be occurred where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>is relatively narrower, the width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrode DE where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>is relatively wider may be narrower than that where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>is relatively narrower. Therefore, the width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrode DE formed at the area excepting the minimum area Dmin where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>has the minimum value may be equal or less than the width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrode DE formed at the minimum area Dmin where the anode gap G<sub>ANO </sub>has the minimum value. By setting the depletion electrode DE at the area excepting the minimum area Dmin has the minimum width Min, the depletion electrodes DE having the maximum width Max at the minimum areas Dmin can be electrically connected each other using the depletion electrodes DE having the minimum width Min. The width W<sub>DE </sub>of the depletion electrodes DE may have various values, for example, at least two widths, so that the depletion electrodes DE can be disposed on the display panel with an optimum structure.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">Hereinafter, referring to figures, we will explain about the various configurations of the depletion electrode according to the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a plane view illustrating a layout structure of a depletion electrode according to a first example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a plurality of anode electrodes ANO is disposed in a matrix manner.
