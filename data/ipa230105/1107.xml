Low levels of electrolytes in the system can lead to cramping. Salt pills provide large salt doses to attempt to overcome this issue with endurance athletes. This approach can oversupply the body with sodium to overcome the delay in bioavailability through the GI tract. A mechanism for delivering a smaller dose of electrolytes to the buccal mucosa may provide the necessary electrolytes with more rapid bioavailability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During exercise, the body requires more oxygen than when the body is at rest. When oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles faster to replace the used oxygen, the muscles will begin to convert the available glucose to lactic acid. This will build up in the muscle, causing fatigue. More rapid delivery of oxygen to the system during exertion can reduce fatigue. Supplemental oxygen therapy has been demonstrated to improve athletic performance and decrease reaction times.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The benefits of proper hydration and supplemental oxygen therapy on athletic performance are demonstrable. Therefore, it is desirable to have a means of delivering electrolytes and oxygen to an athlete during athletic activities that do not impede on those activities.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a hands-free electrolyte dispenser.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a flexible joiner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a bicycle attachment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A hands-free electrolyte dispenser is described.
