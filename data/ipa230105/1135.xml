Also, some disease states require mechanical cardio-pulmonary support via peripheral artery cannulation. This peripheral artery is often, but not always, the femoral artery. Insertion into the femoral artery of an arterial cannula of sufficient size to support the patient with cardiopulmonary bypass often leads to compromised blood flow to the lower limb which can lead to ischemia and tissue necrosis during prolonged procedures.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previously proposed methods of providing perfusion to the body while maintaining perfusion to the lower limb are generally inconvenient and often do not provide a satisfactory solution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has previously been proposed to use an undersized cannula, based on the assumption that the smaller cannula will allow blood flow back over the body of the cannula between the cannula body and the arterial wall. In practice it is difficult to achieve adequate perfusion to the lower limb and using a cannula of a smaller size than what is actually required compromises perfusion to the body and increases line pressures, thus increasing the risk of red blood cell hemolysis, increased backpressure to the membrane oxygenator and the perfusion pump and the increased risk of damage to these vital pieces of equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has also been previously proposed to insert a further perfusion cannula downstream of a first, main perfusion cannula. Inserting a downstream cannula can be technically difficult and a percutaneous approach often requires ultrasound guidance to allow accurate placement. This technique requires an extra cannula and an extra perfusion line that must be connected into the arterial side of the perfusion circuit and can be time consuming. It also results in extra hardware being disposed in the groin incision area, an area that is already compromised for space with the femoral arterial and femoral venous lines already in place. The downstream cannula would typically be a small cannula which is more susceptible to positional changes, resulting in less reliable downstream flow.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It has also been previously proposed to sew a side graft to the artery when using femoral artery cannulation. In this technique, surgeons sew on a Dacron graft to the side of the femoral artery as an end to side anastomosis and a cannula is inserted into the graft. This technique is time consuming, taking approximately 30 minutes to sew on the graft and cannulate it, compared with approximately 2 minutes to insert a bidirectional femoral cannula. Furthermore, this technique requires an open surgical procedure which can be difficult in an ICU setting. Bleeding can also be a problem in patients requiring extended periods of support and when support ceases, the base of the Dacron graft may be left in situ with this technique, creating a potential source for thrombus formation and infection.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is desirable to provide a single cannula that provides adequate perfusion to the lower limb. However, as will be discussed below, previously proposed cannulae suffer a number of drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been previously proposed to provide a conventional cannula with side perfusion holes through which blood can flow toward the lower limb. Such arrangements have been disclosed in WO03/068303 to Laksen et al. and in &#x201c;A Novel Femoral Arterial Cannula to Prevent Limb Ischemia During Cardiopulmonary Support Preliminary Report of Experimental and Clinical Experiences&#x201d; by Matsui et al. in Artif Organs, Vol. 30, No. 7 2006. In arrangements having side perfusion holes, the cannula must be correctly positioned in the artery so that the holes are not occluded, and maintained in that position. In these arrangements, no tactile feedback is available to assist with positioning of the holes and assistance in maintaining the holes in correct position is not provided. If the cannula migrates distally the holes will be occluded by wall of artery. If the cannula migrates proximally then the holes may move outside of the artery and cause bleeding. If the side holes are at level of the arteriotomy, perfusion into the wall of the artery may cause a dissection.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To prevent occlusion of side holes provided in a conventional cannula, it has been proposed to provide rails adjacent the holes to prevent occlusion of the holes. Such an arrangement has been disclosed in &#x201c;A femoral artery cannula that allows distal blood flow&#x201d; by Magovern, J. et al. (The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, September 2005). The configuration of the rails can be complicated and difficulties will be encountered with their insertion and removal through the wall of the artery. The rails also create a ridged cross section which creates a potential for bleeding during insertion and removal. Furthermore, blood passing through the side holes is not efficiently communicated as it is directed against the wall of artery.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternative rail configurations have also been proposed to facilitate insertion of the cannula into the artery while attempting to prevent occlusion of side holes. Documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,171,218 and 5,330,433 by Fonger, J. et al, each disclose an arrangement in which the rails are in the form of forward pointing barbs between which a slanted elongate hole located in a depression on the exterior of the wall of the cannula is disposed. The depression impinges into the main lumen to act as a scoop to divert blood toward the lower limb.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As with previous proposals, difficulties will be encountered with insertion and removal due to the cross-sectional shape of the barbs, which, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> of each of the documents, is ridged in the region of the barbs/rails and will require the artery to stretch during insertion and removal. As this region passes through the artery wall, this ridged cross section may also create channels between the ridges that may result in bleeding during insertion and removal.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the main lumen is narrowed by the side hole depression, thereby reducing flow capability. The most important determinant of flow through a cannula, as determined by the Poiseulle-Hagen equation, is cannula radius. Decreasing radius by half causes a decrease in flow of sixteen times. Reducing the radius in a femoral cannula that is already being pushed to achieve maximal flow rates is a major compromise in the primary function, that is, providing flow equal to systemic cardiac output.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Due to the configuration of the barbs and the side aperture, this arrangement may be difficult to manufacture. Furthermore, flow from the side aperture does not have an open area of artery to flow into, thereby reducing flow efficiency and creating an area of turbulent flow.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As discussed above, each of the previously proposed bi-directional cannulae have suffered from a number of problems. Furthermore, general poor performance has been observed due to issues with occlusion of side facing holes/apertures. The Inventors have found that the previous poor performance can at least partially be attributed to two factors, arterial spasm and downstream compression.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Arterial Spasm relates to the normal physiological response of contraction of arterial smooth muscle to stretch or local trauma. Arterial spasm around the body of the cannula will result in a reduction of blood flow back around the cannula and down the leg. This can even occur around undersized cannula.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Downstream Compression, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is a mechanism that has not been previously acknowledged. The body of a standard femoral cannula causes a distortion of the arterial wall around the point of insertion. As the cannula tends to lie in the orientation of the artery, the body of the cannula causes a downward displacement of the distal edge of the arteriotomy, and compression of the artery just distal to the arteriotomy.

The elongate tube <b>12</b> comprises a first aperture <b>14</b> at a distal end of the elongate tube <b>12</b> which is forward during insertion of the cannula into an artery. The first aperture <b>14</b> is configured so that blood can flow into the artery in the direction of insertion and towards the arterial circulation of the patient.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The elongate tube <b>12</b> also comprises an elbow <b>16</b> which is formed in the elongate tube. The elbow <b>16</b> is preformed such that in a relaxed state prior to insertion the cannula has an elbow bend in it. In the example shown, the elbow bends through an angle of 130 degrees, which has been found to be the angle that best alleviates the downstream compression of the artery distal to the arteriotomy and allows the cannula to achieve a suitable lie outside the artery. It will be appreciated that other angles, such as 120 degrees, and particularly those in the range of 90 to 180 degrees may also be suitable. Angles outside of this range may not be effective at alleviating downstream compression or allowing the intravascular and extra vascular sections of the cannula to achieve a suitable lie. The elbow <b>16</b> allows the elongate tube <b>12</b> to transition a suitable amount so that a second aperture <b>18</b>, in the form of a rearward facing aperture can be provided for bi-directional perfusion.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Previously proposed arrangements, such as those disclosed in Fonger et al, do not include an elbow so that a rearward facing aperture directing blood into the artery and not into the artery wall can be provided. The inventors have found that, in use, an artery which is naturally flexible, and less rigid than a conventional cannula, tends to bend around a straight cannula when inserted in the artery, thereby acting to close the artery in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Arrangements having side facing holes are particularly susceptible to this problem. By providing an elbow and a rearward facing aperture, it is possible to avoid obstruction or covering of the aperture by the artery wall, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, thus increasing the effectiveness of the cannula. In particular, the problems discussed above in relation to arterial spasm and downstream compression can be alleviated as the rearward facing aperture is away from the artery wall.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The elbow <b>16</b> also assists in positioning of the cannula <b>10</b> as it passes from the femoral artery to the surface of the leg. The angle used for the elbow <b>16</b> is selected so as to reduce the amount of downstream or distal artery compression.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As illustrated, the second aperture <b>18</b> is formed in or slightly rearward, i.e. away from the insertion or forward direction, of the elbow <b>16</b>. The second aperture <b>18</b> faces rearward and is configured for supplying blood directly into the artery in a second direction which is generally opposite to the forward or insertion direction so as to achieve bi-directional perfusion in the artery. In the examples shown, the second aperture <b>18</b> is formed in the elbow, though it may be formed slightly rearward of the elbow and still provide adequate bi-directional perfusion in the artery. Forming the second aperture <b>18</b> in or slightly rearward of the elbow <b>16</b> allows a second path for blood flow to be provided without impinging on or narrowing the lumen of the elongate tube <b>12</b>, thereby avoiding a reduction in blood flow through the cannula <b>10</b>. The configuration of the elbow <b>16</b> and the second aperture <b>18</b> is such that when the cannula <b>10</b> is inserted into the artery, the second aperture <b>18</b> is correctly orientated within the artery.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The elongate tube <b>12</b> has a single protuberance <b>20</b> which is formed on the elbow <b>16</b> and is configured to facilitate insertion and positioning of the cannula <b>10</b> in the artery. The protuberance <b>20</b> is formed on and extends along an outer surface of the elbow <b>16</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A to <b>6</b>C</figref>, the extent of the single protuberance <b>20</b> is generally limited to a lower one half of the cross section and is not visible when viewed from in-front (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) or above the cannula <b>10</b>. The single protuberance <b>20</b> defines a single continuous enlargement of the thickness of the elongate tube extending from the distal end of the single protuberance <b>20</b> to the proximal end of the single protuberance <b>20</b>. The thickness of the elongate tube <b>12</b> through the single protuberance is greater than that of the elongate tube <b>12</b> extending proximally and distally therefrom.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The protuberance <b>20</b> tapers in the insertion direction to allow insertion of the cannula into the artery with minimal trauma. In this regard, the taper is gradual so as to allow the artery wall to gradually expand as the cannula <b>10</b> is inserted. The angle of the taper is between approximately 3 to 25 degrees. For differently sized cannulae, the taper angle will be the same, though the maximum thickness of the protuberance will depend on the size of the cannula. For example, a 20F cannula will have a protuberance with a maximum thickness, excluding the thickness of the elongate tube on which it is formed, of approximately 1.5 mm. It will be appreciated that the size of the protuberance formed on smaller cannulae will be scaled down and smaller. The protuberance <b>20</b> may be considered a single continuous segment of the elongate tube <b>12</b> that has a greater wall thickness than that of the elongate tube <b>12</b> extending proximally and distally therefrom.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The size of the protuberance <b>20</b> is small enough so as to allow insertion of the cannula <b>10</b> into the artery with minimal trauma, though large enough to prevent accidental dislodgement of the cannula <b>10</b>. The size of the protuberance <b>20</b> is also sufficient so that the second aperture <b>18</b> can be formed between the distal end and the proximal end of the single protuberance <b>20</b> and extend through the length of greater wall thickness so as to orientate the second aperture <b>18</b> within the artery.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">An intermediate portion (see the enlarged detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) comprises the protuberance <b>20</b> and elbow <b>16</b>, which together form a transition zone <b>28</b> where a cross sectional size of the elongate tube <b>12</b> gradually increases and then decreases so that it can be inserted into the artery with minimal trauma inflicted on the artery wall. In the examples shown, the protuberance <b>20</b> is generally ovoid in cross section, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref>, though other shapes may also be used.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The transition zone <b>28</b> acts to splint open the artery so that the artery is not compressed by the body of the cannula and allows unimpeded flow in the second direction. The transition zone <b>28</b> acts to support the artery wall away from the second aperture <b>18</b> so that the artery is held open and does not block the flow of blood from the cannula <b>10</b> into the artery. The transition zone <b>28</b> also acts to provide stability to the cannula <b>10</b> when inserted in an artery so as to maintain the cannula <b>10</b> in position.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> tapers at a greater rate than it does in the insertion direction so as to provide greater resistance during removal than during insertion. The rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> tapers more sharply so that a side profile of the protuberance <b>20</b> generally has the form of a rounded shoulder.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The inventors have found that by providing a protuberance in the form of a rounded shoulder, a good balance between minimizing arterial trauma during removal and resistance to removal can be achieved. The protuberance also provides a self-locating mechanism. In this regard, the increased resistance provided against removal of the cannula allows a surgeon to insert the cannula <b>10</b> under slight resistance to a predetermined depth at which the resistance will reduce. The cannula <b>10</b> can then be retracted slightly until increased resistance is felt, providing direct tactile feedback to indicate that the cannula is correctly placed in the artery. The increased resistance provided against removal also prevents accidental or unintentional withdrawal of the cannula <b>10</b> from the artery. This is important because if the second aperture <b>18</b> moves outside the artery, blood may flow from the cannula outside the artery causing bleeding.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">By providing a protuberance in the form of a rounded shoulder, ridges, rails or barbs which can create channels for bleeding during insertion and removal are avoided.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> is disposed at a predetermined distance from the second aperture <b>18</b> so that when the cannula <b>10</b> is placed in a desired position in an artery, the second aperture <b>18</b> is positioned well within the artery.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> lies against the arteriotomy to act as a scaffold, effectively stenting open the downstream artery, which would otherwise move to conform with the shape of the cannula and compress the downstream artery potentially occlude flow from a side perfusion hole down the artery. By stenting open the artery, the protuberance maintains a channel through which blood can flow unobstructed down the leg.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the examples shown, the second aperture <b>18</b> extends through the protuberance <b>20</b> and in a direction generally away from the forward end of the tube, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, so as to provide flow to a lower limb which is generally unimpeded. Due to the size of the cannula and the artery into which it is intended to be received, the protuberance generally surrounds the second aperture <b>18</b> so that the second aperture <b>18</b> is well placed within the artery when the cannula is positioned within the artery.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an innermost portion of the second aperture <b>18</b> which is inside the lumen of the elongate tube <b>12</b> is generally funnel shaped to minimize turbulence of blood flowing within the elongate tube <b>12</b> and through the second aperture <b>18</b>. The size of the second aperture <b>18</b> may be varied in accordance with differently sized elongate tubes to achieve different proportions of flow to the lower limb. In the example shown, the diameter of the second aperture <b>18</b> is 2.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the elongate tube <b>12</b> terminates at the first aperture <b>14</b>. It can also be seen that the elongate tube <b>12</b> tapers at the forward end in a region proximal the first aperture <b>14</b>. A flexible elongate introducer <b>22</b> can be received through the elongate tube <b>12</b> with its tip passing out of the first aperture <b>14</b>. The introducer <b>22</b> aids insertion into the artery by providing a tapered end protruding out of the first aperture <b>14</b>. The introducer also prevents blood flowing back from the first aperture <b>14</b>. The first aperture <b>14</b> is configured to engage the introducer <b>22</b> which is received through the elongate tube <b>12</b> to prevent blood flow through the first aperture <b>14</b> and into the elongate tube <b>12</b> whilst an introducer <b>22</b> is received in the elongate tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the elongate tube <b>12</b> can be configured so that an internal diameter of the elongate tube <b>12</b>, in a region around the second aperture <b>18</b>, is greater than a diameter of a corresponding portion of the elongate introducer <b>22</b> when received therethrough so that blood can pass into the elongate tube <b>12</b> through the second aperture <b>18</b> to indicate that the second aperture <b>18</b> has passed into the artery <b>21</b>. In this regard, the elongate introducer <b>22</b>, when inserted in the elongate tube, narrows in the region of the second aperture <b>18</b> to allow entry of blood into the elongate tube <b>12</b>. The internal diameter of the elongate tube <b>12</b> is generally constant along a length of the elongate tube <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The resulting flash of blood entering the elongate tube <b>12</b> as the second aperture <b>18</b> passes into the artery provides a physician with a visual indication that the cannula <b>10</b> is almost in position. This flash of blood is particularly helpful during percutaneous insertion. Inserting the cannula <b>10</b> a little further into the artery <b>21</b> from this position allows a rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> to pass into the artery. Once this rearward portion has passed into the artery <b>21</b>, the sharper taper of the rearward portion of the protuberance <b>20</b> works to prevent accidental or unintentional withdrawal.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, forward of the protuberance <b>20</b> and rearward of the taper proximal the first aperture <b>14</b>, the external diameter of the elongate tube <b>12</b> is generally constant before transitioning into the protuberance <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). The diameter of the elongate tube <b>12</b> transitions back or returns to this constant value rearward of the protuberance <b>20</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>. The size of the elongate tube <b>12</b> is selected to provide adequate blood flow to the patient and an external diameter of the elongate tube may be between approximately 3 mm and approximately 8 mm Depending on the size of the patient and the elongate tube used, obstruction of flow around the body of the cannula may occur.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The elongate tube <b>12</b> is formed of flexible material so as to at least partially straighten out when an introducer <b>22</b> is inserted into the cannula <b>10</b> to facilitate insertion of the cannula <b>10</b> into an artery. Once the introducer <b>22</b> is removed, the elongate tube <b>12</b> will return to its natural shape so as to splint open the artery, as discussed above. The elongate tube <b>12</b> may become almost completely straight when an introducer <b>22</b> is inserted into the cannula <b>10</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the elongate tube <b>12</b> is formed of a wire-reinforced material. In the described example, the elongate tube is formed of a flexible polyurethane material which is generally transparent, though it will be appreciated that other materials, such as silicone may also be used.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some examples, different sections of the cannula <b>10</b> may be made from different materials. For example, the elbow <b>16</b> may be formed from a different material than the elongate tube <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the elbow <b>16</b> may be formed of a flexible material such as PVC, polyurethane, silicone or rubber and configured so as to be inflatable. An inflatable elbow may be configured for manual inflation or configured to be self-inflating. In such an example, the elbow <b>16</b> may remain in an uninflated or partially inflated state during insertion then become inflated to a form generally in accordance with that previously described ready for use. In this regard, when in position and inflated, the inflatable elbow provides a protuberance <b>20</b> and houses the second aperture <b>18</b> so that bi-directional perfusion can be achieved. The inflatable elbow may be configured to expand against the inner wall of the artery to hold the cannula in place and to keep the wall spaced from the second aperture <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A proximal end <b>24</b> of the cannula <b>10</b> is shown with a standard &#x215c;&#x2033; connector. Such a generic fitting may be used, or other commercially available fittings may be substituted to allow the cannula <b>10</b> to be used with different perfusion tubing.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The previously described embodiments have been described in relation to generally inserting the cannula <b>10</b> into an artery. It will be appreciated that the cannula <b>10</b> is suitable for direct insertion into the artery with open surgical exposure and also suitable for percutaneous use.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">During percutaneous use, which may continue for a number of days, it is desirable to ensure that the cannula remains correctly placed in the artery so that adequate perfusion is maintained. To ensure that adequate perfusion is maintained, the pressure of blood flowing into the artery behind the cannula and toward a limb, i.e. the perfusion blood which is flowing away from the arterial circulation of the patient, may be monitored.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrate an example of an arrangement for monitoring a pressure of perfusion blood flowing toward a limb, so as to indicate adequacy of downstream flow and position of the cannula <b>10</b>. In the illustrated example, a manometer tube <b>30</b> extends adjacent to the elongate tube <b>12</b>. The manometer tube <b>30</b> passes through a wall of the elongate tube at a location behind the protuberance <b>20</b> in the insertion direction. This location is such that its position will be outside the patient in use. It will be appreciated that the manometer tube <b>30</b> may pass through the wall of the elongate tube at other locations behind the protuberance <b>20</b> and still provide the required communication between the manometer tube <b>30</b> and a pressure transducer. The manometer tube <b>30</b> passes through the elongate tube <b>12</b> and terminates at aperture <b>32</b> which is adjacent the second aperture <b>18</b>. The position of the aperture <b>32</b> is such that the pressure of blood flowing toward the limb may be monitored.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The manometer tube <b>30</b> is configured to accept a connector <b>34</b> to allow connection between the manometer tube <b>30</b> and a pressure transducer (not shown). In use, when the cannula <b>10</b> is inserted in the artery, blood will flow through the aperture <b>18</b> and into an artery of the patient toward a limb. The pressure transducer will measure the pressure of this blood flowing toward the limb so that it may be determined if there is sufficient flow toward the limb. A reading from the pressure transducer may thus be used to indicate if the cannula is placed correctly in the artery. In this regard, when the cannula is placed correctly in the artery, the pressure reading will initially demonstrate pulsatile flow transmitted through the elongate tube from aperture <b>14</b>. Once non-pulsatile flow commences through the elongate tube, monitoring the trend in pressure as well as the absolute pressure, will indicate any changes in perfusion towards the limb. Incorrect placement may involve the cannula being inserted too far into the artery, in which case the second aperture may become covered, or not being inserted far enough, in which case the second aperture would not be located within the artery and there would be little or no flow into the artery.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The pressure transducer may also be used to confirm that an initial placement of the cannula <b>10</b> is correct.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The use of a pressure transducer may be beneficial in environments where prolonged perfusion is common, such as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) units and in Intensive Care Units.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">To allow insertion of the cannula <b>10</b> and tapered introducer <b>22</b> into an artery, known guide wire techniques are used.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A method of inserting the bi-directional perfusion cannula <b>10</b> into an artery comprises the steps of feeding the distal end of the elongate tube <b>12</b> with introducer <b>22</b> received therethrough into the artery (over a guide wire after predilating the artery with dilators) until an increase in resistance to insertion is felt to indicate that the protuberance <b>20</b> is entering the artery. The elongate tube <b>12</b> is then eased into the artery until the elbow <b>16</b> and the protuberance <b>20</b> have passed into the artery and the amount of resistance reduces. The elongate tube <b>12</b> is then retracted until an increase in resistance to retraction is felt to indicate that the protuberance <b>20</b> is abutting the artery wall and the cannula <b>10</b> is in position.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Once the cannula is in position, the introducer <b>22</b> may be removed so that the cannula <b>10</b> can be connected to suitable perfusion equipment.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">After treatment, the cannula <b>10</b> is retracted by easing the protuberance <b>20</b> through a wall of the artery, whereby an opening formed in the artery wall is gradually enlarged by the increasing cross-sectional size of the protuberance <b>20</b> so that the elongate tube <b>12</b> can be removed generally without causing further trauma to the artery. Pressure may be applied to the femoral artery at a distal location to assist in passing of the protuberance through the artery wall so that the elongate tube can be withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.
