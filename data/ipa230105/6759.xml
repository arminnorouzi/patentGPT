level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for optical pulse sequence generation.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Time division multiplexing (TDM) is a well-known technique for transmitting data in which multiple data-carrying channels are multiplexed into a single signal for transmission by allocating successive time portions of the signal to the various channels in a repeating sequence. The signal amplitude of the time portions of each channel is modulated to encode or indicate the data carried by that channel. Each channel hence carries data at a particular speed or bit rate which is lower than the combined bit rate for the multiplexed signal, which can be up to the maximum bit rate able to be handled by the medium used for transmission.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An example of TDM, commonly used in modern telecommunications, is optical time division multiplexing (OTDM), in which light is transmitted to carry the data in each channel. Each channel comprises a series of pulses of optical power at the same, specified, repetition rate, and the pulses in each channel are offset or delayed in time relative to the pulses in the other channels to form an interleaved sequence of pulses, being the multiplexed signal, when the channels are combined. Typically, optical (photonic) components and electronic components are used in combination in order to generate the optical pulses and modulate the pulse amplitudes to encode the data onto each channel. This allows the components to operate at a lower speed (which is typically more practical and achievable) than the total speed of the multiplexed signal able to be supported by the optical fibre transmission medium. The components can be miniaturised chip-based components, in which the light is carried by optical waveguides formed in the chip material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many known OTDM devices create the pulse sequences for each channel by introducing different amounts of optical delay to synchronised pulse sequences initially lacking the required offset in time. The delays shift the pulses to the required time positions to create the interleaving in the multiplexed signal. The delay is applied using optical delay lines in the form of different lengths of optical fibre or on-chip waveguide for each channel, so that the different pulse sequences experience different propagation times through the delay lines and hence emerge with offset pulse timings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This approach has drawbacks, however. Firstly, the optical delay lines inevitably introduce optical insertion loss for each channel, whereby optical power is lost in the mere process of propagation along the delay line. This is undesirable in itself, but made worse by the longer delays lines producing greater overall loss so the different channels are degraded by different amounts. Secondly, the amount of delay, and hence the rate of pulses in the multiplexed signal, is determined by the fixed physical lengths of the delay lines, so that a given OTDM device can operate at a single speed or bit rate (data rate) only. This may limit the practical utilisation of the device, and offers no data rate flexibility.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, improved optical pulse sequence generation methods and apparatus for optical pulse sequence generation are of interest.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects and embodiments are set out in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of certain embodiments described herein, there is provided a method of generating multiple channels of optical pulses, comprising: providing a continuous wave optical input having an optical power; dividing the optical power of the optical input into equal consecutive slices in the time domain; and allocating the consecutive slices sequentially to two or more optical outputs such that each output forms a channel of optical pulses of equal pulse repetition rate shifted in time relative to the or each other channel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second aspect of certain embodiments described herein, there is provided a device for generating multiple channels of optical pulses, the device comprising: an electro-optic modulator configured to receive an input comprising a continuous wave optical input having an optical power; a signal generator configured to generate drive signals for the electro-optic modulator comprising a first pair of oscillating voltages with a phase difference of 180&#xb0;; and an optical combiner configured to receive the modulated optical power from the electro-optic modulator and pass alternate portions of the optical power to two output ports; in order to divide the optical power of the optical input into equal consecutive slices in the time domain, and allocate the consecutive slices sequentially to the two output ports such that the output from each output port forms a channel of optical pulses of equal pulse repetition rate shifted in time relative to the other channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and further aspects of certain embodiments are set out in the appended independent and dependent claims.

An optical source <b>1</b>, such as a mode-locked laser, is configured to generate a pulsed optical input <b>2</b> for the system, comprising a stream of optical pulses <b>3</b> with a pulse width and a pulse repetition rate. For a desired symbol rate fs in the final multiplexed output, the repetition rate is fs/4 (where this system operates over four channels), and the pulse width Ts, or symbol period, corresponds to the inverse of the symbol rate, so Ts=1/fs. The input <b>2</b> enters the system at an input coupler <b>4</b> which couples the light into a waveguide network to carry the light through the system, which is chip-based. The light enters the input port of a first 1&#xd7;2 splitter <b>5</b> which divides the light equally between two output ports. Each output port passes the light to two further 1&#xd7;2 splitters <b>6</b> which again divide the light equally, producing four channels <b>7</b> each carrying a quarter of the power of the original optical input, and comprising a pulse sequence of the original repetition rate fs/4 synchronised in time with the pulse sequences of the other channels (so that the pulses overlap in the time domain). A waveguide carries each channel <b>7</b> through an electro-optic modulator <b>8</b>, each of which is driven by an appropriate driving signal <b>9</b> representing an electrical input <b>10</b> desired to be encoded onto each channel. The modulators <b>8</b> modulate the power amplitude of the pulses in each channel <b>7</b> according to the electrical inputs <b>10</b>. For example, the electrical inputs <b>10</b> may be configured to encode data according to a known scheme, such as OOK or PAM-4.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The modulators <b>8</b> each output the modulated pulses sequences into a waveguide having an optical delay line <b>11</b> comprising one or more spiral waveguide portions <b>12</b>, which act to increase the length of the respective waveguides and hence increase the propagation time for light in each channel. Recalling that the symbol period is Ts, each optical delay line <b>11</b> introduces a delay which is a multiple of the symbol period in order to offset the pulses between the channels by an appropriate amount to achieve the symbol rate fs. Hence, a first channel has no delay line so provide a zero delay, OTs, a second channel has a delay line that delays by Ts, a third channel delays by 2 Ts and the fourth channel delays by 3 Ts. In this example each spiral waveguide portion <b>12</b> is designed to delay by Ts, and each channel has a number of spiral waveguide portions <b>12</b> that gives the desired total delay. Hence, the output <b>13</b> from the delay lines <b>11</b> is the four pulse sequences each delayed relative to the original sequence timing by a multiple of Ts. In order to achieve the final multiplexed and modulated signal, the four channels are coupled into the input ports of two 2&#xd7;1 optical combiners <b>14</b>, the two output ports of which are fed to the input ports of a final 2&#xd7;1 combiner <b>15</b>, the output of which is delivered to an output coupler <b>16</b>.

The electronic components, namely the modulators <b>8</b>, operated at the much lower speed of 26 Gbaud (note this is one quarter of the OOK speed). This corresponds to a symbol period Ts of 9.6 ps. Hence, each spiral waveguide <b>12</b> provides this amount of delay, giving overall a 9.6 ps difference between adjacent channels. While this data rate is usefully high, it is also fixed at a given wavelength, according to the length of the spiral waveguides, and cannot be changed within a given system. Also, inevitable fabrication variations between systems intended to be identical will change the intended fixed rate slightly, giving inconsistencies.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">This is problematic in the context of telecommunications, in which IEEE standards strictly define data rates that must be used. There is no tolerance for data rates within a range, since the applicable rate for any system defines a large number of operating parameters such as data-frame rate, clock speed and synchronisation. Accordingly, an OTDM device that does not comply with the standards will not be accepted for use in the telecommunications industry.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, there is an amplitude difference between successive bits in the multiplexed signal generated by the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> arrangement, owing to the different levels of insertion loss introduced by the different lengths of delay line. This quality difference in optical modulation amplitude is also undesirable in a commercial arrangement.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hence, it can be seen that the use of optical delay lines in an OTDM device has associated drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a further previously proposed example OTDM system which achieves a multiplexed signal without optical delay lines [2].</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this system, an optical source <b>20</b> in the form of a laser is configured to produce a continuous wave optical input <b>21</b> for the system. Note the contrast with the pulsed optical input of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> arrangement, where the pulses required for OTDM are present in the input stage. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> system uses a non-pulsed, continuous wave optical signal as its input, and creates the pulses at a later stage. The continuous wave laser beam <b>21</b> is passed through an optical splitter arrangement <b>22</b> which divides the light equally between multiple branches or channels, so that each branch carries the same level of continuous wave power. Each branch <b>22</b> delivers its light to a so-called &#x201c;sinc-pulse sequence generator&#x201d; <b>23</b>. These are described in detail elsewhere [3], but comprise electro-optic intensity modulators driven by n radio frequencies (RF) from an RF source <b>24</b> which output a sequence of pulses in the form of Nyquist-shaped sinc pulses. For the present purposes, the form of the pulses is not important. However, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> system, each pulse generator <b>23</b> is driven at a different phase delay &#x394;&#x3c6; of the RF drive signals. This has the effect of delaying the pulse sequences in time relative to each other, in proportion to the size of the phase delay. Hence, the pulses generators <b>23</b> output the desired multiple channels of pulse sequences with different time delays, required for OTDM. The different channels are then each delivered to a variable attenuator <b>25</b>, each of which is driven by an electrical signal S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> . . .

The variable attenuators <b>25</b> therefore output the channels of pulse sequences <b>28</b> each appropriately modulated in amplitude.

However, a common feature of both arrangements is that the initial optical input to the OTDM device is divided between the multiple channels by splitting the power equally, so the optical power in each channel is a portion of the original optical input power from the optical source or laser. Each channel thus carries a lower amplitude version of the original input sequence, in which pulses are already present in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or in which pulses are formed in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Recalling that the systems are configured to write data onto the channels by amplitude modulation, the available modulation depth within each channel is therefore limited, owing to the reduced power amplitude per channel.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present disclosure proposes to address this drawback by taking the total optical power originating from the optical source and dividing it by splitting it into consecutive portions or slices in the time domain, rather than in the power domain. Each slice has the same finite duration, so that all slices are substantially equal in time. For a continuous wave optical power input, a sequence of consecutive and contiguous slices of power with respect to time is hence achieved, where each slice has the same power amplitude, which is, importantly, the same as the power amplitude of the original optical input. Then, the slices can be allocated in a repeating sequence across the desired number of channels, in order to define the required channels, each slice becoming a pulse. Each channel comprises a sequence of pulses of the original power amplitude and having the same repetition rate (according to the equal duration of the slices and the number of channels to which the slices are allocated), but each sequence being shifted in time relative to the other channel sequences since each slice occupies a unique portion of time. The pulses of each channel can be separated out from those of the other channels in order to be utilised as required. For example, to achieve OTDM as described above, the pulses of each channel undergo amplitude modulation to receive the data to be carried by that channel, and the individual pulse sequences are then recombined to provide a multiplexed signal. This is an example of digital to analogue conversion (DAC), where digital data is carried by electrical drive signals for modulators used to perform the amplitude modulation, and hence converted into analogue data represented by the pulse amplitudes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a graph of power against time for a quantity of pulses <b>30</b> produced in this manner. A continuous wave of optical power P is provided. The term &#x201c;continuous wave&#x201d; indicates that power is continuously present at all times, in contrast with a pulsed wave or signal, in which brief bursts of power are interspersed with periods of zero power, typically at a fixed frequency or pulse repetition rate. In some cases, the power of a continuous wave may have a varying non-zero value over time, but in the present case, the power P is usefully maintained constant so that all pulses generated by slicing the power in the time domain have the same power amplitude, to which amplitude modulation can be applied. The continuous power P has been sliced into equal portions in the time domain, each of the same duration t, where each interval t is contiguous with the preceding and following intervals. Then, the series of contiguous pulses obtained by the slicing is allocated in sequence to the required channels, which in this case comprise a total of 4 channels, A, B, C and D. Hence, a first pulse and every following fourth pulse is allocated to channel A, a second pulse and every following fourth pulse is allocated to channel B, a third pulse and every following fourth pulse is allocated to channel C, and a fourth pulse and every following fourth is allocated to channel D. The next, fifth, pulse already belongs to channel A. The pulses may be separated out of the contiguous sequence for each channel for processing such as by amplitude modulation, and recombined into a multiplexed signal later if appropriate, in which case they will have the same interleaved sequence in time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Of course, more than four or fewer than four channels could be created if desired, by suitable repetitive sequential distribution of consecutive pulses. Apparatus to generate the pulse sequences may be configured accordingly.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a graph of power against time showing the allocation of power to multiple channels in the known system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Again, a continuous wave of constant power P is provided, but it is divided in the power domain into equal portions, to provide multiple portions A to N each with a lower power P&#x2032; equal to P/N, which gives a power which is constant over time for each channel. These portions of constant power are then delivered to the pulse generators shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to be converted into pulse sequences. The same approach is effectively used in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> system, although the input power is already in a pulsed format, of peak pulse power P. Each of the four channels ends up with a lower peak pulse power of P/4.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In reality, pulses produced according to the proposed time-slicing scheme will have slightly lower power or intensity than the original continuous wave input, but this is due to unavoidable optical loss inherent in the components used to generate the pulses. Such loss is common to the approaches of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> also (so the pulse power will typically be slightly less than P&#x2032;) so the proposed approach is not detrimental in this respect.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a first example apparatus or device configured to generate multiple channels of optical pulses, in this case, two channels. An optical source <b>40</b> generates a continuous wave (CW) optical signal <b>41</b> which is used as the optical input to the apparatus. The CW input enters an optical power splitter <b>42</b> which in this example comprises a 1&#xd7;2 multimode interference (MMI) structure or device <b>42</b>. Hence, the MMI device <b>42</b> has a single input port and two output ports and operates to distribute the CW optical power received at the input port equally between the two output ports. The two output ports pass the CW power into two arms of a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) <b>43</b>, being a Mach-Zehnder interferometer configured to modulate an optical signal passed therethrough in the known manner, namely by the application of electrical drive signals to electrodes (not shown) acting on each arm of the MZM to differently modulate the phase of light propagating in that arm.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A first arm <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the MZM <b>43</b> receives an electrical drive signal <b>44</b><i>a </i>in the form of a clock signal <b>45</b><i>a </i>(that is, a signal comprising an oscillating voltage) with a period Ts, and a phase that we can designate as 0&#xb0; for the purposes of explanation. The second arm <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the MZM <b>43</b> receives an electrical drive signal <b>44</b><i>b </i>in the form of a clock signal <b>45</b><i>a </i>which again has a period Ts, in other words, the same period as the first clock signal <b>45</b><i>a</i>. However, the second clock signal <b>45</b><i>b </i>is arranged to be in antiphase with the first clock signal <b>45</b><i>a</i>, in other words, it has a phase of 180&#xb0;. A pair of equal and opposite clock signals such as these can be termed differential clock signals. The voltage of the clock signals is set so that the peak-to-peak differential voltage between the two arms, V<sub>ppd</sub>, is substantially equal to the half wave voltage (V&#x3c0;) of the MZM <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The outputs of the two arms <b>43</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the MZM <b>43</b> are coupled into the two input ports of a 2&#xd7;2 MMI device <b>46</b>. The action of the 2&#xd7;2 MMI <b>46</b> (described further below) is to pass all the light from both input ports to one or other of its output ports depending on the phase of the light in one input port relative to the light in the other input port. Hence, if this relative phase, or the phase difference, between the input ports can be suitably arranged, the total light in both input ports can be alternately switched between the two output ports. Overall, therefore, the total CW power level entering the 1&#xd7;2 MMI <b>42</b>, which is split equally between the two arms of the MZM <b>43</b>, can be recombined on an alternating and equal time basis at its original level between the two 2&#xd7;2 MMI outputs <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Hence, two output signals <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>are obtained which each comprise a sequence of pulses, corresponding to time slices from the original CW input, and each having the same power as the original CW power. However, the sequences are offset in time from one another (arising from the alternation of power at each output port <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b</i>); the time during which a pulse is present in one sequence corresponds to zero power (no pulse) in the other sequence. The sequences <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>are therefore differential, in common with the two clock signals <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. Each pulse in each sequence has a duration or pulse width of Ts/2, in other words, half the clock signal period Ts. This distribution of power between the two signals <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>makes ideal pulse sequences for OTDM; when combined, the pulses of the signals <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>will neatly interleave in the proposed manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, to create a multiplexed signal. Each signal <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>can therefore be used as an OTDM channel, by being amplitude modulated.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a computer simulation of such a multiplexed signal comprising two channels generated using apparatus of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The results of the simulation are represented as a graph of optical power against time, with both channels plotted. The differential clock signals for driving the MZM had a frequency of 50 GHz, producing a pulse width Ts/2 of about 10 ps. As can be appreciated, all pulses have substantially equal width, spacing (repetition rate) and amplitude. However, alternate pulses belong to different channels, A and B.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hence, the original optical input power can be substantially preserved in the output pulses, maximising the available range for amplitude modulation. Additionally, the proposed arrangement allows flexibility and tunability. If the clock signals for the MZM are generated from a tunable arrangement, their frequency can be altered as desired, which in turn alters the pulse duration of the channel pulses. Hence, bit rate flexibility is available.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this regard, limitations may arise between the electrical and optical bandwidths of the MZM, but suitable design of amplifiers for the electrical drive signals and of the modulator electrodes can provide matching over at least a narrow frequency range such as over about 10 GHz (such as 45 GHz to 55 GHz), offering some tunability. Resonant enhancement techniques such as inductor peaking and microwave stubs could be used to implement this.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> example apparatus, and also in other examples described below, MMI structures are structures which are used to provide the functions of optical power splitting and combining. To describe the operation of these structures in more detail, a 2&#xd7;2 MMI consists of two input single-mode waveguides followed by a multimode waveguide followed by two output single-mode waveguides. From the input single-mode waveguides and the multimode waveguide higher order modes are excited and propagate along the multimode waveguide, where interference then occurs between all the excited modes from the two ports. At certain lengths along the multimode waveguide this interference results in the self-imaging of the input light to two spots and the two single-mode output waveguides are positioned to coincide with the position of these spots. Assuming equal input power from the two input single-mode waveguides, the ratio of the total power to each of these spots (and therefore to the two output waveguides) is dependent on the relative phase of the light from the two input single-mode waveguides. A phase advance of &#x3c0;/2 to one of the input waveguides will result in all of the power exiting from one of the two output waveguides and a phase advance of &#x3c0;/2 to other input waveguide will result in all of the power exiting from the other output waveguide. The device therefore routes light to the two output waveguides depending on the relative phase of the light in the two input waveguides. In the presently proposed pulse generation scheme, utilising appropriate clock signals to drive a modulator that inputs to the MMI, the result is to allocate alternating portions of the input optical power received by the pulse generator between the two outputs, thereby dividing the input power into slices distributed sequentially to the two outputs. The MMI is just one example of a structure that can perform this function; other structures providing the same functionality may be used in place of MMIs in any of the disclosed examples. For example, directional couplers are also suitable.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a second example apparatus configured to generate multiple channels of optical pulses.

In 2016, a QVCO operating between 72 and 88 GHz based on a 28 nm CMOS process was reported [5]. In 2019, the frequency range of QVCO has been pushed to 93 to 104 GHz [6]. The effects of possible timing jitter should be taken into account for the scheme proposed herein. The current state-of-art in this area has pushed the root-mean-square (RMS) jitter to less than 0.3% of the clock period. In 2019 a PLL generating 28 to 31 GHz with a RSM jitter at 76 fs using a 65 nm CMOS process was reported [7].

Typically, pulse modulation is achieved by passing the train of pulses in a channel through an electro-optic modulator, and driving the modulator electrodes with one or more electrical drive signals carrying the desired data. There is no limitation of the format of modulator that can be used for this, in combination with apparatus configured to generate channels of pulses by slicing optical power in the time domain. For example, further MZMs could be used, or alternatively electro-absorption modulator (EAM) types, or ring modulator types, or metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP) types, or carrier depletion types, or carrier injection types, or other electro-optic modulator types known to the skilled person. Similarly, any appropriate material may be used for the modulator, such as silicon, group III-V semiconductors and lithium niobate.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A particularly useful approach is to use the clock source that is already utilised to generate the clock signals for driving the MZM(s) used in the pulse generation to additionally provide a trigger signal or trigger clock at the same frequency and phase to trigger the data-carrying electric drive signals (data stream) for the modulators for each corresponding pulse sequence or channel. by controlling the timing of the data streams in this way, the modulator drive signals can be interleaved with the same phase as the various pulse sequences so that the drive signals are appropriately matched in time to the pulses in each channel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">It may be that a small amount of delay mismatch may occur owing to the propagation time (delay) of the pulses from the pulse generation components to the pulse modulators.

An existing technique for this uses a continuous optical wave as an input to an electro-optic modulator. The electrodes providing modulation in the two arms of the modulator have a segmented design, comprising a series of electrode segments arranged in sequence along the length of the arms. The electrode segments are driven with signals carrying different binary inputs, as binary pulses, to be modulated onto the optical input. In order for each segment to modulate the correct part of the optical input, it is necessary to apply individual timing control functions to the drive signals for each segment, to delay the drive signals and match them to the arrival time of the optical input at that segment following its propagation delay from travelling along the modulator arm through the series of segments.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The presently proposed approach can allow the timing control to be dispensed with. A narrow optical pulse can be generated within a pulse sequence, as described above, and used as an input to the segmented modulator in place of the continuous wave input currently employed. The optical pulse will have a propagation time (delay) to travel through the modulator, passing the series of electrode segments. If the binary drive signals for the electrode segments are configured to have a pulse width which is greater than the propagation delay of the optical pulse, the optical pulse will coincide with the drive pulses of every electrode segment without any need for timing control. Hence, there is no need to match the optical and electrical delays so problems associated with delay matching are removed, and timing control functions for the drive signals can be eliminated from the device. Additionally, the wider pulse width of the electrical signals corresponds to a lower speed (frequency) for the electrical signals, which is a simpler design specification for both the driver modules and the modulator, which can be co-designed to operate at the lower speed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a simplified schematic configuration of an example segmented electro-optic modulator configured to operate in this way to modulate optical pulses.

As in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> example, a quadrature optical pulse generator is included, operable to generate four quadrature channels of interleaved optical pulses from three MZMs <b>43</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> on the photonics chip <b>254</b> driven with quadrature clock signals <b>45</b><i>a</i>, <b>45</b><i>b</i>, <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>from a clock generator <b>90</b> on the electrical chip. The optical CW input <b>41</b> to the pulse generator <b>206</b> has a constant power amplitude, so that the four pulse sequences <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b </i>comprise pulses of equal power, without modulation. Each pulse sequence is passed to a corresponding electro-optic modulator <b>254</b> on the photonics chip. While this is similar to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> arrangement, in this case the modulators <b>254</b> are driven via driver modules <b>256</b> on the electrical chip <b>252</b> which are provided with electrical analogue inputs <b>258</b> to be modulated onto the four channels of pulses, in place of the electrical digital data streams input for driving the modulators in the OTDM device. As before the drive modules <b>256</b> can be co-designed with their corresponding modulators <b>254</b> for optimised performance. The electrical analogue inputs <b>258</b> may reflect a single source or multiple correlated sources, to provide modulated voltage inputs <b>260</b>. Since the inputs <b>258</b> driving the modulators are analogue in this instance, there is no requirement to ensure synchronicity with the optical pulses and the drive modules <b>256</b> are not therefore triggered with clock signals from the clock generator <b>90</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The output from the modulators <b>254</b> are therefore four channels of time interleaved quadrature optical pulse sequences <b>54</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>54</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, <b>64</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>64</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, modulated to carry the electrical analogue inputs <b>258</b>. The conversion to digital signals is carried out in the same manner as in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> system. Hence, each channel of pulses is captured by a photodetector <b>214</b> on the photonics chip <b>254</b>, the electrical outputs of which are passed to transimpedance amplifiers <b>216</b> on the electrical chip <b>252</b>. The amplified electrical signals are delivered to corresponding ADCs <b>217</b> on the electrical chip for conversion to binary outputs which are received by a digital signal processor <b>218</b> also on the electrical chip. This delivers the final digital output <b>219</b> of the system <b>250</b>. As before, the ADCs <b>217</b> are triggered with the appropriate quadrature clock signals <b>100</b> from the clock generator <b>90</b> for proper timing with the pulse sequences.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As will be appreciated from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the photonic ADC system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> includes more components, so requires a greater chip area. Implementing the modulation to import the analogue signals after the pulse sequence generation rather than before requires more modulators, and hence introduces a higher overall optical loss. However, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> system offers the possibility that multiple correlated analogue inputs, one per optical channel, can be digitised with one single ADC device, compared to the single analogue input handled by the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> system. This may find application in radar systems, for example, in which &#x201c;multiple input multiple output&#x201d; (MIMO) techniques have been widely adopted.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Various experimental work has been carried out to demonstrate the practicality of the disclosed pulse generation technique and associated modulation methods. The production, in terms of fabrication and packaging, of commercially suitable optoelectronic devices and systems will require significant development work, but nevertheless it is possible to demonstrate the disclosed concepts with real devices. Therefore, a previously fabricated silicon modulator array on a chip has been used a core module component for proof of principle demonstrations. This silicon modulator chip, in which four individual MZMs are fabricated as an array, was wire-bonded onto a printed circuitry board (PCB). External electrical clocks and data streams were routed to the modulators via radio frequency (RF) tracks (grounded coplanar waveguide) on the PCB. RF losses in the PCB and parasitic effects introduced by the device packaging limited the modulators to operation up to a few Gb/s, which is nevertheless useful to allow proof of concept.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Three demonstrations were made: generation of differential optical pulses (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), generation of quadrature optical pulses (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and OTDM based on differential optical pulses (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of experimental apparatus configured to demonstrate the generation of differential optical pulses. An external 1 GHz differential clock signal <b>130</b> with a clock period of 1 ns was applied to drive a first MZM <b>132</b> with peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp) of about 5.0 V. An optical source <b>134</b>, in the form of a laser, output continuous wave optical power <b>135</b> at a wavelength of 1310 nm. This was passed through a polarising fibre <b>136</b> before being input to the MZM <b>132</b> via grating coupler <b>137</b> and a 1&#xd7;2 MMI <b>138</b>. After modulation in the MZM, the optical power leaves the MZM <b>132</b> via a 2&#xd7;2 MMI <b>140</b>, which, as described above, creates two output channels <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> of alternating optical pulses. Theoretically, these differential optical pulses are generated from the 2&#xd7;2 MMI simultaneously. However, only one input port of a digital communication analyser (DCA) was available, so the output waveforms, leaving the device via output grating couplers <b>141</b>, could be observed only at a time. The pulses leaving either grating coupler <b>141</b> were fed to the DCA <b>147</b> via an optical fibre <b>145</b> and an erbium doped fibre amplifier <b>146</b>. The results of observing each of the channels <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> as screen shoots from the DCA. Since they are observed individually, it is not possible to observe the relative timings of the pulses, so instead the observations focused on the shape and width of the optical pulses in each channel. As highlighted on the screen shots, the width of the observed optical pulses in each channel is exactly the same, namely 0.5 ns, which is half of the 1 ns clock period. This shows the functionality of the differential optical pulse generation.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of experimental apparatus configured to demonstrate the generation of quadrature optical pulses. The apparatus corresponds to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, with extended functionality to generate quadrature pulse from the differential pulses, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Once again, an external 1 GHz differential clock signal <b>130</b> with a 1 ns period was applied to the MZM <b>132</b> (now a first MZM) with a Vpp of about 5.0V. One of the output differential pulse sequences was extracted via an output grating <b>140</b> from the first MZM <b>132</b> and input via a fibre to a second 1&#xd7;2 MMI <b>150</b> and subsequent second MZM <b>152</b>. The second MZM <b>152</b> was driven using the same clock source, with the clock signal phase shifted by 90&#xb0; (one quarter of the clock cycle), in order to provide a quadrature clock signal <b>153</b>. The second MZM <b>152</b> output via a second 2&#xd7;2 MMI, the output ports of which, via output gratings <b>156</b>, delivered two quadrature optical pulse sequences <b>158</b> as previously described. The pulse sequence <b>158</b> from one output grating <b>156</b> was observed on the DCA, and a screen shot of the result is included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. Theoretical analysis of the quadrature generation process indicates that the width of the optical pulses from the second MZM <b>152</b> and second 2&#xd7;2 MMI <b>154</b> should be equal to one-quarter of the clock cycle. This is demonstrated in the screen shot, where a pulse width of 0.25 ns (one quarter of the 1 ns clock period) is indicated. The distorted shape of the observed quadrature optical pulses is not of concern, since it arises from a provision of only 3.5 Vpp from an RF amplifier utilized to drive the second MZM <b>152</b>; this was insufficient for the required modulation depth.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of experimental apparatus configured to demonstrate OTDM, based on the differential pulse sequences generated from the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. The apparatus corresponds to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, with extended functionality to perform OTDM. To achieve this, the apparatus was configured as in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> example, by adding the second MZM <b>152</b> at one of the differential pulse sequence outputs from the first MZM <b>132</b>. However, the second MZM <b>152</b> was driven with a drive signal representing a desired data stream, rather than with a quadrature clock signal as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, so as to operate as a modulator such as the modulators <b>78</b><i>a</i>, <b>78</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, rather than the quadrature-generating modulator in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. In order to generate the differential pulse sequences, the first MZM <b>132</b> was in this instance driven using a differential clock signal at 2 GHz, to give a clock period of 0.5 ns. This higher clock frequency gave a shorter differential pulse width, of 0.25 ns. Pulses of this duration comprised in one of the differential pulse sequences from the first 2&#xd7;2 MMI following the first MZM <b>132</b> were delivered to the second MZM <b>152</b> to undergo amplitude/power modulation. The second MZM was driven with electric drive signals <b>160</b> applied to its electrodes which carried a data stream or signal that could be triggered by the 2 GHz clock signal <b>130</b>, and hence having a bit rate of 2 Gb/s. The data stream drive signal <b>160</b> was synchronised with the clock signal <b>130</b> by aligning the rising edges of the two signals, to emulate the clock triggering arrangement described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> (wherein the clock signal used to generate the pulse sequences is also used to trigger the data streams applied to the modulators). The optical waveform obtained at one of the output grating couplers <b>156</b> of the second MZM <b>152</b>/second 2&#xd7;2 MMI <b>154</b> was observed on the DCA <b>147</b>. Screen shots of the results are included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. Theoretical analysis of the OTDM process indicates that the input data stream <b>160</b> should be modulated onto the differential optical pulses, the width of which is determined by the clock signal applied to the first MZM <b>132</b>. In this experiment, with a 2 GHz clock signal, the width of the differential optical pulses, and hence the pulse width in the modulated data stream, is expected to be 0.25 ns; this was observed, as highlighted on the screen shots. Also, the binary sequence of the input data stream, 10110001101, is clearly modulated onto the observed pulses shown in the upper screen shot.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Consequently, the principle described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> was demonstrated, namely that a &#x201c;full&#x201d; rate OTDM transmitter device can be built with each modulator in the device operating at half of that data rate.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">This experimental work was based on general discrete component at hand, for the purpose of proof of concept only. Neither the operation speed nor the signal integrity demonstrated correspond to those of modern optical communication links, but the demonstrated devices can be readily scaled and enhanced to provide performance up to and beyond current communications link operating parameters. As noted, devices to implement the described methods and techniques can fabricated by monolithic integration of electrical components into silicon photonics platforms or via three-dimensional packaging of optoelectronic systems.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Optical pulse generation in accordance with the method proposed herein can be understood with reference to the flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, which shows steps in a pulse generation method by which multiple channels of optical pulses can be generated. In step S<b>1</b>, an optical input in the form of continuous wave optical input with an optical power is provided. This may the output of a laser, for example. In many cases, the optical power of the optical input will be substantially constant, but for some applications such as the ADC demonstrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the optical power may be modulated in amplitude, for example to encode an analogue signal. In step S<b>2</b>, the continuous wave optical power of the optical input is divided into equal consecutive slices in the time domain. Each slice may be thought of an optical pulse, each slice or pulse being contiguous in time with the preceding and following slice or pulse. In step S<b>3</b>, the consecutive slices are allocated sequentially to two or more optical outputs. This allocation evenly distributes the slices across the outputs so that each output comprises a series or sequence of identical pulses at the same repetition rate, but with the timing of the pulses in each output offset or delayed with respect to the sequence(s) in the other output or outputs. Each sequence can be designated as a channel of optical pulses, suitable for modulation to carry data in a communications network, for example. In particular, the pulse timing in the sequences that arises from the sequential allocation of the slices between the channels means that the pulses are interleaved in time and the channels can be combined in a multiplexed manner with no timing overlap between the pulses of different channels.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">A variety of apparatus configurations for generating optical pulses of this form have been described herein, together with additional features for enabling applications such as digital to analogue conversion, analogue to digital conversion and optical time domain multiplexing. However, it is envisaged that other configurations of apparatus, comprising various photonic and electrical components and devices, may alternatively be used to generate pulses in accordance with a method as set out in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, in other words, by slicing a continuous wave optical power signal into consecutive parts, portions or slices for distribution across a plurality of channels, where each slice forms an optical pulse that preserves or substantially preserves the optical power level of the original continuous wave optical signal, thereby maximising the modulation depth available for modulating information on the pulses.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, the various pulse generators described herein in detail comprise Mach Zehnder modulators (MZMs). Other electro-optic modulators that achieve the same results as MZMs are known, and may be used instead as preferred. The various components may be differently distributed between one or more chips to produce a complete device, with individual chips integrated together in any known manner considered practical and convenient. While devices in a chip-based format are compact, robust and convenient, a device or apparatus configured to achieve the proposed pulse generation could be implemented to include one or more bulk optical or electrical components.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The example OTDM transmitters described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (two channel) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (four channel) were discussed in terms of identical modulation being applied to each channel in order to generate the multiplexed output. Electro-optic modulators are provided with driver modules configured to provide electric drive signals to the modulators, such that each driver module receives an external data stream comprising data to be modulated onto the first pulse sequence or channel.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">However, the transmitters are not limited in this regard. A particular benefit of the approach described herein is that different modulation techniques can be applied to different channels generated in the same OTDM device, and/or different data types can be modulated onto the different channels, without any impact on the ability to multiplex the channels and transmit the final output signal. All that is required are appropriate drive signals that can carry the desired data streams, and suitable modulators or signal processing units able to imprint or encode that data onto the optical pulses. In particular, it is possible to modulate individual channels in the same transmitter simultaneously with either digital signals or analogue signals. This is a highly beneficial flexibility enabled by the use of optical signals to carry the data. Similar electrical multiplexing systems, such as electrical serialisers/deserialisers (SERDES) are typically built from semiconductor logic gates (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS), for example) and are hence only able to handle binary information and are therefore limited to digital applications. Devices according to the present disclosure are not limited in this way, and both digital data and analogue data can be encoded onto the optical pulse sequences by use of suitable modulators. For example, the pulses of one channel can be modulated with a binary signal, pulses in another channel can be modulated with an analogue signal such as a radio frequency signal, and pulses in yet further channels can be modulated according to other modulation schemes such as pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Once individually modulated, the channels can be multiplexed and later demultiplexed free from interference with one another (channel cross-talk). This capability to handle different signal types and formats has the potential to greatly enhance and improve computing architecture; allowing the efficient routing of many signals, with reduced requirements for analogue-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analogue conversion. This is merely one example application, however, and the invention is not limited in this regard.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">An OTDM device as proposed herein can be thought of an optical serialiser (the serialising or multiplexing side of a SERDES system), and offers several advantages over conventional logic-gate based electrical serialisers. An electrical device typically suffers from latency induced by latch-up in the CMOS components; an optical system eliminates this. Higher throughput can be achieved in an optical arrangement compared with an electrical arrangement. The optical signals are immune to electromagnetic interference. Also, the use of optical signals gives compatibility with optical wavelength division multiplexing schemes.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">To fully implement SERDES or other schemes that transmit, convey or propagate the multiplexed signal, demultiplexing or deserialisation is required, wherein the multiplexed signal is received and demultiplexed or deserialised back into its individual component channels so that the data carried by the optical pulses in each channel can be extracted and utilised, or the pulses of any channel can be separately further conveyed elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows a schematic block diagram of a full optical multiplex and demultiplex or SERDES system according to an example of the current disclosure. From left to right, the system <b>300</b> comprises an optical pulse generation component or element <b>302</b>, a multiplexing component or element <b>304</b>, a routing component or element <b>306</b>, and a demultiplexing component or element <b>308</b>. The optical pulse generation component <b>302</b> may, for example, be configured to generate two channels of pulses as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> or the pulse generator <b>76</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, or four channels of pulses as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> or the pulse generator <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, or similarly but expanded with additional modulator stages to generate additional channels. The multiplexing component <b>304</b> receives the channels of optical pulses from the optical pulse generation component <b>302</b>, modulates the pulses of each channel to encode data therein, and combines the pulses from all the channels in a interleaved manner to create a multiplexed signal. It may be configured, for example, in line with the modulator part <b>78</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (two channels) or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (three channels), or expanded to handle more channels. The routing component <b>306</b> receives at an input end the optical multiplexed signal output by the multiplexing component <b>304</b> and propagates it to the intended destination, which may be nearby to the pulse generator <b>302</b> and multiplexer <b>304</b>, or remote therefrom. Propagation may be via one or more optical planar or channel waveguides formed in one or more chips, or via one or more optical fibres, or a combination of the two, depending on the application and the distance over which the multiplexed signal needs to be transmitted. An output end of the routing component <b>306</b> delivers the transmitted multiplexed signal to the demultiplexing component <b>308</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The components may be variously fabricated on one or more chips depending on the application.

This gives flexibility in locating the multiplexing and the demultiplexing functionality of the system <b>300</b>. The routing component <b>306</b> can be fabricated as required according to the type and distance of propagation, and optically coupled to the first chip <b>310</b> and the second chip <b>312</b>. In another example, all the components may be fabricated on single chip <b>314</b> in order to provide a monolithic optical SERDES system.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of an example of a component, element or device configured to perform demultiplexing or deserialisation of a multiplexed signal generated by OTDM as described herein, such as may be used in the demultiplexing component <b>308</b> in the optical SERDES system <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. In order to achieve successful demultiplexing or deserialisation of a multiplexed signal, it is generally considered appropriate to utilise a clock signal to retain the appropriate relative timings of the pulses belonging to the various channels. In electrical SERDES systems, this is achieved by encoding a clock signal or timing information into the data carried by the various channels, extracting this information during deserialisation, and using it to set the pulse timings in the channels. In the current arrangement, it is proposed to do the same. Accordingly, the multiplexing end of the system is configured to include clock data into the modulated optical pulses of each channel. The demultiplexer <b>308</b> an input, where the multiplexed signal <b>84</b> is received after routing, plus outputs where each of the individual signals is delivered in electrical form <b>332</b><i>a</i>-<b>332</b><i>d </i>after demultiplexing. Each output includes a clock and data recovery (CDR) module or circuit <b>320</b> which extracts the clock data from each demultiplexed signal and generates a relevant clock signal C for use in the demultiplexing. Alternatively, a single CDR circuit may be includes which is configured to generate multiple clock signals at the various different phases.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">For demultiplexing, a similar arrangement is employed to that used to generate the multiple channels of pulses from the original CW optical input, with the multiplexed signal <b>84</b> being treated as the CW input. Compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. Hence, the multiplexed signal <b>84</b> enters a first demultiplex module <b>322</b> comprising a 1&#xd7;2 MMI device that distributes the optical power of the multiplexed signal between two arms of a MZM, the outputs of which are passed through a 2&#xd7;2 MMI. However, in this instance, the arms of the MZM are driven each appropriately driven by a clock signal C from the CDR or CDRs in order to preserve the pulse timing of the multiplexed signal. Each output from the 2&#xd7;2 MMI is passed to another demultiplex module <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, again each comprising a 1&#xd7;2 MMI, a MZM and a 2&#xd7;2 MMI, with the arms of the MZM each also being appropriately driven by the clock signal C. The 2&#xd7;2 MMI each have two outputs, as before, each of which provides the optical pulses from one of the original channels <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>, <b>64</b><i>a</i>, <b>64</b><i>b</i>, the original pulse widths, spacing and modulation being preserved. In order to utilise the channels, the pulses of each are incident on a dedicated photodetector <b>330</b> each having an associated transimpedance amplifier <b>332</b> and configured to measure the power amplitude of each pulse. Since the amplitudes are determined by the modulation applied to the pulses in the original pulse generation and multiplexing stage, the data encoded by that modulation can be extracted from each channel, and delivered at the electrical outputs <b>332</b><i>a</i>-<b>332</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">An optical SERDES or multiplex/demultiplex system in line with the examples herein offers a variety of possible functionalities and benefits. It is attractive for use in computing architecture, for example. In conventional electronics-based computing architecture, data is transmitted and processed in the form of binary logic bits represented by 0 and 1; data is limited to this format. In a photonics-based system, on the other hand, data is transmitted and processed in the form of optical pulses, which can carry complex degrees of freedom, thereby removing restrictions created by binary bits. However, the devices described herein are additionally compatible with traditional binary signals (which are merely one of many data formats that can be carried by optical pulses), offering a smooth transition between electrical and optical devices and systems.
