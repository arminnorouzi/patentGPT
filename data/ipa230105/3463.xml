The present disclosure relates to the development of innovative SMART system technologies of the SMART innovative technology development project (R&#x26;D) with support from the National Research Foundation of Korea, which was funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT. The Project Serial Number of the national R&#x26;D project supporting the present disclosure is 1711129153, the Project number is 2020M2D7A1079178, the contribution rate is 1/1, the project performing organization is Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), and the research was performed from Jan. 1, 2021 to Dec. 31, 2021.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a printed circuit heat exchanger may be supplied with a first fluid of relatively high temperature and a second fluid of a relatively low temperature and perform heat exchange between the first fluid and the second fluid. The printed circuit heat exchanger may be manufactured by processing a mini-channel structure in a metal plate through chemical etching, then stacking plates, and performing diffusion bonding. Printed circuit heat exchangers are being used in various industries due to high heat exchange density in the mini-channel structure. Mini-channels formed in a plate may have a semicircular or rectangular cross-section with some vertices rounded.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, as a width of a mini-channel formed in a plate increases, a surface area between the first fluid and the second fluid may increase, thereby increasing heat transfer efficiency of a printed circuit heat exchanger. In addition, as the width of the mini-channel formed in the plate increases, a flow velocity of a fluid is reduced, thereby reducing a pressure loss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there is a problem in that when some plates with mini-channels each having a large width are diffusion-bonded, pressure is not applied to some positions in the plates, so the plates may not be bonded sufficiently.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED DOCUMENT</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">(Patent Document 1) Korean Patent No. 10-1624561 (Registered on May 20, 2016)</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above, the present disclosure provides a printed circuit heat exchanger and a method of manufacturing a printed circuit heat exchanger in which a flow path through which a fluid flows can be formed to have a large width.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also provides a printed circuit heat exchanger and a method of manufacturing a printed circuit heat exchanger in which diffusion bonding is possible even when a flow path of a large width is formed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a heat exchanger including: a first flow path member including a first plate having a first flow path portion providing a plurality of flow paths through which a first fluid flows, and a first bonding plate diffusion-bonded to the first plate to cover the first flow path portion; and a second flow path member including a second plate having a second flow path portion providing a plurality of flow paths through which a second fluid for exchanging heat with the first fluid flows, wherein the first flow path member and the second flow path member are diffusion-bonded to each other.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a second aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of manufacturing a heat exchanger, including: a flow path portion processing step in which a flow path portion through which a fluid flows is formed in a plurality of plates; a flow path member forming step in which at least one of the plurality of plates and a bonding plate are diffusion-bonded to form a plurality of flow path members; and a heat exchanger forming step in which the plurality of flow path members are diffusion-bonded.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, since a connection flow path having a large fluid flow area can be formed on the plate, it is possible to increase heat transfer efficiency and reduce a pressure loss.
