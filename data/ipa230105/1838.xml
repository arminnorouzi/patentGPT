Typically, excavators are transported by trailer, whilst any attachments may be transported by trailer also, or transported separately by another vehicle. Often heavy and expensive, excavator attachments may cause damage if improperly secured in transit, and may be vulnerable to theft. Accordingly, attachments may be secured to a trailer using tie-down straps or similar, or users may transport attachments inside another vehicle, such as a van. Securing attachments in this way to trailers may be time consuming and vulnerable to human error, whilst loading attachments into a van may be impractical or unsafe for larger attachments. Additionally, it may be necessary to move attachments from a trailer or van to a more secure storage location after transport.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some of these issues have been addressed in part by trailers equipped with features for securing attachments. These trailers may have an integrated cage or locker for receiving attachments, such that attachments can be enclosed and locked in place on the trailer.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides further improvements in transporting excavators and excavator attachments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of the invention provides a container for retaining an excavator attachment on a trailer, the container comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a lower portion including a base, a pair of opposing end walls, and a front wall;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">a lid connected to the lower portion and arranged to pivot between a first position, in which the container may receive an excavator attachment, and a second position, in which the excavator attachment is retained by the container; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">a coupling configured to secure the container to a trailer such that the end walls of the lower portion are adjacent side walls of the trailer and the front wall of the lower portion is adjacent a front wall of the trailer,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">wherein a depth of the lid, in a direction perpendicular to the base of the container, is greater than a depth of the lower portion.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">Preferably the depth of the lid is more than twice the depth of the lower portion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">In preferred embodiments the coupling comprises a flange extending from the front wall of the lower portion.
