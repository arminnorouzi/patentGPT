This could be done, for example, to reduce the bandwidth required to represent the signal, reduce decoding complexity, fit the characteristics of a certain display device etc. The resolution of the signal could also be specified in a variety of domains/dimensions. In the case of a video signal, such could include, spatial (i.e., horizontal and vertical) resolution, temporal resolution, bit-depth, and even stereo information among others. In many cases, resolution in one dimension can be compromised in favor of another, e.g. in the case of interlace video signals, spatial resolution is sacrificed in favor of temporal resolution. For 3D applications, one compromise is to downsample spatially, using a variety of arrangements, and then multiplex the available stereo views. Downsampling can be horizontal, vertical, or even quincunx based, while the data can be packed or interleaved together, i.e. using checkerboard multiplexing.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present inventors have realized that current methods for reconstruction of downscaled or otherwise compromised video and other data can be severely limited in performance, or constrained in terms of complexity, given that the conversion process has little or no information about the original nature and characteristics of the content.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various embodiments, the present invention provides for the reconstruction of a downscaled or otherwise compromised video or other data back to it's original, or even a higher/different resolution or format. For example, a 720p (1280&#xd7;720) resolution video may be (or may need to be) upconverted to a 1080p (1920&#xd7;1080) resolution for display on a higher resolution display. Similarly, a 3D signal comprising of two quincunx sampled views multiplexed in a checkerboard arrangement or a 3D signal comprising of two horizontally or quincunx sampled views packed in a side by side arrangements may have to be upconverted to two full resolution 3D views or a different sampling arrangement such as line by line.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary quincunx sampling technique, where, for example, a full resolution image <b>905</b> (e.g., a left view of a stereographic image pair) is operated on by a filter/function/conversion f(x) <b>920</b> and then quincunx sampled by sampler <b>930</b>. The result is a sample pattern that is, for example, as illustrated at <b>940</b>. The sample pattern (of pixel data) may then be multiplexed with another quincunx sampled image (e.g., right view of the stereoscopic pair) or possibly another view or even an unrelated image, and then encoded. The process can also be applied to images using a different sampling and packing method, such as horizontal sampling with side by side packing, or vertical sampling with line by line or over under packing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conversion process can be done using a variety of algorithms, including any one or more of, for example, separable or non-separable filters, edge adaptive interpolation methods etc, which, in various embodiments, may also require the analysis and characterization of the signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustration of an interpolator for quincunx sampled data according to an embodiment of the present invention. The process is similar to other sampling and packing methods. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a bitstream <b>1005</b> is provided to a decoder <b>1050</b> that decodes a sampled image <b>1080</b> (quincunx sampled image in this example), which is then applied to each of a series of filter operations <b>1085</b>. The filter operations <b>1085</b> may include any temporal, spatial or other upconversion process or any other processes described herein for any type of up-conversion, error correction, color correction, or general improvement of the sampled image.

In particular, in the case of a video, for a region R<sub>0 </sub>with low texture characteristics algorithm A<sub>0 </sub>may behave better and result in better image quality for, e.g., scaling than algorithm A<sub>1</sub>, while A<sub>1 </sub>may behave better and result in better image quality for a different region R<sub>1</sub>. Although a decoder may try to determine which algorithm may perform better given the characteristics of the region or even given the characteristics of the converted regions given algorithms A<sub>0 </sub>and A<sub>1</sub>, this process can be too complex and too time consuming to perform. Furthermore, given the fact that the decoder only has limited information about the image/video, performance is always bounded by the available information. This can considerably limit the performance of such a scheme.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In various embodiments, the present invention assists the decoder or post-processor by providing additional information which can dictate which algorithm, algorithms, or algorithm groups/classes it should use to process each different region. This is done by analyzing and evaluating each algorithm and its performance or/and characteristics at before (e.g. using a pre-processor), during or after the encoding process, rating the behavior of each algorithm given the application, and then selecting and signaling the appropriate algorithm, and any related parameters, for each region.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Signaling can be done within the bitstream (or data stream) itself (e.g., including signals or metadata in the bitstream) or could be signaled as side information (e.g. as a metadata file or stream). At the decoder, the recommended processing information about each region can be decoded and the appropriate algorithm or algorithms selected, contained in, or identified in the signals or metadata is used for performing the necessary operation or operations that may be predetermined or also identified in the signals or metadata.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that in the present invention, the decoder can be configured to maintain control over the algorithms utilized. For example, a decoder or post-processor may not always be obligated to use the selected or identified algorithm or class of algorithms, and may choose to disregard or select similar algorithms depending on circumstances (such as, for example, availability of certain algorithms and/or cost to implement). Furthermore, the decoder or post-processor may select to partially &#x201c;ignore&#x201d; the recommended algorithm, e.g. A<sub>0</sub>, and instead use a different algorithm, e.g. A<sub>1</sub>. A<sub>1 </sub>may have similar properties with A<sub>0</sub>, but might be less complicated, or may be known to have better performance. It is also possible that maybe A<sub>0 </sub>is not available or not known, in which case the decoder or post-processor may wish to use a default algorithm, e.g. A<sub>D</sub>, which is predefined by the system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Region Signaling</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">At the pre-processor and/or the encoder stage each algorithm or each algorithm class is preferably evaluated before signaling. Evaluation can be done at a region level, where a region can be any portion of the bitstream. For example, in a video bitstream, the region may be the entire sequence or image, a sub-sequence/video scene, a stereo frame pair or a single frame/view, including sub-sampled views, or sub-regions in an image. Sub-regions in an image could have a regular (e.g. triangular, rectangular etc) or irregular/random shape, can be of any size (e.g. 8&#xd7;8, 32&#xd7;32, 4&#xd7;64 etc), and can even extend temporally (e.g. an object tracked in time) or in space (e.g. an object in 3D space).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Regions could also be considered using sub-sampling, especially in the case of sub-sampled and multiplexed data as is the scenario of quincunx sampled and checkerboard multiplexed video data for 3D stereo delivery. Regions could also be predefined, e.g. by a user. For example, an entire sequence can be identified as a single region, or a region could specify a collection of N subsequent frames such as in the case of a fixed Group of Pictures (GOP) of size N.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Regions may comprise, for example, a spatial regional segmentation used for processing to determine signaling for that segment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, M&#xd7;K rectangular regions of equal size (width/M)&#xd7;(height/K) where width is the width and height is the height of the frame respectively can also be used. A user may even specify that all individual pixels, or even all individual samples (e.g. separating luma and chroma samples) that correspond to a region.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Other combinations may also be utilized, including, for example, grouping together co-located samples in a stereo pair, a cuboid of size M&#xd7;K&#xd7;N where now N corresponds to temporal samples, etc. Regions may also be adaptively selected and defined and basically be of an arbitrary shape. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, adaptively defined regions A<sub>0</sub>-A<sub>4 </sub>are illustrated. In various embodiments, regions can be selected using one or more of a variety of algorithms such as scene cut detection, image/video segmentation, object tracking, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Algorithms for segmentation may include techniques using edge detection, watershed methods, the haursdorff distance, K-means, and could also consider motion detection/estimation and analysis. Motion estimation may be done using a variety of algorithms and models including affine, parabolic, translational among others, and could be block or region based, done in the spatial or frequency domain (e.g. using phase correlation) etc.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention does not restrict the application of other algorithms for the determination of such regions. Regions may also be classified given their illumination and chroma characteristics, texture, or be based on semantic information and user interaction. A combination of arbitrary shaped and regular shaped regions could also be used. For example, a region could be of fixed temporal length N but its spatial shape may change for every frame.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a region may also be further separated, in sub-regions. In this scenario, a system may specify first a set of primary regions (e.g., similar to the concept of a Macroblock in a video coding system), to which a particular processing method needs to be applied, while the same region can be, optionally, further separated into smaller sub-regions for which different parameters for the processing method can be used (e.g. the same algorithm but with a different strength filter or different thresholds). Regions may also overlap, in which case multiple algorithms can be applied to overlapping areas which can then be combined. Combining could be done after processing using simple averaging, or could be based on a weighted averaging method that could be based on the distance of the pixel from the center of each region, the characteristics and expected performance of the algorithm and the characteristics of the overlapping pixels or regions. In one embodiment, different algorithms are applied in a specified order to each region including the overlapped area.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the regions are predefined, there is no need to encode any information about their characteristics (e.g. shape, size, overlap etc). However, if these are not predefined, then it is required that such information is encoded and is available to the decoder. Encoding is not necessarily complex, especially for regularly shaped regions and can include information such as, for the case of a cuboid number of horizontal (M), vertical (K), and temporal (N) segments, or be more complicated such as using a vector or raster based description of the regions. For example, all regions could be described using the computer graphics metafile file format (CGM), the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format, Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) or Windows Metafile (WMF), or other vector graphics formats. Similarly, for a raster based description, we could use TIFF or BMP, JPEG, JPEG-2000, or even video codec representations using MPEG-2 or H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. In these scenarios prediction, both spatial and temporal, for representing the regions can be used. Both lossless and lossy representations could be considered where in the lossy case a different algorithm may inadvertently be used. However, if this process is done carefully and is known in the encoder, then this would not result in any issues especially if any processing is performed iteratively. In both vector and raster representations, the representation can be kept in a high resolution or could be subsampled down to 1&#xd7;1 sample.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In various embodiments an image can be characterized and represented by multiple region representations/maps, which may or may not be related, with each representation relating to a different post/interpolation process that needs to be applied onto the image. For example, one region representation can specify spatial up-sampling, a second region representation can specify temporal up-sampling/frame rate conversion, while a third one can specify de-blocking or de-noising. The sequence of which process should be performed first may depend on the order of the representations as they are found in the bitstream, or could be described within the bitstream itself with additional syntax. For example, in the above scenario we can signal to perform first the spatial up-sampling followed by temporal up-sampling and then de-blocking, or we can signal that de-blocking should be performed first, followed by spatial up-sampling, and then temporal up-sampling.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Analysis and Filter Selection</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present invention may be configured to signal a variety of post-processing methods including the preferred/recommended spatial or temporal up-scaling or downscaling method and its parameters, de-blocking, and de-noising among others, or even suggested (non-normative) simplifications in the decoding process and recommended methods for performing error concealment. The method and parameters to be signaled for a region can be selected in a variety of ways. In particular, the parameters could be fixed (e.g. the same method M<sub>0 </sub>for the entire sequence or for regions A<sub>0 </sub>in all frames, while method M<sub>1 </sub>is used for regions A<sub>1</sub>), changed periodically (e.g. every N frames method M<sub>0 </sub>in the above example is switched to method M<sub>0,N</sub>), or could be adaptive given certain properties of the signal or given user input. In one embodiment, the method is selected given the texture, edge, illumination, color, and motion characteristics of a scene. As an example, in a high textured region a &#x201c;softer&#x201d; de-blocking method and parameters can be signaled, while in a low textured region a different, more aggressive de-blocker and parameters can be signaled instead. Similarly, in a region characterized by vertical edges an interpolation method that is more biased towards the vertical direction could be signaled, while in a region with diagonal edges, an interpolation method biased diagonally can be used instead.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a different example, for a scene with low motion, a motion compensated method could be signaled for temporal interpolation, while for high motion, frame replication or frame blending can be used. This decision requires an analysis process to be performed prior to the decision. The analysis can be performed with a variety of methods, such as texture analysis (e.g. variance based or frequency analysis), using a motion estimation method including methods such as affine, parabolic, and translational (e.g. block based) motion estimation, and illumination change characterization among others.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an alternative embodiment, the decision can be performed using a distortion and/or complexity analysis of each method. The method that results in the lowest distortion and/or complexity can be selected as the method to be signaled. In particular, in an up-conversion example such as 720p to 1080p, or horizontally sampled and Side by Side multiplexed or quincunx sampled and checkerboard multiplexed 3D video data to a full resolution stereo pair, all available up-sampling filters are tested for every region. The filter that results in an up-converted region that resembles as closely as possible to the original up-converted signal and, optionally, requires the least or a desired complexity for the conversion, is selected for signaling.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The structure of a distortion/complexity based model is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, where an input source <b>505</b> is processed through a format conversion <b>510</b>, an encoder <b>540</b>, and then a decoder <b>550</b>. The decoded stream is then divided into regions and each region is forwarded to a set of filters <b>565</b> (e.g., filter <b>1</b> . . . N) (Region Selection <b>560</b>). The Region Selection <b>560</b> may contain one or more algorithms for regionally dividing the decoded stream including predetermined regions and/or adaptively determined regions including any based on regional brightness, contrast, edges, motion, and/or others. After filtering a distortion and/or complexity analysis is performed <b>570</b>. The distortion analysis may be the same or tailored for each filter type. The filter selection mechanism <b>530</b> then evaluates the results of the distortion/complexity analysis for each region. The best match based on a distortion/complexity selection criterion is then provided to the encoder <b>540</b> for production of the output bitstream <b>575</b>. The selected best match is illustrated as being placed and/or encoded into the output bitstream <b>575</b>, but may be provided in other mechanisms (not shown), including side information and/or metadata related to the output bitstream <b>575</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The selection can be based on distortion, e.g. compared to the original, but also jointly on rate, distortion, and even complexity of the method. The rate can include the bits that may be required to signal the method and its parameters, assuming that the encoding of the method may consider compression (e.g. prediction and entropy coding). Rate may also account for the bits of the actual video signal since it might be possible to consider multiple alternative representations of the same signal which may require different number of bits.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Different methods, as specified by this invention, may be appropriate for the different representations. In this scenario an encoder may select both the best representation (given a joint rate, distortion, and complexity criterion), but also the best post-processing method jointly. Distortion may be based on one or more of a variety of metrics, such as the Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD), Sum of Square Errors (SSE), or other metrics including subjective evaluation. Distortion could also be based on measuring a variety of characteristics of the image after post-processing, including blockiness, variance, frequency characteristics, image/texture sharpness, edge quality, or through the detection and measurement of artifacts that may have been created due to the usage of a particular method etc. Such measurements can be very useful in scenarios where the original content might not be available or is available but only at a different, i.e. lower, resolution or format. As an example, consider an up-conversion of a 30p signal to a 60p signal (increase frame rate by 2&#xd7;). In this scenario, detection of temporal artifacts can be very useful to determine the best method to signal for every frame or region. In one embodiment, the present invention utilizes at least one of a quantity and a quality of detected temporal artifacts caused by various methods to select which of the methods or classes of methods are signaled.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Selecting the best method could be done using a full search approach, i.e. test all available processing methods compared to the original or given the available evaluation metrics applicable to this process. However, fast methods could also be considered which can considerably reduce complexity. In particular, instead of testing all possible methods for processing a region, an analysis of a region and given its characteristics may be used to provide guidance on a selection of methods that are appropriate for testing for that region. For example, for frame rate conversion, the invention may first perform a simple motion estimation process, and given the motion information determine if it is needed or necessary to test any temporal (motion compensated), motion adaptive, or only basic methods such as frame blending or frame replication. Motion estimation could consist of a block based scheme such as the Enhanced Predictive Zonal Search (EPZS) algorithm, or could just rely on a simple frame/region difference.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an evaluation and selection of an image region according to an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>1110</b>, an image or video is segmented into regions. The regions are predetermined or determined based on any of the techniques described herein. A loop <b>1120</b> is set up to iteratively examine each region (<b>1120</b>), and parameters are initialized (step <b>1130</b>). For each of a plurality of algorithms, methods, or processes, a second loop is set up (<b>1140</b>). For each region, each algorithm/method/process is performed to determine the best mode or result(s). In this example, a distance function (dist) is computed (step <b>1150</b>) and compared to previously computed dist functions (step <b>1160</b>). The best algorithm for each region may be saved and then provided for encoding or a best algorithm across all regions may be provided for encoding (e.g., steps <b>1170</b> and <b>1195</b>).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The characteristics of neighboring regions, including the methods selected for these regions, if already known, could also be considered to speed up the process. If, for example, the regions on the left and above have selected method A<b>0</b> then it is very likely that also this method might be appropriate for the current region. Therefore, in various embodiments, the invention includes prioritization of likely methods when testing, or the consideration and update of a distortion threshold, which can be based on the neighboring regions and can be used to test if this mode or method should also be considered for the current region. Alternatively, a pattern of shifting parameters in known regions may also be recognized and used to predict a slightly different set of parameters for a current region to be tested.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The process may also prioritize first all other similar methods to A<b>0</b>. Similar considerations can be made if the neighboring regions have used different processing methods. In this scenario, all methods used in the neighboring regions can be considered as being more probable than other available methods. Probability can change given also the characteristics of the region and the relationship of the characteristics of this region with its neighbors. For example, if the region is highly textured, then it is likely that it will have more correlation with neighbors, temporal or spatial, with also similar texture. The higher the similarity with the neighbors (motion, texture, color etc), the higher the probability that also the processing method that should be applied should be the same or at least similar.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment, the method used is applied after decoding of a compressed signal, selection can be based on an open loop architecture. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, given only the original signal and the effect each method would have on that signal. As illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> example, an Input Source <b>305</b> undergoes a format conversion <b>310</b>. Such conversion may be for example, a horizontal or a quincunx sampling and side by side or checkerboard packing of a pair of stereographic images. The conversion is or may be regionally or otherwise segmented. A region is selected (e.g., region selection <b>320</b>), and each region in turn (or in parallel) is applied to series of filters (or methods, algorithms, or processes) (e.g., filters <b>1</b> . . . N). The filter having one of the highest quality, least cost, or predetermined combination of both or other factors is then selected and provided to the encoder <b>340</b> where the selection is provided as either a signal encoded (or placed) in the output bitstream <b>345</b> or provided as side information (not shown) related to the output bitstream <b>345</b>. The signal may contain, for example, the selected filter, an identifier of the filter, or an identifier of a class or category of filters that help convert the signal to its original (e.g. full resolution) or other format.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another embodiment, selection is based on a closed loop architecture (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In a closed loop architecture, selection is based on the performance of the method given the actual decoded signal, which commonly results in improved performance compared to an open loop system. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an input source <b>405</b> is processed through a format conversion <b>410</b>, an encoder <b>440</b>, and then a decoder <b>450</b>. The decoded stream is then divided into regions and each region is forwarded to a set of filters <b>465</b> (e.g., filter <b>1</b> . . . N) (Region Selection <b>460</b>). The Region Selection <b>460</b>, may contain one or more algorithms for regionally dividing the decoded stream including predetermined regions and/or adaptively determined regions including any based on regional brightness, contrast, edges, motion, and/or others. The filter selection mechanism then compares each region after decoding and filtering to a corresponding region in the original input. The best match based on a selection criteria is then provided to the encoder <b>440</b> for production of the output bitstream <b>455</b>. The selected best match is illustrated as being placed and/or encoded into the output bitstream <b>455</b>, but again, may be provided in other mechanisms such as, for example, metadata or side information (not shown) related to the output bitstream <b>455</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The signaling can specify specific filters or methods. It can also, however specify a class/type of filters or methods which can provide further flexibility to a decoder or post-processor. For example, instead of signaling that a separable filter with specific coefficients is used for up-conversion of the image, the system can specify that any separable filter or a separable filter of a certain length and above or below would result in acceptable performance. The decoder or post-processor is then free to select which filter to use, given complexity or availability.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">If a filter is not available, then a decoder/post-processor may also have the option to select the method that is the most similar one to the method signaled (e.g. for the separable filter example, a non-separable filter of the same length), or use a previously defined &#x201c;default&#x201d; filter that is specified in the system. The decoder/post-processor, can also select the method or completely ignore the metadata information given other characteristics of the process or the device. In particular, given power/battery status of the device, the system may select to use a higher or a lower complexity algorithm.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In fact, the present invention may also be structured to also signal the metadata alternative modes that can be used given power, or complexity footprints of a device. For example, the present invention may include embedding a number of alternative maps in the signal (e.g., 2 or more). Each alternative map targeting a different device (e.g. one map for a high definition LCD TV, another for a Plasma, another for a PC, an iPod or iPhone etc), and battery status. The device can detect its corresponding map, i.e. using a signature in the metadata that specifies the device, and perform its corresponding and optimized processing. It is apparent that for the encoding system, all devices need to be considered during the optimization and method selection process.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of metadata based post-processor according to an embodiment of the present invention.

The metadata extractor <b>770</b> extracts a signal identifying the previously selected or preferred decoder, which is used to select an appropriate output from the series of decoding mechanisms <b>720</b>. The previously selected decoder may be a specific decoder or a type of decoder, and the decoder output ultimately selected for the output bitstream <b>785</b> may be the decoder previously selected, a decoder of a same class or type, an equivalent decoder, a generic decoder, or a decoder optimized with parameters selected to alter performance of the decoder to more closely match the previously selected decoder, or others.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">It may be desirable, for some applications, to retain or alter the metadata information after processing, re-encoding, and trans-coding of the image data. In particular, if the content is rescaled and then re-encoded, the metadata could be retained as is, or adjusted given the scaling applied but also the characteristics of the encoding (e.g. quantization parameters and performance of motion estimation and compensation) and artifacts introduced by this process. This can reduce the complexity of reevaluating the performance of the available processing methods. The characteristics of the recommended methods for post-processing in the original signal can also provide hints in the secondary encoding on whether any additional but also which type of post-processing may be applied at a subsequent decoder.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram of an exemplary decoder <b>800</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.
