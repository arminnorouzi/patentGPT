Electric control valves include electromagnetic reversing valves, proportional reversing valves, proportional pressure regulating valves, etc. When the hydraulic pneumatic system fails, first confirm whether the electric control signal is normal in line with the troubleshooting steps from simple to difficult. Blind disassembly and replacement of hydraulic components will not only prolong the downtime and waste effort, but also has the risk of polluting the hydraulic system. When confirming whether the electric control signal is normal, the plug is usually unplugged and whether the electrical signal on the plug is normal is measured separately. This detection method has a great possibility of misjudgment, such as poor contact between the plug and the terminal of the valve; although the control signal is output to the plug, the valve is not energized.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure provides an electric control valve detection plug.
