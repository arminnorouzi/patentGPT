Shake caused by holding with a hand or walking when taking pictures and recording videos causes image blur, so that image quality is drastically reduced. This requires an anti-shake stabilization system to be equipped for cameras of the mobile phones, to compensate for an image shift during shake.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, in traditional anti-shake technologies, when shake occurs, a shift during shake is compensated by panning or tilting a lens assembly. When the lens assembly is panned or tilted, a lens moves or tilts relative to a photosensitive chip. Optically, an imaging circle of the lens is required to be larger than a chip to cover an imaging area of the chip when the lens moves or tilts relatively, which requires a diameter of the lens to be designed to be relatively large. When the lens assembly is tilted, because the lens is inclined relative to the chip, the focus of surrounding molding is not on a molding surface, which causes blur around the image.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides an anti-shake mechanism, a camera apparatus, and an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following technical solutions are used in the embodiments of the present disclosure:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides an anti-shake mechanism, including:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a support plate;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a first printed circuit board;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a support column fixedly installed on the first printed circuit board, where an end of the support column away from the first printed circuit board contacts the support plate;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a tilt angle detection mechanism, configured to detect a tilt angle of the support plate;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">an angle adjustment mechanism, where the angle adjustment mechanism is located between the support plate and the first printed circuit board, and is connected to the support plate and the first printed circuit board, respectively; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a driving apparatus connected to the tilt angle detection mechanism and the angle adjustment mechanism, respectively, where the driving apparatus receives a tilt angle collected by the tilt angle detection mechanism, and drives, according to the tilt angle, the angle adjustment mechanism to enable the support plate to rotate around the support column.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure further provides a camera module, including: the anti-shake mechanism according to the foregoing embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a third aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure further provides an electronic device, including: the camera module described in the foregoing embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the foregoing solutions of the present disclosure, through the support plate, the first printed circuit board, and the support column fixedly installed on the first printed circuit board, where an end of the support column away from the first printed circuit board contacts the support plate; the tilt angle detection mechanism configured to detect the tilt angle of the support plate; and the angle adjustment mechanism located between the support plate and the first printed circuit board and connected to the support plate and the first printed circuit board, respectively, and the driving apparatus connected to the tilt angle detection mechanism and the angle adjustment mechanism, respectively, where the driving apparatus receives the tilt angle collected by the tilt angle detection mechanism, and drives, according to the tilt angle, the angle adjustment mechanism to drive the support plate to rotate around the support column, this way, the anti-shake mechanism with the foregoing structure has good universality, and can be matched with different camera modules, and the camera module can be integrally installed on the anti-shake mechanism.

Because the camera module can be installed on the anti-shake mechanism integrally, tilt due to hand shake is compensated by tilting the entire camera module. That is, a lens and a chip in the camera module are tilted in an opposite direction together to achieve optical image stabilization. The lens does not move or tilt relative to the chip, so that better image quality and a larger anti-shake angle can be provided. In addition, optical design for the lens is easier, and a diameter of the lens can be smaller, which is not affected by a user's hand shake.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the tilt angle detection mechanism includes: a magnetic element <b>4</b>, where the magnetic element <b>4</b> is fixed to a side of the support plate <b>1</b> close to the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>; and a Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) angle sensor <b>5</b>, where the TMR angle sensor <b>5</b> is fixed to the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>, and the TMR angle sensor <b>5</b> is configured to sense an angle of a magnetic induction line of the magnetic element <b>4</b>.

A current in the SMA wire <b>7</b> is adjusted, so that a target SMA wire in the SMA wire <b>7</b> shrinks, to drive the support plate <b>1</b> to rotate around the support column <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, there may be one, four, or five SMA wires.

Exemplarily, in a case that the angle adjustment mechanism includes four SMA wires, the target SMA wire may be any SMA wire in the four SMA wires, and may be four SMA wires or any two SMA wires, which can be determined according to an actual situation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the angle adjustment mechanism includes: at least one spring plate <b>6</b>. The spring plate <b>6</b> is located between the support plate <b>1</b> and the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>, and is connected to the support plate <b>1</b> and the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be noted that a function of the spring plate <b>6</b> is to support the support plate <b>1</b> stably in a non-working state. An initial state of the spring plate <b>6</b> has certain elastic deformation, that is, a pre-tension force pulls the support plate <b>1</b> down, that is, pulls the support plate <b>1</b> toward a direction close to the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>, so that the center of the support plate <b>1</b> is against the support column <b>3</b>. Therefore, the support plate <b>1</b> can rotate around a rotation pivot of the support column <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a material of the spring plate <b>6</b> is copper alloy.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, one end of the SMA wire <b>7</b> is welded with the spring plate <b>6</b> connected to the support plate <b>1</b>, and the other end of the SMA wire <b>7</b> is welded with the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>. One end of the spring plate <b>6</b> is welded with the first printed circuit board <b>2</b>, that is, a current path of the SMA wire <b>7</b> can be formed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that an initial state of the SMA wire <b>7</b> is loose. According to the principle of the SMA, when shake of a camera module is detected by a gyroscope, the anti-shake mechanism is enabled, and a current is introduced into the SMA wire <b>7</b>, and a target SMA wire in the SMA wire <b>7</b> shrinks and shortens to generate a pulling force, so as to pull the support plate <b>1</b> to rotate around the rotation pivot. Therefore, anti-shake can be implemented for the camera module.
