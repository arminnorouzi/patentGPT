The present disclosure furthermore relates to an apparatus for performing a method of this kind.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sheet-metal parts occur in a wide variety of products in a wide variety of geometries. To produce products containing sheet-metal parts, the sheet-metal parts are cut from a large metal sheet, singularized, deburred, bent, joined, coated and/or assembled.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The sheet-metal parts are produced in what are known as jobs. A job includes:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">i) the production of one cut-out, singularized, bent and/or assembled sheet-metal part; or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">ii) the production of multiple cut-out, singularized, bent and/or assembled sheet-metal parts<br/>by a predefined production deadline.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0006" num="0007">The individual sheet-metal parts should be cut out from the metal sheet so that as little remaining material (scrap) from the metal sheet as possible is left as waste. Since the sheet-metal parts for different jobs may have different geometries, it may be advantageous, for the purpose of scrap optimization, to provide for sheet-metal parts for different jobs together on one metal sheet to save space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0008">However, the resultant mingling of jobs over time increases the complexity for production scheduling. On top of this, production of the sheet-metal parts may be carried out on multiple identical or similar production machines. By way of example, there may be provision for multiple identical or similar bending machines for bending the singularized sheet-metal parts. The production machines should be operated at as high a capacity as possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">Production scheduling, that is to say the scheduling of when which sheet-metal part is machined on which production machine, becomes very complex as a result of the variables described, in particular in the case of events such as production machine failures, urgent jobs and/or production machine capacities that are being released.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">Optimum production scheduling is referred to as solving a job shop scheduling problem (JSSP).

Neural networks are known to a person skilled in the art for example from:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000">[13] Gunter Daniel Rey, Karl F. Wender, &#x201c;Neuronale Netze&#x201d;, 2nd edition, 2010, Huber.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">The neural network comprises decision nodes connected via edges. In the present case, these are part of a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework, that is to say an algorithm using a decision tree. This involves a promising path being selected in the decision tree (selection), the path being expanded (expansion), a simulation being performed on the basis of the expanded path (simulation) and the simulation result being taken as a basis for providing feedback, in particular in the form of strengthening or weakening, to the decision tree (backpropagation). Details regarding the implementation of an MCTS framework may be obtained from the following publication:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0000">[14] G. Chaslot, S. Bakkes, I. Szita, and P. Spronck, &#x201c;Monte-carlo tree search: A new framework for game ai&#x201d;, in AIIDE, 2008.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">In the present case, the MCTS is performed by the neural network, the neural network receiving preliminary training by way of supervised learning. The decision-making and further training are carried out by means of self-play and reinforcement learning.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">Reinforcement learning (RL) is understood to mean a feedback-based learning process that comprises in particular strengthening and weakening of the decision tree of the MCTS framework. Reinforcement learning is generally representative of a series of methods of machine learning that involve an agent independently learning a strategy in order to maximize obtained rewards. The agent is not shown beforehand which action is best in which situation, but rather receives a reward, which may also be negative, at specific times. It uses these rewards to approximate a benefit function describing what value a specific state or action has.
