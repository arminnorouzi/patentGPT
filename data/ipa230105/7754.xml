The resulting control signal is sent on a power line. The control signal is received by light fixtures and/or sensors through an ultra-narrow band filter, decoded and converted to executable instructions for the light fixtures and data parameters for sensors.

As used herein, lighting fixtures may include both lights and ballasts. Typical lighting control devices offer centralized operation of one or more sets of lighting fixtures. That is, the lighting control device may provide two or more separate sets of controls, with each set of controls configured to control a set of lights. Each set of controls is connected to a port on the controller. A lighting control device may also control external devices, such as fans, through additional ports on the controller.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each of the sets of lights may also be referred to as a &#x201c;zone.&#x201d; By way of example, certain controllers are capable of controlling two lighting sets or zones with as many as 256 light fixtures in each set or zone, for a total of 512 light fixtures. Typically, to connect more than one light fixture to the controller, the light fixtures are daisy chained together using cables and one or more splitters.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each set of light fixtures may be associated with a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is typically connected directly to the controller of the lighting control device. Providing a single dedicated temperature sensor for each zone has significant limitations. For example, 256 light fixtures may illuminate a relatively large area that is likely to include temperature variations within that area and a single dedicated temperature sensor may be unable to detect these variations. Even if the number of light fixtures were reduced to two light fixtures on opposite sides of a single room, it is possible that, should the room contain a metal door, sunlight shining directly on the metal door might make a dramatic difference in the temperature of one side of the room versus the opposite side of the room without the metal door. Thus, a single temperature sensor per zone, even if the zone has only two light fixtures, may be insufficient to properly control the light fixtures. A single temperature sensor provided for an area of any appreciable size or configuration may thus be unable to provide sufficiently precise control.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In typical lighting control devices, an extensive, burdensome, and costly cable infrastructure is required to control lights using a controller, to receive information from a temperature sensor at the controller, and to send commands from the controller to the lights based on the temperature sensor data. Moreover, the temperature sensor typically uses a dedicated cable and connects to a dedicated port on the controller. Thus, whatever length the temperature sensor cable may be, it only serves to carry the temperature sensor data to the controller.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The more extensive portion of the cable infrastructure connects the controller to the lights using RJ12 cable. RJ12 cable is a typical jack-to-unit telephone cable, which runs from a controller to a ballast on the light. Typical lights have the ballast physically connected to the hood and lamp because the cable running from the ballast to the light can generate radio frequency interference. If more than one light is to be connected to the RJ12 port on a controller, a splitter, or Y-adapter, is typically used to both send the control signal to the ballast and to continue carrying the signal to additional light fixtures. Such splitters may fail, leaving the entire system non-functional. Moreover, the introduction of a number of such splitters and additional cables means the addition of cost and failure points for the system.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a lighting control system that can control a lighting system at a lower cost.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Using Power Line Communication to Control Lighting</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Disclosed herein are systems and methods to control lighting fixtures using power line communication (PLC) for both centralized and decentralized control. Centralized control may also be referred to as open loop operation, and decentralized control may also be referred to as closed loop operation. In either type of operation, control signals are sent via PLC. PLC reduces or eliminates the need for dedicated cable infrastructure to send control signals to lighting fixtures. In some embodiments, both types of operation may be used simultaneously in a hybrid open loop/closed loop mode.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A lighting control system may include a control device, a plurality of light fixtures, and a plurality of temperature sensors. The lighting control system may additionally include other sensors, including quantum sensors, light sensors, presence sensors, and humidity sensors. The lighting control system may include a network of power lines to connect each of the components. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;light fixture&#x201d; or &#x201c;light fixtures&#x201d; should be understood to include ballast and hood/light combinations. The control device may be a smart phone, a tablet computer, a laptop, or any other computing device capable of wireless communication either by built in circuitry or an adapter. The control device, light fixtures, and sensors may be generically referred to as components of the system.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each of the components may be electrically connected to a transceiver that is also connected to the power line. The transceiver may be considered to be a component of the lighting control system or it may be considered to be a separate device. In the case of the control device, the transceiver may be part of the control device or may be part of a separate device that performs other functions. For example, the device which performs other functions may be a universal device which may have wired, specifically PLC, and wireless communication capability, and may further perform device management functions. The control device may connect to the universal device via a wired or wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each of the transceivers may have a coupling circuit. The coupling circuit may include several sub-circuits which perform different functions. For example, the coupling circuit may transform the voltage down from the power line voltage, may further regulate voltage, and may perform some filtering of the signal. The filtering may be designed to work in conjunction with the filtering performed by the ultra-narrow band filter in the receiver portion of the transceiver.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The system may operate in two phases. The first phase may include initial power up through when long term system parameters are sent to decentralized control points. During phase two, the light fixtures on the system may be more precisely and autonomously controlled by local commands sent by sensors and potentially by the light fixtures themselves. The system may also continue to receive commands from the control device, creating a hybrid open loop/closed loop operation. Each of the control device, light fixtures and sensors may have a transceiver for communicating via PLC. To enable PLC, the system may further include at least one power line, and one or more outlets.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The disclosed system may use a building's pre-existing electrical wiring to send control signals. The use of PLC eliminates the requirement for creating a cable infrastructure to carry the sensor data and control signals. The control signals are carried on the same wiring as the electrical power signal. Unlike previous lighting systems using PLC, the PLC herein disclosed is much more robust against electrical noise that is almost guaranteed to be present on the power line, and therefore more reliable than other systems that use PLC.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Upon start up, power is applied to the transceiver which transmits control signals based on commands from the control device. The control signal is formed from a sinusoidal wave generated by a crystal oscillator in the transceiver. The crystal oscillator generates a constant sinusoidal wave in the high kHz to MHz range and with a high Q factor. The sinusoidal wave may be split to create a first signal and a second signal, which are both copies of the sinusoidal wave. The second signal may be output to a phase shift circuit. In the phase shift circuit, the second signal may be phase shifted, so that the second signal has a different phase from the first signal.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first signal and the second signal may be combined to form the control signal by alternately outputting either the first signal or second signal using the switch. The first signal may represent a first binary state, that is either of a one or a zero, while the second signal represents the other of the binary states. The switching between the first signal and the second signal is done according to the baseband signal created by the protocol-converted commands from the control device. The resulting signal, called a control signal is output to the power line. The control signal is thus a combination of the first signal and the second signal created according to the baseband signal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Once the control signal is output to a power line, the control signal travels the extent of that power line, and any connected power lines. That is, the control signal will continue on the power line to every terminal in a structure, or even beyond a structure, depending on the design of the power system and the PLC system. In this way, the control signal is broadcast on the power line.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the receiving end, a light fixture or temperature sensor, or other component may be plugged in to a socket of the one or more outlets. This electrically connects the light fixture or temperature sensor to the power line and allows the light fixture or temperature sensor to receive both the power signal and any control signal present on the power line. On the light fixture or temperature sensor, an ultra-narrow band filter electrically connected to the power line filters out all of the signal on the power line except a bandwidth of 50 Hz or less centered on the transmission frequency of the crystal oscillator, which is filtered and passed. Alternatively, the ultra-narrow band filter may filter more than 50 Hz. Once the control signal is received, the control signal may be sent to a processor for baseband decoding transceiver. The decoded baseband signal may then be sent to the processor for conversion by the protocol. The protocol may be stored on a memory in the light fixture or temperature sensor. According to the protocol, a determination is made if the control signal was directed to the light fixture or sensor analyzing the decoded baseband, if not, the control signal is ignored. If the control signal is directed to the light fixture or sensor, the protocol, executing on a processor, converts the decoded baseband signal to executable instructions for controlling a light bulb or tube on the light fixture or for providing parameters to the sensor, or both when the temperature sensor is integrated with the light fixture.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In phase two, the light fixtures may be controlled essentially autonomously by sensors, which send commands based on the parameters stored in phase one, as well as continued control by the control device. Each light fixture may have a temperature sensor electronically connected to it. When a temperature sensor is physically mounted on a light fixture, the temperature sensor and the light fixture may share a transceiver. When the temperature sensors are physically separate from the light fixture or light fixtures, for example, when one temperature sensor is assigned to control two or more light fixtures, each temperature sensor includes a transceiver identical to that of the universal device. When the temperature sensor includes a transceiver, the temperature sensor may include parameters stored in a memory on the sensor which may be set by the control device, and trigger instructions for execution by the processor. For example, the instructions may be dimming the light, or at a different temperature, turning the light off. The control signal is generated by the temperature sensor in the same manner as the control device, except the commands are drawn from a predetermined list stored on the temperature sensor, and triggered by conditions detected by the sensor, rather than being triggered manually as in phase one. For example, the sensor may have a command to turn off the light if a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit is detected by the sensor. Thus, rather than the commands being generated manually, the commands are generated autonomously based on predetermined conditions, in this case, the temperature sensor detecting a temperature of at least 95 degrees.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lighting system <b>100</b> may include a control device <b>102</b>.

The crystal oscillator circuit <b>610</b> draws power from the power line <b>140</b>. The power is taken from the power line <b>140</b> and may be transformed down by a transformer <b>406</b> to a lower voltage. The power may also be converted from alternating current to direct current. The voltage may be transformed down, for example, from 110V to 5 V. On a 0.2 A circuit of the power line <b>140</b>, the 5 V of transformed voltage produces one watt of power for the crystal oscillator circuit <b>610</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, each of two crystal oscillators (signal <b>611</b>, and clock <b>660</b>) may output a signal. The first crystal oscillator may have a first predetermined primary frequency and amplitude. The second crystal oscillator may have a second predetermined primary frequency and amplitude, with the second primary frequency being a multiple of the first primary frequency. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, one crystal oscillator <b>611</b> produces a signal which is split to form the two sinusoidal waves for forming the control signal. The second crystal oscillator <b>660</b> provides a clock signal. The clock signal may be used to control the amount of phase shifting. For example, if a crystal oscillator <b>611</b> of 1 MHz is used to produce the signals for transmission, the crystal oscillator <b>660</b> for the clock signal may be a multiple of 4 MHz. For example, the crystal oscillator <b>660</b> producing the clock's signal may be 16 MHz. Based on the ratio, the transceiver <b>400</b> may produce as many as 15 phase shifted signals in a single cycle of the 1 MHz signal, using the 16 MHz clock signal, as is described in further detail herein. One or more of the phase-shifted signals, along with the original signal, may be used to encode information, as is described in further detail herein. As long as the crystal oscillators receive power, the crystal oscillators will continue to output a signal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Crystal oscillators emit a sinusoidal wave at a frequency determined by their physical structure. Importantly, crystal oscillators, and particularly quartz crystal oscillators, have a very high Q factor. Quartz crystal oscillators are capable of primary frequencies from in the high kHz up to the MHz range. However, higher frequency signals, up to the GHz range, may be produced by amplifying a harmonic of the primary frequency. Further, this disclosure also contemplates using amplified harmonics of the oscillator, and even potentially frequency modulated amplified harmonics, to allow transmission frequencies as low as 1 Hz. Also, as indicated by the high Q factor, they have a narrow bandwidth relative to their frequency. A typical Q factor for a quartz oscillator ranges from 104 to 106, compared to 102 for an inductor and capacitor, or LC, oscillator. The maximum Q for a high stability quartz crystal oscillator can be estimated as Q=1.6&#xd7;107/f, where f is the resonant frequency in megahertz.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another important aspect of quartz crystal oscillators is that quartz crystal oscillators exhibit very low phase noise. In many oscillators, any spectral energy at the resonant frequency is amplified by the oscillator, resulting in a collection of tones at different phases. In a crystal oscillator, the crystal mostly vibrates on one axis, therefore only one phase is dominant. Low phase noise makes crystal oscillators particularly useful in applications requiring stable signals and very precise time references. This is advantageous here because the signal from one of the crystal oscillators may be phase shifted by a precise amount. In some embodiments, for desirable operation of the system, the phase shift between the two signals can be consistent, as is discussed herein in greater detail.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A crystal provides both series and parallel resonance in oscillation. The series resonance is a few kilohertz lower than the parallel resonance. Crystals below 30 MHz are generally operated between series and parallel resonance, which means that the crystal appears as an inductive reactance in operation, this inductance forming a parallel resonant circuit with externally connected parallel capacitance. Any small additional capacitance in parallel with the crystal pulls the frequency lower. Moreover, the effective inductive reactance of the crystal can be reduced by adding a capacitor in series with the crystal. This latter technique can provide a useful method of trimming the oscillatory frequency within a narrow range; in this case inserting a capacitor in series with the crystal raises the frequency of oscillation. For a crystal to operate at its specified frequency, the electronic circuit has to match what is specified by the crystal manufacturer. Note that these points imply a subtlety concerning crystal oscillators in this frequency range: the crystal does not usually oscillate at precisely either of its resonant frequencies.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Crystals above 30 MHz (and even up to &#x3e;200 MHz) are generally operated at series resonance where the impedance appears at its minimum and equal to the series resistance. For these crystals the series resistance is specified (&#x3c;100&#x3a9;) instead of the parallel capacitance. To reach higher frequencies, a crystal can be made to vibrate at one of its overtone modes, which occur near multiples of the fundamental resonant frequency. Only odd numbered overtones are used. Such a crystal is referred to as a 3rd, 5th, or even 7th overtone crystal. To accomplish this, the oscillator circuit usually includes additional LC circuits to select the desired overtone.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, the signal from the transmission signal oscillator <b>611</b> is split to create two identical copies of the crystal oscillator signal. These may be called a first signal and a second signal. Both may be input to an integrated circuit <b>616</b>. The second signal may be routed to a phase shift circuit within the integrated circuit <b>616</b>. The phase shifting process is discussed in greater detail in PCT publication WO 2021/107961, published Jun. 3, 2021, entitled &#x201c;System and Method for Power Line Communication,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the first signal and second signal are next routed to a switch <b>614</b>. The switch <b>614</b> may be a combination of logic gates <b>615</b><i>a</i>-<b>615</b><i>d</i>. There may be at least as many logic gates as there are phase states. Alternatively, the switch may be a fast-switching operation, as is well known in the art, or any other switch which is able to provide fast enough switching, including transistors which may act as switches by having a voltage applied to, and then disconnected from, the base of the transistor. The switch <b>614</b> may be a single pole, dual throw, or SPDT switch. The number of poles corresponds to the number of phase states being used to encode data on the control signal. Described herein is an embodiment with two phase states for ease of understanding, but there could be more than two phase states. Input on one terminal <b>664</b> of the switch <b>614</b> is the first, unchanged signal from the crystal oscillator. Input to a second terminal <b>666</b> is the phase shifted second signal. The switch <b>614</b> may alternate between outputting the first signal and the second signal. The speed of the switch <b>614</b> allows for very rapid alternation between the first signal and the second signal. By way of example and not limitation, the switch <b>614</b> may cycle fast enough to switch 10 times from the first signal to the second signal in a single cycle of a 100 kHz signal. Thus, there is an opportunity, depending on the protocol used by the system, to send 10 bits of information in a single 100 kHz cycle, all without interference by noise. In general, as the frequency increases, the fewer phase states are imparted to the signal. Thus, long wavelengths or lower frequencies may include three or more phase states in a single cycle, while higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths may have as few as two phase states. That is, higher frequencies and shorter wave lengths may only have the original signal and one additional phase state signal. The operation of the system, including the creation and modification of the sinusoidal wave produced by crystal oscillator is discussed in greater detail herein. The transmission portion <b>402</b> is electrically connected to the coupling circuit <b>500</b>, which is in turn connected to the power line <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the transceiver <b>400</b> may be connected to the power line <b>140</b> by a coupling circuit <b>500</b>. The coupling circuit <b>500</b> may include a transformer <b>502</b> for transforming the control signal to the proper voltage for transmission. For example, the voltage may be transformed down from, as just two possible examples, from 110V to 5V, or from 110V to 13.5 V. The coupling circuit <b>500</b> may also include a voltage regulator <b>504</b>. The voltage regulator <b>504</b> serves to protect the more sensitive components in the transmitter <b>402</b> and the receiver <b>404</b> portions downstream in the transceiver <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The coupling circuit <b>500</b>, in addition to providing the proper voltages for transmitting and receiving signals, may also perform filtering functions. The process of transforming the voltage down filters much of the low frequency signal present in the power line <b>140</b>. The coupling circuit <b>500</b> may include further filtering which takes place before the receiver portion <b>404</b> of the transceiver <b>400</b>. After voltage regulation, the signal may pass through one or more coupling circuit filtering stages <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>. The filtering stages <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may include a circuit with one or more resisters and one or more capacitors, commonly known as an RC circuit. These RC circuits <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may form an RC network which filters out certain frequencies within a bandwidth. Thus, while the transformer <b>502</b> acts as a high pass filter, the RC network, which is the combination of the RC circuits <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>acts as a band pass filter. The band pass filtering of the RC network <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>augments the filtering of the ultra-narrow band filter in the receiver portion <b>404</b> of the transceiver <b>400</b>. The ultra-narrow band filter is also a band pass filter. Thus, the Q factor of the combined coupling circuit and ultra-narrow band filter in the receiver portion may be an order of magnitude higher than the Q factor would be for the ultra-narrow band filter alone. By raising the Q factor, the system is able to provide better reception of control signals due to band passing a frequency band so narrow it includes the one or more frequencies of the control signal and little to nothing else. The noise present on frequencies not band passed is greatly suppressed.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the RC network <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be changed if further filtering is required. Thus, the ultra-narrow band filter may not need to have such a high Q factor in embodiments where the coupling circuit <b>500</b> has augmented filtering. Alternatively, the RC network <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>can be changed depending on the transmission frequency. For example, in embodiments where a lower frequency and more phase states are chosen for the control signal, the RC network may be different than the RC network of an embodiment with a higher transmission frequency and fewer phase states are used to form the control signal.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>6</b>B</figref>, on an embodiment of a light fixture <b>200</b>, the transceiver <b>204</b> may be electrically connected to a memory <b>210</b> on which a protocol is stored, and a processor <b>208</b> which is electrically connected to the memory <b>210</b>, and on which the protocol is executed.

There are also combination light fixture/sensor <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> which include light fixtures, but also include sensors which may also further control the light fixtures, as is described in further detail herein. The light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>may include a plug (not shown) for connecting the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>to a conventional outlet. The outlet is electrically connected to the power line <b>140</b>. The light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>further include a receiver portion <b>404</b> to receive the control signal from a transmitter portion <b>402</b> of a control device <b>102</b> or sensor when a sensor is not integrated with the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, a processor for executing the protocol, a memory for storing the protocol, and a transceiver <b>204</b> for sending both self-identification information, and acknowledgement messages to another transceiver <b>400</b>, and a transformer which takes power from the power line for powering the sensor, transceiver and the memory and processor which executes the protocol.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>C</figref>, the transceiver <b>204</b> in the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>or combination light fixture/sensor <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, or sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> uses an ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> to receive control signals sent over the power line <b>140</b>. Just as with the crystal oscillator <b>610</b> in the transceiver <b>204</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>400</b>, the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> has a very high Q factor. For example, the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> may also use a crystal. The crystal's stability and its high Q factor allow for an ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> with a crystal to have precise center frequencies and steep band-pass characteristics. Typical crystal attenuation in the band-pass is approximately 2-3 dB. Thus, the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> only captures frequencies in an ultra-narrow band centered on the frequency produced by the crystal oscillator circuit <b>610</b> and allows the rest of the signal on the power line <b>140</b> to pass. Thus, the power signal on the power line <b>140</b> may be routed to other components in the light fixture to provide power, with the power signal being substantially unaffected.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>C</figref>, this configuration of the crystal oscillator <b>610</b> in the transceiver <b>400</b> and preliminary filtering in the coupling circuit <b>500</b>, and ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> in the receiver portion <b>404</b> of the light fixture <b>200</b> plays a large role in eliminating noise. In some PLC systems, noise has been a problem which completely prohibits, at least in some cases, the use of PLC. Solutions to the electrical noise problem have been proposed, but all are either burdensome, or costly, or both. For example, an external filter may be added to the system to filter out the noise, but external filtering equipment is expensive and bulky, and often required to be wired to a structure's electrical panel. Such solutions merely attempt to fix a broken design after a system is installed and identified not to work.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The disclosed system <b>100</b> does not suffer from electrical noise interfering with the control signal as do typical systems. Most power lines' noise is not generated at the frequency of the control signal. In fact, such closed systems may be designed so that the typical electrical noise output on to the power line <b>140</b>, based on the devices included in the system <b>100</b>, is known, and the one or more frequency for transmission of control signals may be chosen so that it lies in a part of the spectrum away from the known noise. In the case where the noise is present on the same frequency as the control signals, the noise would have to be nearly equal to, or equal to, the power of the control signal to compete in the ultra-narrow bandwidth. The ultra-narrow bandwidth is another aspect of the system <b>100</b> which provides robustness against noise. The electrical noise would have to be found within the bandwidth, which, were the bandwidth relatively wide, would be likely. With the bandwidth so narrow, it is relatively unlikely that electrical noise will be found within the ultra-narrow bandwidth. Moreover, with the relatively high transmission power spread across an ultra-narrow bandwidth, creates a relatively high energy density. In this way, the control signal can compete with, if not outright overmatch, most noise.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Another benefit to the disclosed lighting system <b>100</b> controlled by the disclosed PLC is the distance over which the control signals of the disclosed system <b>100</b> can be transmitted, and the immunity from interference caused by intervening structures. Because the energy of the control signal is placed into a much narrower bandwidth, the control signal does not suffer from attenuation in the way that a broader bandwidth signal with the same energy would. As a result, the signal is able to travel over a longer distance than a similarly powered signal with a greater bandwidth. Further, this effect may be enhanced when using a lower frequency signal with a plurality of phase states. Lower frequencies also suffer less attenuation when traveling over a transmission line. Because PLC uses a wired medium for transmission, intervening structures, including walls and floors do not interfere with the PLC signal in the way they might a wireless signal.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Temperature sensor <b>116</b> may be integrated with the light fixtures <b>114</b><i>a </i>or may be separate components on the system <b>100</b>. Other sensors, for example a combined temperature/humidity sensor <b>120</b><i>a</i>, or combined temperature/humidity sensor <b>120</b><i>b </i>and a quantum sensor <b>124</b>, may also be integrated with the light fixture <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> to form a sensor suite. Alternatively, these sensors may also be separate. Thus, a temperature sensor <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be integrated with the light fixture <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> and the other sensors. For example, humidity sensors.

Alternatively, the light fixture and temperature sensor may share a transceiver and have separate memories and processors. Still further alternatively, the light fixture and the temperature sensor may each have a dedicated transceiver, memory, and processor. Thus, when the temperature sensors <b>312</b> are integrated with the light fixtures <b>300</b>, during phase one operation, all commands may be sent directly to the light fixture <b>300</b> and stored in the shared memory <b>310</b> for processing by the protocol on the processor <b>308</b>, in order to activate features <b>306</b> of the light fixture or to take action based on data taken by the temperature sensor <b>312</b>, or both.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The temperature sensors <b>312</b> may be located on the light fixture <b>300</b> to best advantage of the quality of the data the temperature sensors <b>312</b> are taking.

The memory may store parameters sent by the control device <b>102</b> for a corresponding set of commands already saved to a memory of the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>. The temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>unit may include a power supply which includes a plug to connect to a standard outlet socket to send and receive control signals.

The transceiver may include instructions stored in a memory on the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>which may have certain parameters of commands set by the control device <b>102</b>. For example, the control device <b>102</b> may set a particular temperature as a parameter. Based on the temperature, there may be a command to dim the assigned light fixture, or at a different temperature, to turn the assigned light fixture off. The control signal is generated by the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>in the same manner as the control device <b>102</b>, except the commands are drawn from a predetermined list stored on the memory of the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and triggered by conditions detected by the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>.

There may be fewer humidity sensors <b>130</b> in the system than temperature sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>because there is less likely to be humidity variation within an indoor environment. Sources of water within a structure may affect this, depending on their use, and additional humidity sensors <b>130</b> may be placed in that location, recognizing the effect that the source of water may have. The control device <b>102</b> may use data from the temperature sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the humidity sensors <b>130</b> to determine one or more heat indexes to provide a more accurate measure of the heat in any local area of the wider system. Similar to the temperature parameters, the control device <b>102</b> may send commands based on the heat index to dim lights, or control fans or an HVAC system to change the humidity depending on the measurements taken by the temperature <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and humidity <b>130</b> sensors. Similarly, the humidity sensors <b>130</b> may send commands to fans or an HVAC system based on parameters and instructions stored in a memory, similar to the temperature sensors described herein.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Regardless of whether a single type of light fixture and sensor arrangement is used, or a combination of types of light fixtures and sensor arrangements are used, all of the light fixture and sensor arrangements achieve the purpose of decentralization of sensing and control. As described herein, prior art systems all have centralized sensing and control. With as much as one temperature sensor <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>for every light fixture <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, much more precise control can be achieved because temperature variations within an area are controlled for by the decentralized arrangement.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, the temperature sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, potentially in conjunction with a humidity sensor <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>130</b>, may perform a protection function. That is, the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b </i>may prevent plants from being damaged by dimming the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or turning the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>off to reduce the temperature in and around the plants. This may also be accomplished, to an even greater degree of accuracy, using a heat index measurement.

This heat index may be used to make a determination regarding the function of the light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The heat index may be used in place of temperature to protect the plant. Alternatively, the temperature and humidity sensors may be combined into a single sensor suite <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>. The calculation of the heat index may be done by any processor. Thus, the heat index may be determined by the control device <b>102</b>, one or more of the light fixtures <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> themselves, or the temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>or humidity sensor <b>130</b> may receive the data from the other sensor and perform the calculation on board and send out any corresponding control signals. Regardless of whether temperature or heat index is used as a measure, they are largely used for protection of the plants which may be illuminated by the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Data from one or more quantum sensors <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> may be used to optimize the use of the system <b>100</b>.

The quantum sensors <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> take data that may be used more for optimization of the system <b>100</b> or individual components of the system <b>100</b> rather than for pure protection, as with the temperature and/or humidity sensors. Thus, the quantum sensors <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> may be used to try to get the measured data within a targeted range for optimization, rather than simply on a safe side of line as with the temperature sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b> or humidity sensor <b>130</b>, or combined temperature/humidity sensors <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>. Further, the role of the sensor may affect the optimal placement of the sensor.

The copper wire on which the signals are carried in the power line <b>140</b> has very low failure rates, making a failure on the wire between a temperature sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and a light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>highly unlikely. Thus, additionally, even with the added wire between the control device <b>102</b> and any light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, failures are unlikely.

The second phase may be characterized by a hybrid open loop and closed loop control of the light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>by the system's sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and control device <b>102</b>. In the first phase, after the control device <b>102</b> is powered up, woken up from sleep mode, or connected via a wired or wireless connection to the universal device <b>104</b>, the control device <b>102</b> may interrogate the light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> electrically connected to the power line <b>140</b>. This is done by the control device <b>102</b> sending a command to the light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> to respond to the command with identification information. If a control device <b>102</b> is already connected to the system <b>100</b>, the protocol may require that a light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> which is later connected to the system <b>100</b> send self-identification information to the control device <b>102</b>. The identification information may be sent via a universal device <b>104</b> and may include an identifier for the device and parameters which may be set in operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The protocol is designed such that the control device <b>102</b> and assigned sensors do not send the same commands, rather control is split between the two depending on which is best suited for issuing the command. Further, as described herein, it is possible that the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may control itself with time-based commands, when the light fixture includes an internal time keeping device, and the instructions and parameters are stored in memory.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Soon after power on, a user may manipulate the control device <b>102</b>. The control device <b>102</b> may cause a command to be sent to an electrically connected processor. The processor may be further connected to a memory. The memory may store a protocol. The protocol includes the instructions necessary to convert the received command to a baseband signal. The processor executes the protocol. To encode the baseband signal onto a control signal, the processor uses the baseband signal to control a switch.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Because the control device <b>102</b> receives identification information for each light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> individually, or combination of light fixtures, or temperature sensors connected to the control device <b>102</b>, future commands may be specified as being for a particular light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, or combination thereof. Because these commands contain information identifying the light fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, or combination thereof, to which they are directed, the commands will be ignored by other light fixtures or sensors, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, some or all of the light fixtures or sensors, or combination thereof could be specified by a command. Thus, groups of light fixtures, e.g., a group of light fixtures in a specified area of a structure, may be controlled as a group. In some embodiments, the sensors may be controlled as a group apart from the light fixtures, or vice versa. Or, if, for example, all light fixtures and sensors need to be powered down, this can also be accomplished through the above identification of all light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In fact, there may be a particular identifier in the protocol specifying that a command is for all components of the system, including light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>. The availability of such an identifier prevents the protocol from requiring that each light fixture and temperature sensor have an individual identifier separately listed in a command.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">To send commands to one or more light fixtures <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> with integrated sensors, or to separate sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> during phase one, commands from the control device <b>102</b> are converted to control signals by the protocol. The control signal has two parts. The first part is the sinusoidal wave, which the crystal oscillation circuit <b>610</b> generates continuously, and as shown in Step <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The second part is a sinusoidal wave with a shifted phase, which is shown in Step <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. After generation, the sinusoidal wave is fed to the phase shift circuit to create the second signal, and to the connected switch <b>614</b>, as is described herein. The output of the phase shift circuit is input to a different terminal of the switch than the unaltered first signal or sinusoidal wave. The two signals arriving at the switch are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, including the first signal <b>910</b> and the phase shifted second signal <b>912</b>. In addition to being connected to the oscillator and the phase shift circuit the switch <b>614</b> is also connected to a processor which executes the protocol by providing a baseband signal to the switch. Based on the command signals from the control device, which are converted by the processor using the protocol, the processor directs the switch <b>614</b> to switch between the first signal and second signal according to the baseband signal to encode a control signal as is shown in Step <b>820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Information is encoded by the presence of one or the other of the first signal and the second signal. The first signal my represent one binary state, that is, a one or a zero, and the second signal may represent the other binary state. It will be readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that signals of still differing phase states may be created by adding phase shift circuits which shift the phase of the sinusoidal way differing amounts. By way of example and not limitation, there could be five phase shift circuits, which generate signals with five different phase states. Including the original signal, six phase states are represented. Each phase state may be assigned to represent a binary state.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Alternatively, there may be more than two data states. That is, the protocol may define a non-binary system. For example, there may be three phase states, representing a one, zero, and negative one. Such a protocol may offer more fidelity, and the ability to communicate the same commands with fewer bits of data. Such a system may be achieved using a negative phase shift. That is, from the original signal, a second signal may be created which phase shifts in a positive direction from the original signal, and a third signal may be created which phase shifts in a negative direction from the original signal. The original signal may be assigned to represent a zero, the positive phase shifted signal a one, and the negative phase shift signal a negative one. Other protocols may be used which may have more than three data states.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Sequences of data, encoded with binary bits or otherwise, may form a control signal that can be analyzed and baseband decoded by the protocol. As an example, the light fixtures and sensors may identify themselves using a binary code of a set number of digits. The identification may be a shorter or longer sequence than those of the commands. The protocol may define a preliminary indicator which indicates the start of a command or data string, and a second indicator which indicates the command or data string is complete and requests that the lighting fixture or fixtures, or temperature sensors to which the command was directed send an acknowledgement. Similarly, the protocol may use binary sequences to define commands. By way of example and not limitation, the protocol may define that &#x201c;1001&#x201d; may correspond to a command to turn a lighting fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to 100% of the wattage, while &#x201c;1000&#x201d; may correspond to a command to turn the lighting fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>off. The data and commands may be packaged as messages that include the preliminary indicator that a command or data follows, headers which identify to which fans the command is directed, the command, and an indicator that the command is complete and a request for acknowledgement of the command by the lighting fixture or temperature sensor.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">It should be noted that when the control signal is encoded by the switch, the frequency of the sinusoidal wave is unaffected. Rather, within the control signal only the phase changes with time. Thus, the control signal is output to the power line with the frequency unaffected from when the sinusoidal wave was generated by the crystal oscillator.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Once the control information is encoded by creating the control signal, the control signal is output to a filter circuit <b>621</b>, which filters out sideband signals with a series of local oscillators <b>623</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and capacitors <b>625</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The control signal is sent through a transistor <b>668</b> and lamp <b>670</b> before being output to the power line <b>140</b>, as is shown and described in Step <b>830</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The output is broadcast throughout the power line <b>140</b>. An example control signal <b>1000</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The control signal includes changes of phase as the switch alternates between signals. This is shown in the control signal <b>1000</b> by the first signal <b>1010</b> and the phase shifted second signal <b>1012</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Start up control signals sent during phase one operation by the control device <b>102</b> may include power on signals for the light fixtures <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>. Alternatively, the startup control signals may include parameters, for example power on and power off times for the light fixtures if the light fixtures have internal time keeping devices. Both the power on and power off control signals may be augmented by control signals which indicate ramping up the brightness of the light fixtures during power on and ramping down the brightness of the light fixtures during power off. Ramping up and ramping down may use the dimming function of the lights to gradually power them on from a lower brightness to a greater brightness, and gradually power the lights down from a greater brightness to a lower brightness, and then off. This function is of great benefit when the lighting system is used for indoor agriculture, because the ramping simulates sunrise and sunsets, allowing the lighted crops to function as if they were in an outdoor environment. All of the above control signals may come from the control device during both phase one and phase two of the operation of the system.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Commands or parameters may also be sent during phase one to the sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, without regard to whether the sensors are integrated with the lighting fixtures or are separate components on the system. For example, the controller may send temperature parameters for the temperature sensor's native dimming and shut down commands. The dimming command specifies dimming to a lower wattage when a temperature parameter or heat index is met. By way of example and not limitation, the controller may specify that the temperature sensor should send a command to dim the light to 50% of the current wattage if a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit is detected. The shutdown command turns off the light fixture to which the temperature sensor is assigned if the temperature sensor detects a temperature indicated in the parameter. By way of example and not limitation, if the temperature sensor detects a temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the lighting fixture is commanded to shut down. If the temperature sensor is implemented as a separate component, the controller may send control signals to the temperature sensor that assigns light fixtures to the temperature sensor, which indicates to which light fixtures the temperature sensor is to send control signals. Each temperature sensor may be assigned one or more light fixtures to which the temperature sensor is to send commands. Because the controller is sent identification information by all the system components, a user may identify the components and make the assignment using the control device. The sequence is the same for heat index, with the added step of calculating the heat index from the temperature and humidity data.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">On the receiving end, the control signal <b>1000</b> is received first on the coupling circuit and may be filtered within the coupling circuit as described herein. Next, the control signal is passed from the coupling circuit to the receiving circuit, and, specifically, the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> of the receiver. The receiver may be a part of the transceiver in a light fixture or a sensor. Sensors may be integrated with the light fixtures or added as separate components on the system, as is shown in Step <b>840</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The ultra-narrow band filter filters out only a bandwidth of about 50 Hz or less that is centered on the transmission frequency of the crystal oscillator from the signal on the power line. Naturally, the rest of the signal on the power line is unaffected by the ultra-narrow band filter so that the power on the power line may be used to power lighting fixtures, sensors, or integrated light fixtures and sensors. The 50 Hz or less bandwidth captures the control signal because the phase shifts do nothing to spread the bandwidth of the original sinusoidal wave generated by the crystal oscillator. That is to say, as discussed herein, the signal is not frequency modulated.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Following the filtering, the control signal is amplified in the amplification sub circuit <b>708</b> and baseband decoded in the baseband decoder circuit <b>710</b>. A protocol stored on a memory, and executing on a processor on the light fixture, sensor, or integrated light fixture and sensor, detects and analyzes the information in the control signal <b>1000</b>. The control information encoded on the control signal <b>100</b> may be decoded and converted by the protocol, as shown in Step <b>850</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The conversion may result in instructions which are executable to give commands to the light fixtures and to set parameters for the temperature sensors, either integrated with the light fixtures or as separate components, as shown in Step <b>860</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and described herein.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The use of ultra-narrow bandwidth and phase shifting provides further robust protection against interference by electrical noise on the power line <b>140</b>. For electrical noise on the system to interfere with the control signal, the electrical noise would need to both reach into the narrow bandwidth on which the oscillator is transmitting, and the filter is receiving, and to shift its phase as the control signal <b>1000</b> does. This kind of rapid phase shifting is uncommon in electrical noise, including the noise typically found on power lines. Thus, in addition to all the other ways the system <b>100</b> eliminates electrical noise which may affect the control signal <b>1000</b>, even the manner in which the information is encoded provides robustness against interference by electrical noise.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">After the phase one control signals are sent and received, the system may enter phase two operation. Phase two is characterized by a combination of open and closed loop operation. As described herein, the sensors may send command signals using the same encoding as the control signals from the control device described for phase one operation. However, although manual user control is possible during phase two operation of the system, at least some control is assumed by the sensors during phase two operation. This is shown in Step <b>870</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Based on the temperature parameters provided during phase one, the one or more temperature sensors will automatically send control signals to the assigned lighting fixtures if any of the stored temperature parameter is reached. This is shown in Step <b>870</b> and <b>880</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Per the example given herein for the temperature parameters, if the temperature sensor detects a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature sensor will send a control signal containing a dimming command to the temperature sensor's assigned light fixtures. Alternatively, if the temperature sensor detects a temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature sensor will send a control signal containing a shutdown command to the temperature sensor's assigned light fixtures. All commands which have a temperature as a parameter may be native to the temperature sensor, with the controller providing the parameter of the precise temperature at which the commands should be sent during phase one. Commands from the temperature sensor may be augmented by commands from the control device, but such commands on not required after phase one. Alternatively, a heat index may be used as described herein. Dimming or brightening of the lights may be controlled by the quantum sensors.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Contemporaneously during phase two, the control device <b>102</b> may send commands which include a time as a parameter. The control device <b>102</b> includes a clock function, which may be set to local time. The control device also includes a timing function to control when the lights are powered on and when they are powered off, to simulate daylight during a 24-hour day cycle. The timing function includes sending a control signal to the one or more light fixtures to power on at a predetermined time, and to power off at a predetermined time. The powering on may be customized by ramping the brightness of the one or more light fixtures up to simulate a sun rise, as described herein. Similarly, the powering off may be customized by ramping the brightness of the one or more light fixtures down to simulate a sun set, which is also described herein. Both the ramping time, and the starting brightness, as well as the amount of increase in wattage, and therefore resulting brightness, may be parameters which may be set by a user. These parameters may be built into the control device and may operate essentially autonomously during phase two.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the light fixtures <b>200</b> may include a time keeping device <b>212</b>, for example, a crystal oscillator, and the time-based commands may be stored in a memory <b>210</b> on the light fixture <b>200</b> and executed by the processor <b>208</b> on the light fixture. Such an arrangement would add further robustness to the system as time-based commands, which are typically executed from the control device in typical systems, are off-loaded to individual light fixtures. Thus, even if the control device should fail, or if individual light fixtures should fail, the rest of the system is configured to continue to function normally as to the time-based commands.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The parameters for either the control device or the temperature sensor may be changed at any time by a user. This may be beneficial for any number of reasons but is not required. This may be particularly beneficial in the case of a component failure. Failure detection during phase two is discussed in detail herein.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The lighting fixture <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> may, contemporaneously to any control signals from the control device <b>102</b>, send an acknowledgement of the control signal back to the control device <b>102</b>, or to the sensor <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> if the system is in phase two operation. The receiver portion of the universal device or sensor receives the acknowledgement, the processor converts it using the protocol, and, accordingly, the controller <b>102</b> does not resend the command. In the event that the control device does not receive the acknowledgement, the protocol operating on the control device <b>102</b> directs the transceiver <b>400</b> connected most directly to the control device to send the command again after a pre-determined time interval. This pattern continues until the acknowledgement is received from the lighting fixture or sensor given the control signal.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Should the control device <b>102</b> fail, the control device <b>102</b> will no longer send commands. Although this is considered a system failure, as the control device <b>102</b> may send commands to every other device on the system, it is not catastrophic because it is both easy to detect if the time-based commands are sent by the control device alone. When the time-based commands are shared between the control device and the one or more light fixtures or controlled entirely after phase one by the light fixtures alone, the one or more light fixtures will continue to function under the control signals available to the one or more sensors on the system, and under the light fixtures own control for time-based commands. Thus, given that much of the operation of the system may be automated after phase one, a failure the control device in phase two may have very little impact.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The light fixtures failing to turn off is more dangerous because if the light fixtures are left on for long periods of time, heat may build and damage plants. Through decentralized control, the system has internal robustness against this risk. First, as mentioned, the time-based commands may be executed on individual fixtures. The one or more temperature sensors will continue to function. The one or more temperature sensors send the control signals to dim the light fixtures at a first predetermined temperature, and to shut off at a second, higher predetermined temperature. Thus, if the temperature is high enough to be detrimental to what the light fixtures are illuminating, even if the control device <b>102</b> has failed, and even though the time-based commands have not been shifted to the individual light fixtures for execution, the one or more temperature sensors will dim the lights as the first predetermined temperature is reached, and then will shut the lights off as the second predetermined temperature is reached. In this way, the decentralized control prevents damage to the plants. If the light fixtures don't come back on, the control device <b>102</b> failure is, again, easily detected and rectified by replacing the control device <b>102</b> and starting back up.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example Receiver</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The receiver includes a plurality of sub-circuits. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, a received control signal may first pass through a high frequency amplification sub-circuit <b>702</b> of the receiver. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, a mixing and amplification sub-circuit <b>704</b> may be connected to the high frequency amplification sub-circuit <b>702</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, connected to the mixing and amplification sub-circuit <b>704</b> is an ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b>. The ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> passes a very narrow band of frequencies, for example, 10 Hz. Just as with the crystal oscillator in the transceiver <b>104</b> and transceivers <b>126</b><i>a</i>-<i>i</i>, the crystal in the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> has a very high Q factor. The crystal's stability and its high Q factor allow ultra-narrow band filters <b>706</b> to have precise center frequencies and steep band-pass characteristics. Thus, the ultra-narrow band filter only captures frequencies in an ultra-narrow band centered on the frequency produced by the crystal oscillator circuit <b>110</b> and does not allow the rest of the signal on the power line to pass to the transceiver. Thus, the power signal on the power line may be routed to other components in the device to provide power, with the power signal being substantially unaffected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, the ultra-narrow band filter <b>706</b> is connected to an amplitude limiting sub-circuit <b>708</b>. A control signal passing through the amplitude limiting sub-circuit has the amplitude controlled because too high amplitude in the control signal can cause distortion in the control signal when the control signal is decoded. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>, the amplitude limiting sub-circuit <b>708</b> may be connected to a baseband decoding sub-circuit <b>710</b>.

The baseband decoding sub-circuit <b>710</b> uses one or more integrated circuits <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> to convert the control signal into a binary baseband signal.
