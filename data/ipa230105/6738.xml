Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to communication between free space optical (FSO) communication nodes in motion relative to each other and, more particularly, to optimizing transmit and receive angles for the nodes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">FSO communication is an optical communication technology that uses light propagating in free space to wirelessly transmit data, for example, for telecommunications or computer networking. Free space is a communication medium that can include air, outer space, or vacuum and contrasts with solid communication mediums, such as optical fiber cables. FSO technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations. FSO technology typically requires very accurate pointing between nodes to establish and maintain a viable FSO link.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A free space optical (FSO) communication node (also referred to as a terminal) in motion relative to a remote FSO node may set a transmit (Tx) direction of a Tx beam towards an expected future location of a remote FSO node. This point ahead angle may cause a large misalignment between the local FSO node and a receive (Rx) beam from the remote FSO node. This may contribute substantially to Rx coupling losses since only a portion of the Rx beam is collected by the local FSO node.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments described herein overcome this problem. Instead of directing the Tx beam along a point ahead angle (which may result in undesirable Rx coupling losses between the Rx beam and the FSO node), the FSO node directs the Tx beam in a direction based on the point ahead angle and a point ahead offset angle (also referred to as a point ahead correction). The point ahead offset angle modifies the point ahead angle to reduce Rx coupling losses while keeping Tx pointing losses at least low enough to maintain the FSO communication link. In some cases, this modified point ahead angle minimizes a sum of the Rx coupling losses and the Tx pointing losses. Thus, by directing the Tx beam based on the point ahead angle and point ahead offset angle, the Rx and Tx coupling efficiencies between the nodes may be increased without adding additional components to the FSO nodes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments relate to an FSO communication terminal includes a Tx pathway, a Rx pathway, a beam steering unit, and a control system. The FSO communication terminal may be collinear or co-borsighted. The Tx pathway is configured to transmit a data-encoded Tx optical beam through free space to a remote FSO communication terminal. The Tx pathway is oriented along a direction in free space, and a relative motion between the two FSO communication terminals is known. The Rx pathway is configured to receive a data-encoded Rx optical beam transmitted through free space from the remote FSO communication terminal. The Rx pathway is oriented along the same direction in free space as the Tx pathway. The Rx pathway may remain oriented along the same direction as the Tx pathway during operation of the FSO communication terminal. The beam steering unit is configured to adjust the direction of the Rx and Tx pathways. The controller system is configured to apply a point ahead offset to the direction of the Rx and Tx pathways based on both (a) an estimated reception of the Tx optical beam at the remote FSO terminal (given the known relative motion) and (b) an estimated reception of the Rx optical beam at the FSO terminal (given the known relative motion).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The estimated reception of the Tx optical beam at the remote FSO terminal may be based on a Tx pointing loss function and the estimated reception of the Rx optical beam at the FSO terminal may be based on a Rx coupling loss function. In some embodiments, the point ahead offset minimizes a sum of the Tx pointing loss function and the Rx coupling loss function. Additionally or alternatively, the point ahead offset is selected such that Tx pointing loss is below a threshold value and the point ahead offset is selected such that Rx coupling loss is below the same threshold value or a different threshold value.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The point ahead offset may be smaller than the point ahead and it may change over time. The direction of the Rx and Tx pathways may be equal to the point ahead minus the point ahead offset. In some embodiments, the point ahead is less than <b>20</b> microradians and the point ahead offset is greater than zero and less than or equal to <b>9</b> microradians.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Rx pathway may include a wavefront sensor that receives a portion of the Rx optical beam. In this case, the control system may modify the point ahead offset based on a location or position of the portion of the Rx optical beam on the wavefront sensor. In some embodiments, the Rx pathway includes a single mode fiber oriented to receive at least a portion of the Rx optical beam. Additionally or alternatively, the Rx pathway may include an optical amplifier configured to amplify at least a portion of the Rx optical beam.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects include components, devices, systems, improvements, methods, processes, applications, computer readable mediums, and other technologies related to any of the above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the disclosure have other advantages and features which will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims, when taken in conjunction with the examples in the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">FIGS. lA is a block diagram of a free space optical (FSO) node, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a block diagram of a beam steering unit of the FSO node, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> are diagrams of an optical tracking device (the Tx/Rx Subassembly), according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> are diagrams of an FSO link between two satellites, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref> are graphs of loss functions, according to some embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The figures and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only.

The FSO node <b>100</b> communicates with a remote FSO node of similar design by transmitting and receiving FSO optical signals <b>120</b> (also referred to as beams). The FSO node <b>100</b> includes a fore optic <b>102</b> (also referred to as a telescope), Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>, control system <b>110</b>, optical circulator <b>114</b>, Tx source <b>116</b>, amplifier <b>122</b>, and Rx electronics <b>118</b>. The fore optic <b>102</b> is optically coupled to the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>. The Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> is optically coupled to the Rx electronics <b>118</b> and to the Tx source <b>116</b> by the optical circulator <b>114</b>. The Rx electronics <b>118</b>, Tx source <b>116</b>, Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>, and fore optic <b>102</b> are electrically coupled to the control system <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the FSO node <b>100</b> may contain additional, fewer, or different components.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a node design with collinear Tx and Rx optical components. This eliminates the &#x201c;boresight problem&#x201d; of having to maintain alignment between Tx and Rx optical systems. For example, the alignment between the Tx and Rx optical systems remains constant during operation of the node (e.g., the collinear system doesn't include a component configured to change the alignment). In the collinear approach, the same primary optical system carries signals both for Tx and Rx paths, reducing weight and complexity of separate optical components for Tx and Rx beams. Collinear optical design also simplifies the system and enhances reliability by eliminating separate pointing and tracking mechanisms for Tx and Rx. Reliance on fiber-based components (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) further reduces system weight and simplifies assembly. These properties are especially important for systems to be used aboard spacecraft or other applications that require robustness, light weight, and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The light <b>120</b> includes received and transmitted optical signals for FSO node <b>100</b>. The received and transmitted optical signals can include data-encoded communication information. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, optical signals <b>120</b> travel bi-directionally into (i.e., the receive direction) and out of (i.e., the transmit direction) the FSO node <b>100</b> through the fore optic <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The fore optic <b>102</b> is an optical component that collects and directs received light signals <b>120</b> to the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> and directs transmit light signals <b>120</b> from the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> to the remote FSO node <b>100</b>. For instance, the fore optic <b>102</b> may include a lens and/or a beam expander. The position of the fore optic <b>102</b> may be physically controlled by the control system <b>110</b>. For example, based on position information from the Tx/Rx subassembly, the control system <b>110</b> may adjust the position of the fore optic <b>102</b> (or a component of the fore optic) such that the received light <b>120</b> is centered upon the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>. The fore optic <b>102</b> may be configured to spread, focus, redirect, and otherwise modify the light <b>120</b> passing through the fore optic <b>102</b>. The fore optic <b>102</b> may also include optical components configured to reduce external effects not relevant to beam alignment of the received light <b>120</b>. For example, the fore optic <b>102</b> may include a component that reduces atmospheric scintillation effects. The fore optic <b>102</b> may be as simple as a single lens or it may include additional optical components, such as diffusers, phase screens, beam expanders, and lenses.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the fore optic <b>102</b> includes a beam steering unit (BSU). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example fore optic <b>102</b> with a BSU <b>124</b>. For simplicity, the BSU <b>124</b> is the only illustrated component of the fore optic <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. However, as previously described, the fore optic <b>102</b> may include additional or other components.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The BSU <b>124</b> is an optical component that receives instructions from the control system <b>110</b> to direct Rx beams <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> and directs Tx beams <b>120</b><i>b </i>to a remote FSO node. The BSU <b>124</b> may take many different forms. The BSU <b>124</b> can be a mechanically driven reflective or refractive device. Examples of such devices include mirrors, Fresnel devices, lenslet arrays and more. A mechanical driver for any one of these examples can include voice-coil actuators, piezoelectric actuators, servo-motor driven positioners, and many other approaches. Microelectronic arrays (MEMS) devices can also be used to steer a beam. Opto-acoustic devices that exploit acoustic waves in reflective or refractive materials can also be used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The Tx direction may be determined or updated based on feedback signals (e.g., alignment errors) from the control system <b>110</b>. In some cases, the BSU <b>124</b> is oriented to direct the Tx beam <b>120</b><i>b </i>along the same direction as the Rx beam <b>120</b><i>a </i>is received (e.g., if the FSO nodes are stationary relative to each other). In other cases, the BSU <b>124</b> is oriented to direct the Tx beam <b>120</b><i>b </i>along a different direction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, in these cases, the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> may receive the Rx beam at a different angle or location than the Tx beam. In an example case, atmospheric conditions between nodes <b>100</b> can affect beams differently depending on their propagation direction. In this case, Tx and Rx beams may travel different optical paths between nodes <b>100</b>. In another example case, if a remote node is moving, the BSU <b>124</b> may direct a Tx beam with an angular bias to account for travel time of the Tx beam.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> receives light signals <b>120</b> directed by the fore optic <b>102</b> and transmits light signals <b>120</b> from the Tx source <b>116</b>. The Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> is used for positioning, acquisition, and tracking (PAT). Specifically, light <b>120</b> received by the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> is used to determine alignment information of the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> in relation to the fore optic <b>102</b> and the FSO node <b>100</b> in relation to a remote FSO node. For example, the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> includes detection sensors that detect the light signals <b>120</b> from the fore optic <b>102</b> and determine alignment information from the received light <b>120</b>. The Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> can provide alignment information to the control system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The optical circulator <b>114</b> allows light signals <b>120</b> to pass between the Rx electronics <b>118</b>, Tx source <b>116</b>, and Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>. Through the circulator <b>114</b>, received light signals <b>120</b> from the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> are directed to the Rx electronics <b>118</b> and transmit light signals <b>120</b> from the Tx source <b>116</b> are directed to the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>. The circulator <b>114</b> can be a single-mode or multi-mode circulator.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The Tx/Rx fiber <b>112</b> is an optical fiber, such as a single-mode fiber (SMF) or a multi-mode fiber (MMF), that carries both Rx and Tx beams. The use of a single-mode fiber may allow higher bandwidths compared to a multi-mode fiber. For example, for bandwidths of <b>10</b> Gbps (gigabytes per second) and higher, the Rx electronics <b>118</b> require a single mode fiber. In another example, long range FSO link systems may also require SMF receivers to get higher receiver sensitivity. In FSO Rx subsystems that use a single-mode fiber to collect the Rx optical beam, the core of the optical fiber is small (e.g., a diameter or <b>9</b> mm) and Rx signal that misses it is lost. Therefore, even a small pointing misalignment causes significant coupling loss. This may motivate the use of a multi-mode fiber or a plurality of single-mode fibers in a receiver system. These collect the optical beam over a wider range of incoming angles, and thereby confer additional robustness in pointing and tracking. However, some Rx signal is nevertheless lost whenever pointing ahead is implemented. Furthermore, the use of a multi-mode fiber or multiple single-mode fibers may add undesirable system complexity and cost. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a single Tx/Rx fiber <b>112</b>, the node <b>100</b> may include multiple fibers, for example, a Tx fiber and a Rx fiber that are parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The Rx electronics <b>118</b> determine data encoded in the received light <b>120</b> signals. The Rx electronics <b>118</b> can include optical components, such as optical filters, to prepare the received light <b>120</b> to be converted to electrical signals.

If no portion of the Rx beam <b>206</b> is received by the Tx/Rx fiber <b>112</b> (e.g., Rx beam <b>206</b> isn't incident on the fiber or the angle of incidence is large), then the FSO node <b>100</b> is not capturing the data intended for receipt. In this case, the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b> or fore optic <b>102</b> may be repositioned.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wavefront sensor <b>202</b> lies in plane <b>212</b> and is used for signal acquisition and alignment of the FSO node <b>100</b> system.

Each satellite includes an FSO node and communicate with each other over an FSO link (e.g., an optical intersatellite link (OISL)). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate the FSO link from the point of view of the FSO node in satellite <b>301</b>. A similar situation exists for satellite <b>302</b>. The first satellite <b>301</b> communicates with the second satellite <b>302</b>, and the second satellite <b>302</b> moves on a projected path <b>307</b> (also referred to as known travel path) from location <b>308</b>R to location <b>308</b>T. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate the position of satellite <b>301</b> at time t<b>1</b> and the positions of satellite <b>302</b> at times t<b>1</b>&#x2212;&#x394;, t<b>1</b>, and t<b>1</b>+&#x394;, where A is the travel time for an FSO beam to travel from one satellite to the other. Since the projected path <b>307</b> may be known, satellite <b>301</b> knows that satellite <b>302</b> will be at location <b>308</b>T when it receives a new beam transmitted from satellite <b>301</b> at time tl. Note that the FSO beams are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>E</figref> as lines for convenience. Practically, the beams have widths and spread out over time. For example, the beams have gaussian profiles.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Both satellites being in motion, the Rx beam <b>303</b> received by satellite <b>301</b> at time tl appears to come from location <b>308</b>R from second satellite <b>302</b>. Location <b>308</b>R may be satellite <b>302</b>'s actual location at the time of transmitting Rx beam <b>303</b>. However, location <b>308</b>R may not be satellite <b>302</b>'s actual location at time of transmitting Rx beam <b>303</b> (discussed further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The point ahead angle in this system is angle <b>310</b>. As previously described, a point ahead angle is an angular bias relative to a Rx direction that accounts for travel time of a Tx beam (for situations where the relative velocity and distance between a local and a remote FSO node is large). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the point ahead angle <b>310</b> is equal to the sum of Rx beam misalignment angle <b>305</b> and the Tx beam mispointing angle <b>306</b>. The Rx misalignment angle <b>305</b> is the angular deviation of the Tx beam <b>304</b> away from the Rx direction, and the Tx beam mispointing angle <b>306</b> is the angular deviation of the Tx beam <b>304</b> away from the point ahead angle <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">To maintain the FSO link, satellite <b>301</b> aims to transmit Tx beam <b>304</b> so that it is received by satellite <b>302</b> and also aims to receive Rx beam <b>303</b> from satellite <b>302</b>. However, satellite <b>301</b> may include collinear Tx and Rx optical components (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). In this case, if satellite <b>301</b> points towards location <b>308</b>T (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), Tx beam <b>302</b> will be received by satellite <b>302</b> with little or no coupling losses (&#x201c;Tx pointing losses&#x201d;) (this assumes that satellite <b>302</b> will point at satellite <b>302</b> to receive Tx beam <b>302</b>). However, the Rx optical path of satellite <b>301</b> will be misaligned with the propagation direction of Rx beam <b>303</b> because satellite <b>301</b> is not pointing at location <b>308</b>R, resulting in increased Rx coupling losses. In some cases, this situation results in satellite <b>301</b> receiving none of the Rx beam <b>303</b> or receiving an amount of Rx beam <b>303</b> that is insufficient to maintain the FSO link.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, if satellite <b>301</b> points towards location <b>308</b>R (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), Rx beam <b>303</b> will be received by satellite <b>301</b> with little or no Rx coupling losses (this assumes that satellite <b>302</b> pointed at satellite <b>301</b> to transmit Rx beam <b>303</b>). However, the Tx optical path of satellite <b>301</b> will not be aligned with location <b>308</b>T, resulting in increased Tx pointing losses. In some cases, this situation results in satellite <b>302</b> receiving none of the Tx beam <b>304</b> or receiving an amount of Tx beam <b>304</b> that is insufficient to maintain the FSO link.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since satellite <b>301</b> cannot point in two directions at once, the actual Tx beam <b>304</b> direction is determined by balancing the tradeoff between these two situations. By pointing satellite <b>301</b> somewhere between locations <b>308</b>R and <b>308</b>T, satellite <b>301</b> may receive enough of Rx beam <b>303</b> and satellite <b>302</b> may receive enough of Tx beam <b>304</b> to maintain the FSO link. The specific Tx direction is determined by modifying the point ahead angle by a point ahead offset angle. This modified point ahead angle reduces Rx coupling losses (compared to the point ahead angle) while keeping Tx pointing losses low enough to maintain the optical link. For example, the modified point ahead angle (e.g., angle <b>305</b>) of Tx beam <b>304</b> is the point ahead angle <b>310</b> minus the point ahead offset angle (e.g., angle <b>306</b>). In this case, as the point ahead offset angle is increased, the Rx coupling losses decrease and the Tx pointing losses increase.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, satellite <b>302</b> may also be pointing at modified point ahead angles. In this case, the actual Rx beam <b>308</b> may not propagate directly toward satellite <b>301</b> (which was the ideal point ahead direction for satellite <b>302</b> at time t<b>1</b>&#x2212;&#x394;), but instead may propagate at a modified angle (indicated by the direction of beam <b>308</b>). Furthermore, instead of satellite <b>302</b> pointing along the ideal point ahead direction for satellite <b>301</b>, satellite <b>302</b> may point at another modified angle (indicated by the dotted line at location <b>308</b>T). These modified angles by satellite <b>302</b> may cause additional Rx coupling losses and Tx pointing losses for satellite <b>301</b>. In some embodiments, satellite <b>301</b> accounts for the modified angles of satellite <b>302</b> when determining the modified point ahead angle. In other embodiments, satellite <b>301</b> may only consider the ideal point ahead directions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring back to the point ahead offset, the point ahead offset angle may be chosen so that a sum of the Rx coupling losses and the Tx pointing losses is reduced (e.g., minimized). In another example, the point ahead offset angle is chosen so that the Rx coupling losses and the Tx pointing losses are below a threshold, where the threshold ensures that enough of each beam is received to maintain the FSO link. Additionally or alternatively, the point ahead offset angle may depend on the FSO link distance (e.g., derived through timing data exchange), the point ahead angle, the Tx and Rx beam divergences, the configuration of the Tx/Rx subassembly <b>104</b>, the fiber type of the Tx/Rx fiber <b>112</b>, aperture size of the telescope <b>102</b>, or the jitter magnitude.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the point ahead offset angle ranges from <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> microradians (urad). The modified point ahead angle may be implemented when the point ahead angle is <b>20</b> urad or less. If the point ahead angle is larger than <b>20</b> urad, there may not be a point ahead offset angle that results in sufficient Rx coupling and Tx pointing.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The point ahead offset may be a function of the point ahead angle. Thus, the point ahead offset angle may change over time as the point ahead angle changes (e.g., due to changes in relative speed or distance between satellites <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>). For example, if satellites <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are in different orbits or in orbits with significant ellipticity, they may have point ahead angles that change over time due their changing relative heading, speed, and distance. In another example, two satellites in the same elliptical orbit may experience different accelerations in different parts of the orbit and therefore may have variable point-ahead, even though they nominally follow identical paths around the Earth. For example, satellites in identical orbits with eccentricity 0.7 but separated by &#xbc; period sometimes see each other approaching or receding to either side of orbital perigee. However, in some situations, the point ahead angle may be constant. For example, if satellites <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are in orbits with fixed relative speed and position (e.g., identical but phase-offset circular orbits around the Earth), such orbits may result in a constant point ahead angle.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The modified point ahead, point ahead, or point ahead offset may be pre-calculated and stored in a lookup table that is accessed during operation of the FSO node. For example, modified point ahead angles may be predetermined for FSO nodes in orbit since their absolute and relative motions may follow well-defined orbital trajectories. For example, if satellites <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are in identical orbits with eccentricity 0.7 but separated by &#xbc; period, the two satellites may have point-ahead angles that switch positive and negative but predictably repeat with each orbit. In another example, satellites <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> have two circular orbits that are inclined relative to each other. Such orbits cross each other and thus may predictably switch pointing angle and point-ahead polarity at the crossings. Other embodiments may compute the modified point ahead angles dynamically during operation (e.g., at the time it is required to orient the Tx beam <b>304</b>). For example, a point-ahead processor (e.g., implemented as part of control system <b>110</b>) may use a priori knowledge of orbital parameters to determine instantaneous velocities and directions between the nodes and thereby derive a modified point ahead angle. Time and frequency synchronization between FSO nodes may also be available to provide an additional estimate of relative range. This can be used to verify or refine the orbital parameters and the modified point ahead direction.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the modified point ahead is based on real time values, such as the received power, signal-to-noise ratio, or bit error rates at one or both FSO nodes. In some embodiments, a modified point ahead is determined based on signal amplitude or signal quality metrics as they are received or derived at an FSO node. Other example real time values include beam amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and polarization balance. After communication is established between a remote and local node, an embodiment may transfer this information over the optical link so that both node controllers maintain history of signal strength at both nodes. This enables the processors at either or both nodes to jointly and cooperatively optimize the modified point ahead offset angles in either or both directions.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one approach, a modified point ahead angle is implemented by adding a wavefront offset to the feedback loop from a wavefront sensor (e.g., sensor <b>202</b>). For example, to maintain the modified point ahead angle, the control system <b>110</b> instructs the beam steering unit <b>124</b> to steer an Rx beam at a location on the wavefront sensor that is offset from the center.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The modified point ahead angle may be implemented even when the optical beams between enter and leaves Earth's atmosphere (e.g., if one node is in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and the other node is on earth's surface). In these situations, point ahead functionality can be extended by incorporating a refraction computation, based on orbital mechanics or on pointing aberrations that can be attributed to the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a graph of an example Tx pointing loss function that describes Tx pointing losses. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates Tx pointing loss vs. pointing error for an FSO node with a <b>90</b>-millimeter aperture, a beam divergence of <b>37</b>.<b>64</b> urad, and it assumes <b>6</b> urad of jitter, according to an embodiment. Pointing error is the deviation away from the point ahead angle (with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the pointing error is the Tx mispointing angle <b>306</b>). Notice that as pointing error increases, the pointing loss exponentially increases. In other words, the larger the point ahead offset angle, the less a remote FSO node will receive of a Tx beam. Practically, beam divergence reduces the fraction of power transmitted from one node that is received by the other, and this pointing loss increases with range. Thus, for communication between nodes at short range, the tolerable pointing loss may be greater than at longer ranges. In some embodiments, a maximum tolerable pointing loss may depend on the FSO link error margin which may be a function of many parameters e.g., including link distance.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a graph of example Rx coupling loss functions that describe Rx coupling losses. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> describes Rx coupling loss vs. Rx angle for example lenses (in the fore optic) with various f-numbers (F#), according to an embodiment. The graph describes an FSO system with a <b>90</b> mm aperture. Rx angle is the deviation away from the Rx direction of a Rx beam (with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the Rx angle deviation is the Rx beam misalignment angle <b>305</b>), and f-number refers to the ratio of focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil of the lens.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Similar to the previous figure, the plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> are exponential. Thus, as Rx angle increases, the coupling losses increase at a faster rate. Additionally, for small Rx angles (e.g., less than <b>10</b> urad), lenses with smaller f-numbers have larger coupling losses, while for larger Rx angles (e.g., larger than <b>10</b> urad), lenses with smaller f-numbers have smaller coupling losses. As described above with respect to tolerable pointing losses, tolerable coupling losses may also depend on the FSO link configuration. For example, for communication between nodes at short range, the tolerable coupling loss may be greater than at longer ranges.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is another graph of example Rx coupling loss functions that describe Rx coupling losses. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a graph of coupling loss vs. airy disk mismatch for lenses (in the fore optic) with various f-numbers, according to an embodiment. The airy mismatch describes the difference between the location of the focus of an Rx beam and a center point of the Rx fiber. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the airy mismatch is the distance between a center point of the fiber <b>112</b> and a center point of Rx beam <b>206</b>. Similar to the previous figures, the plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> are exponential. Thus, as airy disk mismatch increases, the coupling losses increase at a faster rate. Additionally, lenses with smaller f-numbers have larger coupling losses.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a graph of loss vs. modified point ahead angle for various point ahead angles for a fore optic lens with an f-number of 4.1. Loss describes the combined Rx coupling losses and the Tx pointing losses for a given modified point ahead angle. Thus, the point ahead offset angle may be determined by subtracting the modified point ahead angle from the point ahead angle. Since Rx coupling losses and Tx pointing losses are each exponential, the resulting combined loss plots have u-shapes. Thus, for a given plot, the optimal modified point ahead angle is an angle at the bottom of the u-shape that minimizes the losses. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, modified point ahead angles of 5, 6.5, 8.8, and 10.2 urad respectively minimize the loss for point ahead angles of 5.7, 10.5, 15.4, and 19.5 urad. Note that as point ahead angle increases the plots have higher losses and the optimal modified point ahead angle increases.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the detailed description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but merely as illustrating different examples.
