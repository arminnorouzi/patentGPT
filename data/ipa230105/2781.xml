Methods for controlling pests and pathogens often include spraying plants with harsh chemicals. Typical fungicides used include compounds of heavy metals such as copper and arsenic, as well as organosulfur and organochlorine compounds. These compounds are often not satisfactory because of their potential for accumulating in the environment to levels considered to be unsafe, in particular contaminating natural resources such as drinking water and polluting the soil. Further, fungicides and other pesticides have strong physiological effects on the plants, may produce residues that are toxic to food crops, can have high animal toxicity, and are potentially hazardous to workers using them.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need to identify resistant genes and compounds and develop compositions and methods for controlling pests and pathogens.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described in conjunction with systems, tools and methods which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting in scope.

They were filtered to identify candidate SNPs linked to the <i>S. commersonii </i>resistance. The number of remaining SNPs in windows of 100 Kb were plotted over the 12 chromosome of the potato genome.

In order to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; refers to one or more of that entity; for example, &#x201c;a primer&#x201d; refers to one or more primers or at least one primer. As such, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; (or &#x201c;an&#x201d;), &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. In addition, reference to &#x201c;an element&#x201d; by the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the elements is present, unless the context clearly requires that there is one and only one of the elements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Artificially manipulated. as used herein, &#x201c;artificially manipulated&#x201d; means to move, arrange, operate or control by the hands or by mechanical means or recombinant means, such as by genetic engineering techniques, a plant or plant cell, so as to produce a plant or plant cell that has a different biological, biochemical, morphological, or physiological phenotype and/or genotype in comparison to unmanipulated, naturally-occurring counterpart.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Backbone. Nucleic acid sequence of a vector that excludes the DNA insert sequence intended for transfer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Broad-spectrum. A &#x201c;broad spectrum compound&#x201d; is a compound having broad spectrum activity, which is effective against a range of organisms. For example, a broad-spectrum fungicide is effectively active against multiple pathogens (i.e. fungi).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Degenerate primer. A &#x201c;degenerate primer&#x201d; is an oligonucleotide that contains sufficient nucleotide variations that it can accommodate base mismatches when hybridized to sequences of similar, but not exact, homology.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Early blight. Early blight is a fungal disease in plants caused by species of the <i>Alternaria </i>genus. It is a common disease in plants of the <i>Solanum </i>genus, for example, tomatoes and potatoes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Event. Event refers to the unique DNA recombination event that took place in one plant cell, which was then used to generate entire transgenic plants. Plant cells are transformed with a vector carrying a DNA insert of interest. Transformed cells are regenerated into transgenic plants, and each resulting transgenic plant represents a unique event. Different events possess differences in the number of copies of DNA insert in the cell genome, the arrangement of the DNA insert copies and/or the DNA insert location in the genome.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Foreign. &#x201c;Foreign&#x201d; with respect to a nucleic acid is non-native nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Functional homolog. In this disclosure, &#x201c;functional homolog&#x201d; refers to a protein or a gene (DNA sequence) encoding a protein that shares the same or similar functions in a biological, biochemical, catalytic or metabolic process. The &#x201c;functional homolog&#x201d; may be an actual homolog by virtue of descent from a common ancestor, or it may be unrelated (for example, an analogous sequence or protein arisen from convergent evolution).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Fungal-like. As used herein, &#x201c;fungal-like&#x201d; refers to those pathogens which respond to fungicides, including, but not limited to, for example, <i>Plasmopara viticola </i>and <i>P. infestans. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Single locus Converted (Conversion). Single locus converted (conversion) plant refers to plants wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of a variety are recovered in addition to the one or more loci transferred into the variety via, for example, the backcrossing technique, via genetic engineering or via mutation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Genetic rearrangement. Refers to the re-association of genetic elements that can occur spontaneously in vivo as well as in vitro which introduce a new organization of genetic material. For instance, the splicing together of polynucleotides at different chromosomal loci, can occur spontaneously in vivo during both plant development and sexual recombination. Accordingly, recombination of genetic elements by non-natural genetic modification techniques in vitro is akin to recombination events that also can occur through sexual recombination in vivo.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Isolated. &#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; refers to any nucleic acid or compound that is physically separated from its normal, native environment. The isolated material may be maintained in a suitable solution containing, for instance, a solvent, a buffer, an ion, or other component, and may be in purified, or unpurified, form. Isolated may also refer to nucleic acid that has been isolated from an organism and is maintained, for example, in a plasmid.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Late blight. A potato disease caused by the oomycete <i>Phytophthora infestans </i>and also known as &#x2018;potato blight&#x2019; that can infect and destroy the leaves, stems, fruits, and tubers of potato plants.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Marketable Yield. Marketable yield is the weight of all tubers harvested that are between 2 and 4 inches in diameter. Marketable yield is measured in cwt (hundred weight) where cwt=100 pounds.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Native. A &#x201c;native&#x201d; genetic element refers to a nucleic acid that naturally exists in, originates from, or belongs to the genome of a plant that is to be transformed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Non-natural nucleotide junction. &#x201c;Non-natural nucleotide junction&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-naturally occurring nucleotide junction&#x201d; refers to a sequence of nucleotides that do not occur in nature. Rather, these sequences are formed via a genetic transformation event. For example, the genetic transformation events described herein may be created with expression cassettes that contain no non-native potato DNA. Thus, these non-natural nucleotide junctions are composed of potato nucleotides, but these nucleotides are in a genetic arrangement that does not occur in nature, but which results from the manipulation of man that occurs during the genetic transformation of the potato.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Operably linked. Combining two or more molecules in such a fashion that in combination they function properly in a plant cell. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a structural gene when the promoter controls transcription of the structural gene.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Plant. As used herein, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; includes a monocot or a dicot. The word &#x201c;plant,&#x201d; as used herein, also encompasses plant cells, seed, plant progeny, propagule whether generated sexually or asexually, and descendants of any of these, such as cuttings or seed. Plant cells include suspension cultures, callus, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, seeds and microspores.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Plant Parts. As used herein, the term &#x201c;plant parts&#x201d; (or a potato plant, or a part thereof) includes but is not limited to protoplast, leaf, stem, root, root tip, anther, pistil, seed, embryo, pollen, ovule, cotyledon, hypocotyl, flower, tuber, eye, tissue, petiole, cell, meristematic cell, and the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Progeny. As used herein, includes an Fi potato plant produced from the cross of two potato plants where at least one plant includes the selected event and progeny further includes, but is not limited to, subsequent F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, F<sub>5</sub>, F<sub>6</sub>, F<sub>7</sub>, F<sub>8</sub>, F<sub>9</sub>, generations.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) refer to genetic loci that control to some degree numerically representable traits that are usually continuously distributed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Recombinant. As used herein, broadly describes various technologies whereby genes can be cloned, DNA can be sequenced, and protein products can be produced. As used herein, the term also describes proteins that have been produced following the transfer of genes into the cells of plant host systems.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Regeneration. Regeneration refers to the development of a plant from tissue culture.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Regulatory sequences. Refers to those sequences which are standard and known to those in the art that may be included in the expression vectors to increase and/or maximize transcription of a gene of interest or translation of the resulting RNA in a plant system. These include, but are not limited to, promoters, peptide export signal sequences, introns, polyadenylation, and transcription termination sites.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Selectable marker. A &#x201c;selectable marker&#x201d; is used to identify transformation events.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Specific gravity. As used herein, &#x201c;specific gravity&#x201d; is an expression of density and is a measurement of potato quality. There is a high correlation between the specific gravity of the tuber and the starch content and percentage of dry matter or total solids. A higher specific gravity contributes to higher recovery rate and better quality of the processed product.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Sequence identity. &#x201c;sequence identity&#x201d; or &#x201c;identity&#x201d; in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the number of residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have &#x201c;sequence similarity&#x201d; or &#x201c;similarity.&#x201d; Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, Computer Applic. Biol. Sci., 4:11-17 (1988). The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. An example of a local alignment algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST&#xae;) (Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-10), which is available from several sources, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, Md.) and on the Internet, for use in connection with the sequence analysis programs blastp, blastn, blastx, tblastn and tblastx. It can be accessed on the internet via the National Library of Medicine (NLM)'s world-wide-web URL. A description of how to determine sequence identity using this program is available at the NLM's website on BLAST tutorial. Another example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the global comparison of sequences is the Clustal W and Clustal X (Larkin et al. 2007 Bioinformatics, 23, 2947-294, Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0) as well as Clustal omega. Unless otherwise stated, references to sequence identity used herein refer to the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST&#xae;).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Total Yield. Total yield refers to the total weight of all harvested tubers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Transformation of plant cells. A process by which DNA is integrated into the genome of a plant cell. The integration may be transient or stable. &#x201c;Stably&#x201d; refers to the permanent, or non-transient retention and/or expression of a polynucleotide in and by a cell genome. Thus, a stably integrated polynucleotide is one that is a fixture within a transformed cell genome and can be replicated and propagated through successive progeny of the cell or resultant transformed plant. Transformation may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art. Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, including Agrobacterium-mediated transformation protocols, viral infection, whiskers, electroporation, heat shock, lipofection, polyethylene glycol treatment, micro-injection, and particle bombardment.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Transgenic plant. A genetically modified plant which contains at least one transgene.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Variant. A &#x201c;variant,&#x201d; as used herein, is understood to mean a nucleotide or amino acid sequence that deviates from the standard, or given, nucleotide or amino acid sequence of a particular gene or protein. The terms, &#x201c;isoform,&#x201d; &#x201c;isotype,&#x201d; and &#x201c;analog&#x201d; also refer to &#x201c;variant&#x201d; forms of a nucleotide or an amino acid sequence. An amino acid sequence that is altered by the addition, removal or substitution of one or more amino acids, or a change in nucleotide sequence, may be considered a &#x201c;variant&#x201d; sequence. The variant may have &#x201c;conservative&#x201d; changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. A variant may have &#x201c;nonconservative&#x201d; changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Analogous minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted may be found using computer programs well known in the art such as Vector NTI Suite (InforMax, Md.) software, CLC Genomics Workbench (Germantown, Md.) or EMBL-EBI online software.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Vine Maturity. Vine maturity refers to a plant's ability to continue to utilize carbohydrates and photosynthesize.

The disclosure further relates to methods of identifying plants having a resistant gene(s). The disclosure further relates to compositions for controlling plant pests and pathogens.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">The pathway to Resistance</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Early blight is a fungal disease common in potato and tomato plants. It is caused primarily by the fungus <i>Alternaria solani</i>, however other <i>Alternaria </i>species are known to infect plants, such as <i>A. alternata</i>. Early blight is generally observed on mature plants, or those weakened from dehydration or lack of nutrients, however it may also develop on seedlings. The disease manifests as black or brown lesions on leaves which expand with a yellow hallo and may have dark concentric rings (&#x201c;bullseye&#x201d; type spots). As the lesions expand it leads to defoliation due to the death of the affected leaves. As a result, infected plants produce sun-scalded as well as poor-colored fruits. Infected tubers present with dark-colored sunken lesions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Current treatment and prevention of early blight infection relies on chemical fungicides, such as Mancozeb and chlorothalonil. However, <i>A. solani </i>is becoming increasing resistant to some chemical fungicide treatments (Bauske, M. J., Mallik, I., Yellareddygari, S .K. R., and Gudmestad, N. C. 2018(a). Spatial and temporal distribution of mutations conferring QoI and SDHI resistance in <i>Alternaria solani </i>across the United States. <i>Plant Dis. </i>102:349-358).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">There are currently no commercial potato cultivars completely resistant to early blight. However, resistance has been observed in wild varieties of potato (<i>Solanum commersonii</i>). One such example is <i>S. commersonii </i>accession CGN18024_1.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><i>S. commersonii </i>CGN18024_1 was found to be resistant to four <i>Alternaria solani </i>isolates&#x2014;T2R3B, ConR4D, ConR2J and ConR1H. These <i>A. solani </i>isolates were collected in the US by Applicant, were sent for genome sequencing. The reads were assembled and comparison with the altNL03003 genome showed that the genomes were well assembled (&#x3e;95% of complete genome assembled, largest contigs &#x3e;2Mb). All 31 effector candidates, except AsEC1, were found back in the isolates from the US. Resistance to fungicides through mutations known to occur in <i>Alternaria </i>can also be assessed through these genome sequences.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Mapping the <i>A. solani </i>Resistant Trait</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">To fine map the resistance locus within <i>S. commersonii</i>, progeny of four intraspecies crosses (within <i>Solanum commersonii</i>) were tested for resistance to <i>Alternaria solani</i>. A clear segregation of resistance was found in the populations, and bulks of susceptible and resistant progeny for BSA-RNAseq analysis in the best-characterized population AJW12 (CGN1802_1&#xd7;CGN18024_3) were prepared. The remaining populations were also tested to confirm their phenotypes.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">RNA samples of the parents of population AJW12 as well as pools of resistant and susceptible progeny were sent for sequencing and the resulting sequences were analyzed. Putative SNPs linked to resistance were identified by aligning the RNAseq reads to the DMv3.04 genome, after which the SNPs were filtered to identify SNPs that are heterozygous only in the resistant parent and AJW12 progeny (being absent in the susceptible parent and susceptible progeny of AJW12). The filtered SNPs were plotted in windows of 100 Kb over the 12 potato chromosomes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). This analysis revealed that almost all filtered SNPs map to chromosome 12, indicating that resistance to <i>A. solani </i>is located on that chromosome.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, a selection of SNPs broadly covering chromosome 12 were used to develop markers for use in a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis to genotype the parents of AJW12 and a selection of 28 progeny genotypes (15 resistant and 13 susceptible). Doing so, SNP markers linked to resistance were identified. Moreover, 4 recombinants were found. This limited the genetic window for the resistance to the top of chromosome 12, between SNP markers &#x2018;B1&#x2019; and &#x2018;B3&#x2019;, corresponding to a region of approximately 3 Mb based on the homologous chromosome from the DMv4.03 genome (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).

Next, BUSCO was used to train Augustus gene prediction software to generate a draft gene prediction on the CGN18024_1 genome. Alignment of ONT reads from CGN18024_1 to the CGN18024_1 genome showed evidence for a structural rearrangement in the resistance region. The heterozygous nature of this rearrangement made it possible to separate ONT reads covering the different haplotypes, such that the resistant and susceptible haplotypes were assembled separately. These assemblies were then separately polished with DNB reads and aligned using nucmer. The analysis revealed a duplication of approximately 9.9 kb in the resistant haplotype (UTG_R). The corresponding (non-duplicated) region in the susceptible haplotype (UTG_S) contains an insertion of around 3.7 kb (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).

All resistant genotypes (18024_1 wt, 18024_3 GTR1, 18024_3 GTR2) contained tetraose glycoalkaloids (composed of an aglycone conjugated to an oligosaccharide containing 4 monosaccharide moieties), whereas susceptible genotypes (18024_3 wt) contain only triose glycoalkaloids (containing 3 monosaccharide moieties instead of 4), or very low levels of tetraose glycoalkaloids. Specifically, two distinct tetraoses were identified on glycoalkaloids of CGN18024_1: Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu and Gal-Glu- Glu-Xyl. Interestingly, the ScGTR1 transformants contain only Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu-alkaloids, whereas ScGTR2 transformants contain almost exclusively Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl alkaloids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).

Following co-culture and T-DNA delivery, the plant cells are often treated with bacteriocidal and-or bacteriostatic agents to kill the <i>Agrobacterium. </i></p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">Although transgenic plants produced through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation generally contain a simple integration pattern as compared to microparticle-mediated genetic transformation, a wide variation in copy number and insertion patterns exists (Jones et al, 1987; Jorgensen et al., 1987). Moreover, even within a single plant genotype, different patterns of transfer DNA integration are possible based on the type of explant and transformation system used (Grevelding et al., 1993). Factors that regulate transfer DNA copy number are poorly understood.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">B. Direct Gene Transfer</heading><p id="p-0156" num="0153">Direct plant transformation methods using DNA have also been reported. The first of these to be reported historically is electroporation, which utilizes an electrical current applied to a solution containing plant cells (M. E. Fromm et al., Nature, 319, 791 (1986); H. Jones et al., Plant Mol. Biol., 13, 501 (1989) and H. Yang et al., Plant Cell Reports, 7, 421 (1988).</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154">Another direct method, called &#x201c;biolistic bombardment&#x201d;, uses ultrafine particles, usually tungsten or gold, that are coated with DNA and then sprayed onto the surface of a plant tissue with sufficient force to cause the particles to penetrate plant cells, including the thick cell wall, membrane and nuclear envelope, but without killing at least some of them (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,204,253, US 5,015,580).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0155">A third direct method uses fibrous forms of metal or ceramic consisting of sharp, porous or hollow needle-like projections that literally impale the cells, and also the nuclear envelope of cells. Both silicon carbide and aluminum borate whiskers have been used for plant transformation (Mizuno et al., 2004; Petolino et al., 2000; US5302523 US Application 20040197909) and also for bacterial and animal transformation (Kaepler et al., 1992; Raloff, 1990; Wang, 1995).

The transgenic variety could then be crossed with another (non-transformed or transformed) variety in order to produce a new transgenic variety. Alternatively, a genetic trait that has been engineered into a particular plant line using the foregoing transformation techniques could be moved into another line using traditional backcrossing techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move an engineered trait from a public, non-elite variety into an elite variety, or from a variety containing a foreign gene in its genome into a variety or varieties that do not contain that gene.

For example, the GAANTRY system (Gene Assembly in <i>Agrobacterium </i>by Nucleic acid Transfer using Recombinase technologY) leverages recombinase-mediated stacking technology. The specificity and efficiency of recombinases make them extremely attractive for genome engineering. Advancements in molecular biology and recombinases have paved the way for gene stacking with the assistance of unidirectional recombination systems. Development of this high-efficiency gene stacking system uses the specificity of the recombinases to effectively deliver the target genes of interest to a predetermined position. This is a flexible and effective system for stably stacking multiple genes within an <i>Agrobacterium </i>virulence plasmid Transfer-DNA (T-DNA).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0169"><i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation of plants with one or a few genes is relatively routine, but the assembly and transformation of large constructs carrying multiple genes and their efficient use to generate high-quality transgenic plants has been a challenge.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0170">The present disclosure teaches GAANTRY, which is a flexible and effective system for stably stacking multiple genes within an <i>Agrobacterium </i>virulence plasmid Transfer-DNA (T-DNA). This GAANTRY system is well described in Collier, R. et al (2018), Plant Journal 95, 573-583 and McCue et al (2019) BMC Research Notes 12, 457, each of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">The GAANTRY system is based on the combined use of unidirectional integration and excision controlled by three site-specific serine recombinases, which is an effective and stable system for stacking multiple genes within an <i>Agrobacterium </i>virulence plasmid T-DNA. The gene stacking system utilizes &#x2018;P-Donor&#x2019; and &#x2018;B-Donor&#x2019; cloning vectors, and &#x2018;P-Helper&#x2019; and &#x2018;B-Helper&#x2019; vectors, for the insertion of sequences of interest. The P-Donor and B-Donor vectors contain either attP or attB, respectively, recognition sites enabling precise integration into the virulence plasmid of the GAANTRY ArPORT1 strain. Plant transformation with T-DNA expressed from a GAANTRY modified <i>Agrobacterium </i>can produce high quality events that contain low copies of a complete T-DNA with limited incorporation of vector &#x2018;backbone&#x2019; sequences (Collier, 2018).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">The resulting engineered <i>Agrobacterium </i>strain can be directly used for plant transformation.

Within the genus <i>Solanum</i>, over a thousand species have been recognized. Potatoes will not hybridize with non-tuber bearing <i>Solanum </i>(tomato, eggplant, etc.) species including weeds commonly found in and around commercial potato fields (Love 1994).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">The genus <i>Solanum </i>is divided into several subsections, of which the subsection potato contains all tuber-bearing potatoes. The subsection potato is divided into series, of which tuberosa is relevant to this document. Within the series <i>tuberosa </i>approximately 54 species of wild and cultivated potatoes are found. One of these is <i>S. tuberosum. </i></p><p id="p-0180" num="0177"><i>S. tuberosum </i>is divided into two subspecies: <i>tuberosum </i>and <i>andigena</i>. The subspecies <i>tuberosum </i>is the cultivated potato widely in use as a crop plant in, for example, North America and Europe. The subspecies <i>andigena </i>is also a cultivated species, but cultivation is restricted to Central and South America (Hanneman 1994). Z. Huam&#xe1;n and D. M. Spooner reclassified all cultivated potatoes as a single species, <i>S. tuberosum</i>, with various groups, including a Tuberosum Group (<i>S. tuberosum </i>subsp. <i>Tuberosum</i>) for the modern cultivars (Huam&#xe1;n et al., Am. J. of Botany 89(6): 947-965. 2002)</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">The only two wild potato species that grow within the borders of the USA, and for which specimens exist in gene banks, include the tetraploid species <i>S. fendleri </i>(recently reclassified as <i>S. stoloniferum</i>; however, some sources, including the Inter-genebank Potato Database, still use the <i>S. fendleri </i>designation) and the diploid species <i>S. jamesii </i>(Bamberg et al. 2003; IPD 2011; Bamberg and del Rio 2011a; Bamberg and del Rio 2011b; Spooner et al. 2004). Love (1994) reported that a third species, <i>S. pinnatisectum</i>, is also a native species in the USA. However, Spooner et al. (2004) determined that what was previously thought to be <i>S. pinnatisectum </i>was in fact <i>S. jamesii</i>. Through more than 10 years of field work and assessments of existing records, Bamberg et al. (2003) and Spooner et al. (2004) established the presence of only these two species, <i>S. fendleri </i>and <i>S. jamesii</i>, in the U.S. These researchers also attempted to verify previously recorded locations, and through this process, updated the maps of current known locations of these species, providing latitude and longitude locations for each documented population (Bamberg et al. 2003) and distribution maps (Spooner et al. 2004). These species mostly reside in dry forests, scrub desert, and sandy areas at altitudes of 5,000 to 10,000 feet, well isolated from most commercial production areas (Bamberg and del Rio 2011a).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">While there is some overlap between the acreage used for commercial production and occurrence of wild species on a county level, the majority of the potato production in the United States is not in wild potato zones. However, there is a possibility that a few wild potato plants may be growing near potato fields (Love 1994). Spooner et al. (2004) describe <i>S. jamesii </i>habitat in the U.S. as among boulders on hillsides, sandy alluvial stream bottoms, in gravel along trails or roadways, rich organic soil of alluvial valleys, sandy fallow fields, grasslands, juniper-pinyon scrub deserts, oak thicket, coniferous and deciduous forests at elevations between 4,500 to 9,400 feet.

This research requires large investments of time, labor, and money. The development of a potato cultivar can often take a long time (up to eight years or more) from greenhouse to commercial usage. Breeding begins with careful selection of superior parents to incorporate the most important characteristics into the progeny. Since all desired traits usually do not appear with just one cross, breeding must be cumulative.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">Present breeding techniques continue with the controlled pollination of parental clones. Typically, pollen is collected in gelatin capsules for later use in pollinating the female parents. Hybrid seeds are sown in greenhouses and tubers are harvested and retained from thousands of individual seedlings. The next year one to four tubers from each resulting seedling are planted in the field, where extreme caution is exercised to avoid the spread of virus and diseases. From this first-year seedling crop, several &#x201c;seed&#x201d; tubers from each hybrid individual which survived the selection process are retained for the next year's planting. After the second year, samples are taken for density measurements and fry tests to determine the suitability of the tubers for commercial usage. Plants which have survived the selection process to this point are then planted at an expanded volume the third year for a more comprehensive series of fry tests and density determinations. At the fourth-year stage of development, surviving selections are subjected to field trials in several states to determine their adaptability to different growing conditions. Eventually, the varieties having superior qualities are transferred to other farms and the seed increased to commercial scale. Generally, by this time, eight or more years of planting, harvesting and testing have been invested in attempting to develop the new and improved potato cultivars.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">Backcrossing methods can be used with the present disclosure to improve or introduce a characteristic into the variety. The term &#x201c;backcrossing&#x201d; as used herein refers to the repeated crossing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more times of a hybrid progeny back to the recurrent parents. The parental potato plant which contributes the gene(s) for the one or more desired characteristics is termed the nonrecurrent or donor parent. This terminology refers to the fact that the nonrecurrent parent is used one time in the backcross protocol and therefore does not recur. The parental potato plant to which the gene or genes from the nonrecurrent parent are transferred is known as the recurrent parent as it is used for several rounds in the backcrossing protocol. In a typical backcross protocol, the original variety of interest (recurrent parent) is crossed to a second variety (nonrecurrent parent) that carries the gene(s) of interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a potato plant is obtained wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the one or more genes transferred from the nonrecurrent parent.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0190">The selection of a suitable recurrent parent is an important step for a successful backcrossing procedure. The goal of a backcross protocol is to alter or substitute one or more traits or characteristics in the original variety. To accomplish this, one or more genes of the recurrent variety are modified, substituted or supplemented with the desired gene(s) from the nonrecurrent parent, while retaining essentially all of the rest of the desired genes, and therefore the desired physiological and morphological constitution of the original variety. The choice of the particular nonrecurrent parent will depend on the purpose of the backcross. One of the major purposes is to add some commercially desirable, agronomically important trait to the plant. The exact backcrossing protocol will depend on the characteristic or trait being altered or added to determine an appropriate testing protocol. Although backcrossing methods are simplified when the characteristic being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele may also be transferred. In this instance, it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired characteristic has been successfully transferred.</p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Molecular Techniques</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0191">With the advent of molecular biological techniques that have allowed the isolation and characterization of genes that encode specific protein products, scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genes, or additional, or modified versions of native, or endogenous, genes (perhaps driven by different promoters) in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Such foreign additional and/or modified genes are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;transgenes&#x201d;. Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present disclosure, in particular embodiments, also relates to transformed versions of the claimed variety or line.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">Plant transformation involves the construction of an expression vector which will function in plant cells. Such a vector comprises DNA comprising a gene under control of, or operatively linked to, a regulatory element (for example, a promoter). The expression vector may contain one or more such operably linked gene/regulatory element combinations. The vector(s) may be in the form of a plasmid, and can be used alone or in combination with other plasmids, to provide transformed plants, using transformation methods as described below to incorporate transgenes into the genetic material of the plant(s).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">Traditional plant breeding typically relies on the random recombination of plant chromosomes to create varieties that have new and improved characteristics. According to standard, well-known techniques, genetic &#x201c;expression cassettes,&#x201d; comprising genes and regulatory elements, are inserted within the borders of Agrobacterium-isolated transfer DNAs (&#x201c;T-DNAs&#x201d;) and integrated into plant genomes. Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of T-DNA material typically comprises the following standard procedures: (1) in vitro recombination of genetic elements, to produce an expression cassette for selection of transformation, (2) insertion of this expression cassette, often together with at least one other expression cassette into a T-DNA region of a binary vector, (3) transfer of the sequences located between the T-DNA borders, often accompanied with some or all of the additional binary vector sequences from Agrobacterium to the plant cell, and (4) selection of stably transformed plant cells that display a desired trait, such as an increase in yield, improved vigor, enhanced resistance to diseases and insects, or greater ability to survive under stress.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0194">In some embodiments, genetic engineering methods may rely on the introduction of foreign, not-endogenous nucleic acids, including regulatory elements such as promoters and terminators, and genes that are involved in the expression of a new trait or function as markers for identification and selection of transformants, from viruses, bacteria and plants.

The infiltrated spots were inoculated with spores from <i>A. solani </i>two days after agroinfiltration. Sizes of the lesions were measured 5 days post inoculation as a measure for disease resistance.

Thus, these data indicate that ScGTR1 is responsible for the glucosylation of a triose glycoalkaloid precursor in <i>S. commersonii</i>, while ScGTR2 catalyses xylosilation of the same substrate.

Moreover, the glycoalkaloids from <i>S. commersonii </i>and <i>S. tuberosum </i>have identical precursors (i.e. the solanidine aglycone).
