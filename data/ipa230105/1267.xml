id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method is disclosed for using an artificial intelligence engine to modify resistance of pedals of an exercise device. The method includes generating, by the artificial intelligence engine, a machine learning model trained to receive measurements as input, and outputting, based on the measurements, a control instruction that causes the exercise device to modify, independently from each other, the resistance of the pedals. While a user performs an exercise using the exercise device, the method includes receiving the measurements from sensors associated with the pedals. The method includes determining, based on the measurements, a quantifiable or qualitative modification to the resistance provided by a pedal of the pedals. The resistance provided by another pedal of the pedals is not modified. The method includes transmitting the control instruction to the exercise device to cause the resistance provided by the pedal to be modified.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

A user may perform an exercise (e.g., cycling, balancing, bench press, pull down, arm curl, etc.) using the osteogenic isometric exercise, rehabilitation, and/or strength training equipment to improve osteogenesis, bone growth, bone density, muscular hypertrophy, flexibility, balance, coordination, reduce pain, decrease rehabilitation time, increase strength, or some combination thereof. The isometric exercise, rehabilitation, and/or strength training equipment may include moveable portions onto which the user adds a load or balances. For example, to perform a cycling exercise, the user may sit in a seat, place each of the user's feet on a respective pedal of an cycling machine, and push on the pedals with the user's feet while each of the pedals rotate in a circular motion. To perform a balancing exercise, the user may stand on a balance board and balance on top of the balance board as it shifts in one or more directions. The isometric exercise, rehabilitation, and/or strength training equipment may include non-movable portions onto which the user adds load. For example, to perform a leg-press-style exercise, the user may sit in a seat, place each of the user's feet on a respective foot plate, and push on the feet plates with the user's feet while the foot plates remain in the same position.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Representative embodiments set forth herein disclose various techniques for an adjustment of exercise based on artificial intelligence, exercise plan, and user feedback.

Such, growth, however, typically stops at approximately age 30. After that point, without interventions as described herein, bone loss (called osteoporosis), can start to occur. This does not mean that the body stops creating new bone. Rather, it means that the rate at which it creates new bone tends to slow, while the rate at which bone loss occurs tends to increase.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, as people age and/or become less active than they once were, they may experience muscle loss. For example, muscles that are not used often may reduce in muscle mass. As a result, the muscles become weaker. In some instances, people may be affected by a disease, such as muscular dystrophy, that causes the muscles to become progressively weaker and to have reduced muscle mass. To increase the muscle mass and/or reduce the rate of muscle loss, people may exercise a muscle to cause muscular hypertrophy, thereby strengthening the muscle as the muscle grows. Muscular hypertrophy may refer to an increase in a size of skeletal muscle through a growth in size of its component cells. There are two factors that contribute to muscular hypertrophy, (i) sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (increase in muscle glycogen storage), and (ii) myofibrillar hypertrophy (increase in myofibril size). The growth in the cells may be caused by an adaptive response that serves to increase an ability to generate force or resist fatigue.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The rate at which such bone or muscle loss occurs generally accelerates as people age. A net growth in bone can ultimately become a net loss in bone, longitudinally across time. By the time, in general, women are over 50 and men are over 70, net bone loss can reach a point where brittleness of the bones is so great that the risk of life-altering fractures can occur. Examples of such fractures include fractures of the hip and femur. Of course, fractures can also occur due to participation in athletics or due to accidents. In such cases, it is just as relevant to have a need for bone growth which heals or speeds the healing of the fracture.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">To understand why such fractures occur, it is useful to recognize that bone is itself porous, with a somewhat-honeycomb like structure. This structure may be dense and therefore stronger or it may be variegated, spread out and/or sparse, such latter structure being incapable of continuously or continually supporting the weight (load) stresses experienced in everyday living. When such loads exceed the support capability of the structure at a stressor point or points, a fracture occurs. This is true whether the individual had a fragile bone structure or a strong one: it is a matter of physics, of the literal &#x201c;breaking point.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">It is therefore preferable to have a means of mitigating or ameliorating bone loss and of healing fractures. Further, it is preferable to encourage new bone growth, thus increasing the density of the structure described hereinabove. The increased bone density may increase the load-bearing capacities of the bone, thus making first or subsequent fractures less likely to occur. Reduced fractures may improve a quality of life of the individual. The process of bone growth itself is referred to as osteogenesis, literally the creation of bone.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">It is also preferable to have a means for mitigating or ameliorating muscle mass loss and weakening of the muscles. Further, it is preferable to encourage muscle growth by increasing the muscle mass through exercise. The increased muscle mass may enable a person to exert more force with the muscle and/or to resist fatigue in the muscle for a longer period of time.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In order to create new bone, at least three factors are necessary. First, the individual must have a sufficient intake of calcium, but second, in order to absorb that calcium, the individual must have a sufficient intake and absorption of Vitamin D, a matter problematic for those who have cystic fibrosis, who have undergone gastric bypass surgery or have other absorption disorders or conditions which limit absorption. Separately, supplemental estrogen for women and supplemental testosterone for men can further ameliorate bone loss. On the other hand, abuse of alcohol and smoking can harm one's bone structure. Medical conditions such as, without limitation, rheumatoid arthritis, renal disease, overactive parathyroid glands, diabetes or organ transplants can also exacerbate osteoporosis. Ethical pharmaceuticals such as, without limitation, hormone blockers, seizure medications and glucocorticoids are also capable of inducing such exacerbations. But even in the absence of medical conditions as described hereinabove, Vitamin D and calcium taken together do not create osteogenesis to a desirable degree or ameliorate bone loss to a desirable degree.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">To achieve osteogenesis, therefore, one must add in the third factor: exercise. Specifically, one must subject one's bones to a force at least equal to certain multiple of body weight, such multiples varying depending on the individual and the specific bone in question. As used herein, &#x201c;MOB&#x201d; means Multiples of Body Weight. It has been determined through research that subjecting a given bone to a certain threshold MOB (this may also be known as a &#x201c;weight-bearing exercise&#x201d;), even for an extremely short period of time, one simply sufficient to exceed the threshold MOB, encourages and fosters osteogenesis in that bone.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, a person can achieve muscular hypertrophy by exercising the muscles for which increased muscle mass is desired. Strength training and/or resistance exercise may cause muscle tissue to increase. For example, pushing against or pulling on a stationary object with a certain amount of force may trigger the cells in the associated muscle to change and cause the muscle mass to increase.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments disclosed herein, a control system for an exercise machine is disclosed, not only capable of enabling an individual, preferably an older, less mobile individual or preferably an individual recovering from a fracture, to engage easily in osteogenic exercises and/or muscle strengthening exercises, but capable of using predetermined thresholds or dynamically calculating them, such that the person using the machine can be immediately informed through real-time visual and/or other sensorial feedback, that the osteogenic threshold has been exceeded, thus triggering osteogenesis for the subject bone (or bones), and/or that the muscular strength threshold has been exceeded, thereby triggering muscular hypertrophy for the subject muscle (or muscles). The control system may be used to improve compliance with an exercise plan including one or more exercises.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The control system may receive one or more load measurements associated with forces exerted by both the left and right sides on left and right portions (e.g., handles, foot plate or platform) of the exercise machine to enhance osteogenesis, bone growth, bone density improvement, and/or muscle mass. The one or more load measurements may be a left load measurement of a load added to a left load cell on a left portion of the exercise machine and a right load measurement of a load added to a right load cell on a right portion of the exercise machine. A user interface may be provided by the control system that presents visual representations of the separately measured left load and right load where the respective left load and right load are added to the respective left load cell and right load cell at the subject portions of the exercise machine.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, initially, the control system may receive load measurements via a data channel associated with each exercise of the machine. For example, there may be a data channel for a leg-press-style exercise, a pull-down-style exercise, a suitcase-lift-style exercise, an arm-curl-style exercise, and so forth. Each data channel may include one or more load cells (e.g., a left load cell and a right load cell) that measure added load or applied force and transmit the load measurement to the control system via its respective data channel. The control system may receive the load measurements from each of the data channels at a first rate (e.g., 1 Hertz). If the control system detects a load from a data channel (e.g., hands resting on the handles including the respective load cells, or feet resting on the feet plate including the respective load cells), the control system may set that data channel as active and start reading load measurements from that data channel at a second rate (e.g., 10 Hertz) that is higher than the first rate. Further, the control system may set the other exercises associated with the other data channels as inactive and stop reading load measurements from the other data channels until the active exercise is complete. The active exercise may be complete when the one or more load measurements received via the data channel exceed one or more target thresholds. In some embodiments, the control system may determine an average load measurement by accumulating raw load measurements over a certain period of time (e.g., 5 seconds) and averaging the raw load measurements to smooth the data (e.g., eliminates jumps or spikes in data) in an average load measurement.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The control system may compare the one or more load measurements (e.g., raw load measurements, or averaged load measurements) to one or more target thresholds. In some embodiments, a single load measurement may be compared to a single specific target threshold (e.g., a one-to-one relationship). In some embodiments, a single load measurement may be compared to more than one specific target threshold (e.g., a one-to-many relationship). In some embodiments, more than one load measurement may be compared to a single specific target threshold (e.g., a many-to-one relationship). In some embodiments, more than one load measurement may be compared to more than one specific target threshold (e.g., a many-to-many relationship).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The target thresholds may be an osteogenesis target threshold, a muscular strength target threshold, and/or a rehabilitation threshold. The osteogenesis target threshold may be determined based on a disease protocol pertaining to the user, an age of the user, a gender of the user, a sex of the user, a height of the user, a weight of the user, a bone density of the user, etc. A disease protocol may refer to any illness, disease, fracture, or ailment experienced by the user and any treatment instructions provided by a caretaker for recovery and/or healing. The disease protocol may also include a condition of health where the goal is avoid a problem. The muscular strength target threshold may be determined based on a historical performance of the user using the exercise machine (e.g., amount of pounds lifted for a particular exercise, amount of force applied associated with each body part, etc.) and/or other exercise machines, a fitness level (e.g., how active the user is) of the user, a diet of the user, a protocol for determining a muscular strength target, etc. The rehabilitation target threshold may be determined based on historical performance of the user using the exercise machine (e.g., amount of force applied associated with each body part, speed of cycling, level of stability, etc.) and/or other exercise machines, a fitness level (e.g., how active the user is, the flexibility of the user, etc.) of the user, a diet of the user, an exercise plan for determining a rehabilitation target, the condition of the user (e.g., type of surgery the user underwent, the type of injury the user sustained), physical characteristics of the user (e.g., an age of the user, a gender of the user, a sex of the user, a height of the user, a weight of the user, a bone density of the user), condition of the user's body part(s) (e.g., the pain level of a user), an exertion level of a user (e.g., how easy/hard the exercise session is for the user), any other suitable characteristic, or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The control system may determine whether the one or more load measurements exceed the one or more target thresholds. Responsive to determining that the one or more load measurements exceed the one or more target thresholds, the control system may cause a user interface to present an indication that the one or more target thresholds have been exceeded and an exercise is complete. Additionally, when the one or more target thresholds are exceeded, the control system may cause the user interface to present an indication that instructs the user to apply additional force (less than a safety limit) to attempt to set a personal maximum record of weight lifted, pressed, pulled, or otherwise exert force thereupon for that exercise.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, the user interface may present an indication when a load measurement is approaching a target threshold for the user. In another example, when the load measurement exceeds the target threshold, the user interface may present an indication that the target threshold has been exceeded, that the exercise is complete, and if there are any remaining incomplete exercises in the exercise plan, that there is another exercise to be completed by the user. If there are no remaining exercises in the exercise plan to complete, then the user interface may present an indication that all exercises in the exercise plan are complete and the user can rest. In addition, when the exercise plan is complete, the control system may generate a performance report that presents various information (e.g., charts and graphs of the right and left load measurements received during each of the exercises, left and right maximum loads for the user received during each of the exercises, historical right and left load measurements received in the past, comparison of the current right and left load measurements with the historical right and left load measurement, an amount of pounds lifted or pressed that is determined based on the load measurements for each of the exercises, percent gained in load measurements over time, etc.).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, the one or more load measurements may each be compared to a safety limit. For example, a left load measurement and a right load measurement may each be compared to the safety limit for the user. The safety limit may be determined for the user based on the user's disease protocol. There may be different safety limits for different portions of the user's body on the left and the right side, one extremity versus another extremity, a top portion of the user's body and a body portion of the user's body, etc., and for different exercises. For example, if someone underwent left knee surgery, the safety limit for a user for a left load measurement for a leg-press-style exercise may be different from the safety limit for a right load measurement for that exercise and user. If the safety limit is exceeded, an indication may be presented on the user interface to instruct to reduce the amount of force the user is applying and/or to instruct the user to stop applying force because the safety limit is exceeded.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">For those with any or all of the osteoporosis-exacerbating medical conditions described herein, such a control system and exercise machine can slow the rate of net bone loss by enabling osteogenesis to occur without exertions which would not be possible for someone whose health is fragile, not robust. Another benefit of the present disclosure, therefore, is its ability to speed the healing of fractures in athletically robust individuals. Further, another benefit is the increase in muscle mass by using the exercise machine to trigger muscular hypertrophy. The control system may provide an automated interface that improves compliance with an exercise plan by using a real-time feedback loop to measure loads added during each of the exercises, compare the load measurements to target thresholds and/or safety limits that are uniquely determined for the user using the exercise machine, and provide various indications based on the comparison. For example, the indications pertain to when the user should add more load, when the target thresholds are exceeded, when the safety limit is exceeded, when the exercise is complete, when the user should begin another exercise, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Bone Exercises and their Benefits</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The following exercises achieve bone strengthening results by exposing relevant parts of a user to isometric forces which are selected multiples of body weight (MOB) of the user, a threshold level above which bone mineral density increases. A MOB may be any fraction or rational number excluding zero. The specific MOB-multiple threshold necessary to effect such increases will naturally vary from individual to individual and may be more or less for any given individual. &#x201c;Bone-strengthening,&#x201d; as used herein, specifically includes, without limitation, a process of osteogenesis, whether due to the creation of new bone as a result of an increase in the bone mineral density; or proximately to the introduction or causation of microfractures in the underlying bone.

For example, a person may require a certain amount of muscle mass to move an object having a particular weight. While the physical activity may be desirable, some people may lack the appropriate bone mass, muscle mass, or physical ability in general to perform the physical activity. In one example, a grandparent may desire to play with their grandchildren, and may want to select that physical activity as a goal. However, the grandparent may not be aware of what levels of attainment are associated with the physical activity goal of playing with their grandchildren. As used herein, levels of attainment may refer to any physical, emotional, intellectual or other quality associated with such attainment, e.g., strength, endurance, balance, intelligence, neurological responsiveness, emotional well-being, range of motion, and mobility. A user may lack the proper knowledge, training, and/or education to determine which exercises to perform to target appropriate body portions used, for example, to achieve the appropriate levels of attainment to be able to play with their grandchildren. Further, another problem that users may experience is the ability to determine when the user may be at risk for having or developing various comorbitities in a real-time or near real-time manner. Such knowledge may be useful for a user to prevent the comorbidity from arising and/or to encourage or suggest to a user to consult with a health professional to take preventative care measures.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Accordingly, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a technical solution for enabling a user to select one or more physical activity goals they desire to achieve and for generating an improved exercise plan that enables the user to achieve the one or more physical activity goals. The system may use an artificial intelligence engine to generate machine learning models that use one or more curated, multi-disciplinary data sources to generate the improved exercise plan. A given data source may include associations between the selected physical activity goal and one or more levels of attainment pertaining to achieving the physical life goal, associations between the one or more levels of attainment and one or more body portions, and associations between the one or more body portions and one or more exercises that target the one or more body portions. Using the data source, the artificial intelligence engine may generate a machine learning model to use the associations to generate improved exercise plans. Further, a machine learning model may be trained to predict a length of time it will take a user, if they follow the improved exercise plan, to achieve their physical activity life goal.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The levels of attainment may be objectively monitored and/or measured using various performance measurements from one or more sensors, characteristics of users of the exercise machine, user-reported difficulty levels of exercises, user-reported pain levels, and the like. An onboarding protocol may be used to establish a baseline describing a fitness level of the user, and the fitness level of the user, in the improved exercise plan, may be used to select difficulty levels of exercises. A machine learning model may be trained to perform the onboarding protocol and to determine the fitness level of the user. The improved exercise plan may be dynamically updated based on characteristics of the user, selected physical activity levels, performance measurements, user-reported difficulties of the exercises, user-reported pain levels, and the like. In some embodiments, to comply with the exercise plan, the exercise machine may be controlled using a signal that indicates changing an attribute of an operating parameter of the exercise machine. The control system may change the attribute of the operating parameter in response to receiving the signal.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, numerous enhanced user interfaces may be used to enable the user to create a profile, select physical activity goals, view generated improved exercise plans, perform exercises, view/listen to multimedia regarding the exercises, provider user-reported feedback, view comorbidity information, view evidential trails for the comorbidity information and the exercise plans, control the exercise machine, and the like. The user interfaces may present information in a beneficial manner, especially on a small screen used by mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets), such that the user is presented with pertinent information without having to drill down into numerous other user interfaces or to open up different applications or websites. Accordingly, the enhanced user interface may improve the user's experience using a computing device, thus providing a technical improvement to computing technology.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the present disclosure.

As depicted, the user is the gripping second pair of load handles <b>106</b>. A left load cell <b>110</b> and a right load cell <b>110</b> may be located at a left load handle <b>106</b> and a right load handle <b>106</b>, respectively, in the second pair of load handles <b>106</b>. The user may push on the second pair of load handles <b>106</b> to add load to the left load cell <b>110</b> and the right load cell <b>110</b>. The left load cell <b>110</b> may transmit a left load measurement to the computing device <b>12</b>, and the right load cell <b>110</b> may transmit a right load measurement to the computing device <b>12</b>. The computing device <b>12</b> may use the load measurements to provide various real-time feedback on the user interface <b>18</b> as the user performs the chest-press-style exercise.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In general, the user interface <b>18</b> may present real-time visual feedback of the current load measurements or the current forces corresponding to the load measurements, a weight in pounds associated with the load measurements, incentive messages that encourage the user to exceed target thresholds (e.g., to trigger osteogenesis and/or muscular hypertrophy) and/or set personal records for maximum loads, historical performance of the user performing the exercise, and/or scripted prompts that display images of one or more body portions indicating proper technique for performing the exercise. The control system may provide various multimedia (visual, audio), and/or haptic feedback to encourage the user to exceed their target thresholds.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Initially, when the user has not added load onto any portion of the exercise machine <b>100</b> including one or more load cells <b>110</b>, the computing device <b>12</b> may be operating in an idle mode. During the idle mode, the computing device <b>12</b> may be receiving load measurements at a first frequency from each data channel associated with an exercise. For example, there may be four data channels, one for each of a chest-press-style exercise, a leg-press-style exercise, a suitcase-lift-style exercise, and a pulldown-style exercise. Although four data channels are described for explanatory purposes, it should be understood that there may be any suitable number of data channels, where &#x201c;any&#x201d; refers to one or more. Each data channel may provide load measurements to the computing device <b>12</b> from a respective left load cell and a respective right load cell that are located at the portion of the exercise machine <b>100</b> where the user pushes or pulls for the respective exercises. The user interface <b>18</b> may present the load measurement from each left and right load cells (e.g., 8 load measurements for the 4 data channels associated with the 4 exercises). Further, any target thresholds and/or safety limits for the user performing the exercises may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> during the idle mode. For example, a left target threshold, a right target load threshold, a safety limit, and/or a total weight target threshold for each of the exercises may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> during the idle mode.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">If the computing device <b>12</b> detects a minimum threshold amount of load (e.g., at least 10 pound-force (lbf)) added onto any of the load cells, the computing device switches from an idle mode to an exercise mode. The data channel including the load cell that sent the detected load measurement may be set to active by the computing device <b>12</b>. Further, the computing device <b>12</b> may set the other data channels to inactive and may stop receiving load measurements from the load cells corresponding to the inactive data channels. The computing device <b>12</b> may begin reading data from the load cells at the active data channel at a second frequency higher (e.g., high frequency data collection) than the first frequency when the computing device <b>12</b> was operating in the idle mode. Further, the user interface <b>18</b> may switch to presenting information pertaining to the exercise associated with the active data channel and stop presenting information pertaining to the exercises associated with the inactive data channels.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, the user may grip the second pair of handles <b>106</b> and apply force. The computing device <b>12</b> may detect the load from the load cells <b>110</b> located at the second pair of handles <b>106</b> and may set the data channel associated with the chest-press-style exercise to active to begin high frequency data collection from the load cells <b>110</b> via the active data channel.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">As depicted, the user interface <b>18</b> presents a left load measurement <b>1000</b> as a left force and a right load measurement <b>1002</b> as a right force in real-time or near real-time as the user is pressing on the second pair of handles <b>106</b>. The values of the forces for the left load measurement <b>1000</b> and the right load measurement <b>1002</b> are presented. There are separate visual representations for the left load measurement <b>1000</b> and the right load measurement <b>1002</b>. In some embodiments, these load measurements <b>1000</b> and <b>1002</b> may be represented in a bar char, line chart, graph, or any suitable visual representation. In some embodiments, a left target threshold and a right target threshold for the user may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, there may be more than one left target threshold and more than one right target threshold. For example, the left target thresholds may relate to an osteogenesis target threshold determined using a user's disease protocol and/or a muscular strength target threshold determined using a historical performance of the user for a particular exercise. The right target thresholds may relate to an osteogenesis target threshold determined using a user's disease protocol and/or a muscular strength target threshold determined using a historical performance of the user for a particular exercise. For example, if the user fractured their left arm and is rehabilitating the left arm, but the user's right arm is healthy, the left osteogenesis target threshold may be different from the right osteogenesis target threshold.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">If the left load measurement <b>1000</b> exceeds any of the left target thresholds, an indication (e.g., starburst) may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> indicating that the particular left target threshold has been exceeded and/or osteogenesis and/or muscular hypertrophy has been triggered in one or more portions of the body. If the right load measurement <b>1002</b> exceeds any of the right target thresholds, an indication (e.g., starburst) may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> indicating that the particular right target threshold has been exceeded and/or osteogenesis and/or muscular hypertrophy has been triggered in another portion of the body. Further, if either or both of the left and right target thresholds are exceeded, the indication may indicate that the exercise is complete and a congratulatory message may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, another message may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> that encourages the user to continue adding load to set a new personal maximum left load measurement and/or right load measurement for the exercise.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments, there may be a single target threshold to which both the left load measurement and the right load measurement are compared. If either of the left or right load measurement exceed the single target threshold, the above-described indication may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In some embodiments, there may be a single safety limit to which the left and right load measurements are compared. The single safety limit may be determined based on the user's disease protocol (e.g., what type of disease the user has, a severity of the disease, an age of the user, the height of the user, the weight of the user, what type of injury the user sustained, what type of surgery the user underwent, the portion of the body affected by the disease, the exercise plan to rehabilitate the user's body, instructions from a caregiver, etc.). If either or both of the left and right load measurements exceed the single safety limit, an indication may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. The indication may warn the user that the safety limit has been exceeded and recommend to reduce the amount of load added to the load cells <b>110</b> associated with the exercise being performed by the user.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments, more than one safety limit may be used. For example, if the user is rehabilitating a left leg, but a right leg is healthy, there may be a left safety limit that is determined for the left leg based on the user's disease protocol and there may be a right safety limit for the left leg determined based on the user's disease protocol. The left load measurement may be compared to the left safety limit, and the right load measurement may be compared to the right safety limit. If either or both the left load measurement and/or the right load measurement exceed the left safety limit and/or the right safety limit, respectively, an indication may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. The indication may warn the user that the respective safety limit has been exceeded and recommend to reduce the amount of load added to the load cells <b>110</b> associated with the exercise being performed by the user.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Further, a total weight <b>1004</b> in pounds that is determined based on the left and right load measurements is presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. The total weight <b>1004</b> may dynamically change as the user adds load onto the load cells <b>110</b>. A target weight <b>1006</b> for the exercise for the current day is also presented. This target weight <b>1006</b> may be determined based on the user's historical performance for the exercise. If the total weight <b>1004</b> exceeds the target weight <b>1006</b>, an indication (e.g., starburst) may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> indicating that osteogenesis and/or muscular hypertrophy has been triggered.

In some embodiments, another message may be presented on the user interface <b>18</b> that encourages the user to continue adding load to set a new personal maximum record for the exercise.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Additionally, the user interface <b>18</b> may present a left grip strength <b>1008</b> and a right grip strength <b>1010</b>. In some embodiments, the left grip strength and the right grip strength may be determined based on the left load measurement and the right load measurement, respectively. Numerical values representing the left grip strength <b>1008</b> and the right grip strength <b>1010</b> are displayed. Any suitable visual representation may be used to present the grip strengths (e.g., bar chart, line chart, etc.). The grip strengths may only be presented when the user is performing an exercise using handles.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The user interface <b>18</b> may also present a prompt <b>1012</b> that indicates the body position the user should be in to perform the exercise, as well as indicate which body portions will be targeted by performing the exercise. The user interface <b>18</b> may present other current and historical information related to the user performing the particular exercise. For example, the user interface <b>18</b> may present a visual representation <b>1014</b> of the user's maximum weight lifted, pressed, pulled, or otherwise exerted force for the day or a current exercise session. The user interface <b>18</b> may present a visual representation <b>1016</b> of the user's previous maximum weight lifted, pressed, pulled, or otherwise exerted force.

The exercises in these exercise plans help restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain, improve strength, improve flexibility, and, among other benefits, prevent or limit permanent physical disability in the patients. Patients who follow their exercise plans typically show signs of physical improvement and reduced pain at a faster the rate (i.e., a faster rate of recovery or rehabilitation).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In addition, after an injury or surgery, patients typically become less active than they once were, and they may experience muscle loss. As explained above, muscles that are not used often may reduce in muscle mass and become weaker. To increase the muscle mass and/or reduce the rate of muscle loss, people may conduct exercises according to an exercise plan.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Balancing and/or resistance exercise may cause muscle tissue to increase. For example, balancing on a balance board or pushing and pulling on a stationary object (e.g., pedals of an exercise cycle) with a certain amount of force may trigger the cells in the associated muscle to change and cause the muscle mass to increase.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The subject matter disclosed herein relates to a control system for an exercise machine, not only capable of enabling an individual, preferably an individual recovering from a fracture, an injury, or a surgery, to engage easily exercises according to an exercise plan, but capable of using predetermined thresholds or dynamically calculating them, such that the person using the exercise machine can be immediately informed through real-time visual and/or other sensorial feedback, that goals of the exercise plan have been met or exceeded, thus triggering osteogenesis for the subject bone (or bones), and/or that the muscular strength threshold has been exceeded, thereby triggering muscular hypertrophy for the subject muscle (or muscles). The control system may be used to improve compliance with an exercise plan, whereby the exercise plan includes one or more exercises.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">The control system may receive one or more measurements, such as load measurements, associated with forces exerted by both the left and right sides on left and right portions (e.g., pedals, base, or platform) of the exercise machine to enhance osteogenesis, bone growth, bone density improvement, stability, flexibility, range of motion, and/or muscle mass. The one or more measurements (e.g., a load measurement) may be a left measurement of a load or an increased resistance added to a left load cell on a left portion of the exercise machine (e.g., a left pedal or a left portion of the platform) and a right measurement of a load or an increased resistance added to a right load cell on a right portion of the exercise machine (e.g., a right pedal or a right portion of the platform). A user interface may be provided by the control system that presents visual representations of the separately measured left and right loads or resistances where the respective left and right load or resistances are added to the respective left and right load cells or sensors at the subject portions of the exercise machine. For example, the user interface may provide a video game that has an avatar representing the user (e.g, the patient in rehabilitation). The avatar may move in the video game and those moves may correlate with the moves of the patient. As the one or more measurements increase, the movement of the avatar may increase (e.g., if the video game is a car racing video game, as the patient increases the force exerted on the pedals, the speed of the avatar, in its car, will increase). Similarly, the control system may receive one or more measurements associated with speed, repetitions, balance, any other suitable measurement, or combination thereof. Such measurements can be used to move the avatar. The measurements can be received from sensors coupled to the exercise machine. For example, sensors can be coupled to the pedals of the exercise machine or to a base of the exercise machine.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">In some embodiments, initially, the control system may determine measurements in accordance with an exercise plan associated with each exercise of the video game. For example, there may be a first level of the video game that applies a first resistance to the pedals of the exercise machine (e.g., the cycle machine) and a second level of the video game that applies a second resistance to the pedals. Further, the control system may receive measurements associated with each exercise as a patient is using the exercise machine. The control system may generate a target threshold in accordance with an exercise plan associated with each exercise of the video game. For example, there may be a first threshold associated with the first level and a second threshold associated with the second level. The exercise may be complete when the one or more measurements are received and the one or more measurements exceed one or more target thresholds. For example, if the patient is playing the first level of the video game and one or more measurements exceed a first target threshold, the first level may end and the control system will select the level two for the patient to play. In some embodiments, the control system may determine an average measurement by accumulating raw measurements over a certain period of time (e.g., 5 seconds) and averaging the raw measurements to smooth the data (e.g., eliminates jumps or spikes in data) in an average measurement.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">The control system may compare the one or more measurements (e.g., raw measurements, or averaged measurements) to one or more target thresholds. In some embodiments, a single measurement may be compared to a single specific target threshold (e.g., a one-to-one relationship). In some embodiments, a single measurement may be compared to more than one specific target threshold (e.g., a one-to-many relationship). In some embodiments, more than one measurement may be compared to a single specific target threshold (e.g., a many-to-one relationship). In some embodiments, more than one measurement may be compared to more than one specific target threshold (e.g., a many-to-many relationship).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">The target thresholds may be an osteogenesis target threshold, a muscular strength target threshold, a balance threshold, a speed threshold, a range of motion threshold, a repetition threshold, any other suitable threshold, or combination thereof. In addition to the threshold explanations described above, the balance target threshold, the speed threshold, and/or the range of motion threshold may be determined based on a rehabilitation protocol pertaining to the user, an age of the user, a gender of the user, a sex of the user, a height of the user, a weight of the user, a bone density of the user, an injury of the user, a type of surgery of the user, a type of bone fracture of the user, etc. A rehabilitation protocol may refer to any illness, disease, fracture, surgery, or ailment experienced by the user and any treatment instructions provided by a caretaker for recovery and/or healing. The rehabilitation protocol may also include a condition of health where the goal is avoid a problem. Any of the target thresholds may be determined based on a historical performance of the user using the exercise machine (e.g., amount of pounds lifted for a particular exercise, amount of force applied associated with each body part, the range of motion for pedaling, the level of exertion, the level of pain, etc.) and/or other exercise machines, a fitness level (e.g., how active the user is) of the user, a diet of the user, a protocol for determining a muscular strength target, a range of motion target, etc.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">The control system may determine whether the one or more measurements exceed the one or more target thresholds. Responsive to determining that the one or more measurements exceed the one or more target thresholds, the control system may cause a user interface to present an indication that the one or more target thresholds have been met or exceeded and an exercise is complete. For example, the user has completed a level of the video game. Additionally, when the one or more target thresholds are met or exceeded, the control system may cause the user interface to present an indication that instructs the user to apply additional force (less than a safety limit) to attempt to set a personal maximum record or achievement (e.g., of a rate of speed, of a level of stability, a number of repetitions, of an amount of weight lifted, pressed, pulled, or otherwise exerted force) for that exercise. The control system may also determine that one or more target thresholds (e.g., a level of pain or an exersion level) are met or exceeded and end the exercise game being played. The control system may present the same game at an easier exercise game level or present a different game for the user to engage in different exercises to reduce the level of pain. In this way, the user can continue exercising rather than stopping the rehabilitation session due to pain. The video game may have one or more games, each of which have one or more exercises that target one or more muscles groups at one or more different levels of intensity.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Further, the user interface may present an indication when a measurement is approaching a target threshold for the user. In another example, when the measurement meets or exceeds the target threshold, the user interface may present an indication that the target threshold has been met or exceeded, respectively, and that the exercise is complete. The control system may provide visual and/or audio encouragement and/or coaching to the user during a video game. For example, as the user is nearing the target threshold, the control system may provide an audio of a human voice encouraging the user to maintain or increase speed on the cycling machine to earn an achievement or reach the end of the exercise game level. The control system may indicate if there are any remaining incomplete exercise game levels the video game as part of the exercise plan, that there is another game or another level (e.g., with a difference exercise and/or goal) to be completed by the user. If there are no remaining games or levels (i.e., exercises in the exercise plan) to complete, then the user interface may present an indication that all exercises in the exercise plan are complete and the user can rest. In addition, when the exercise plan is complete, the control system may generate a performance report that presents various information (e.g., charts and graphs of the right and left measurements received during each of the exercises, left and right maximum loads for the user received during each of the exercises, historical right and left measurements received in the past, comparison of the current right and left measurements with the historical right and left measurement, an amount of pounds lifted or pressed that is determined based on the measurements for each of the exercises, percent gained in measurements over time, achievements earned, goals reached, exercise game levels completed, rankings as compared to a video game history of playing, etc.).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Further, the one or more measurements may each be compared to a safety limit. For example, a left measurement and a right measurement may each be compared to the safety limit for the user. The safety limit may be determined for the user based on the user's disease protocol. There may be different safety limits for different portions of the user's body on the left and the right side, one extremity versus another extremity, a top portion of the user's body and a body portion of the user's body, etc., and for different exercises. For example, if someone underwent left knee surgery, the safety limit for a user for a left measurement for a cycling using a left leg may be different from the safety limit for a right measurement for that exercise and user. If the safety limit is exceeded, an indication may be presented on the user interface to instruct to reduce the amount of force or speed that the user is applying and/or to instruct the user to stop applying force because the safety limit has been exceeded.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Another benefit of the present disclosure is its ability to speed the healing of fractures in athletically robust individuals. Further, another benefit is the increase in muscle mass by using the exercise machine to trigger muscular hypertrophy. The control system may provide an automated interface that improves compliance with an exercise plan by using a real-time feedback loop to measure loads added during each of the exercises, (e.g. resistance applied to the pedals) compare the measurements to target thresholds and/or safety limits that are uniquely determined for the user using the exercise machine, and provide various indications based on the comparison. For example, the indications pertain to when the user should add more load, when the target thresholds are met or exceeded, when the safety limit is met or exceeded, when the exercise is complete, when the user should begin another game, when the user should begin another level of the exercise game, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Rehabilitation Exercises and their Benefits</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">The following exercises achieve rehabilitation results by exposing relevant parts of a user to exercises that build strength, increase flexibility, increase range of motion, increase balance, increase coordination, decrease pain, decrease the amount of time required for recovery, or any combination thereof.

The control system can then control the motor <b>1928</b> and/or the actuator to maintain the select rotational velocities of the wheel <b>1926</b>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some embodiment of the exercise machine <b>1900</b>, a switch, not illustrated, can be disposed on the first housing <b>1914</b> for activating the control system. In another embodiment, a button, not illustrated, may be disposed on the first housing <b>1914</b> for activating the control system. In yet another embodiment, a display <b>1932</b> of a user interface <b>1918</b>, such as a computer screen, iPad, or like device, can be coupled to the exercise machine <b>1900</b> to activate the control system. The switch, display <b>1932</b>, and/or button may be coupled to the exercise machine <b>1900</b> by alternative or other means. For example, the switch, display <b>1932</b>, and/or button could be coupled to the handle <b>1916</b>. It is further to be appreciated that alternative means could be used to activate the control system and the use of the switch, display <b>1932</b>, or the button, is not meant to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In another embodiment, one or more biometric sensors, not shown, may be coupled to the exercise machine <b>1900</b> for activating the control system. The biometric sensor could be for, inter alia, detection, recognition, validation and/or analysis of data relating to: facial characteristics; a fingerprint, hand, eye (iris), or voice signature; DNA; and/or handwriting. In yet another embodiment, the biometric sensor can comprise position sensors located on the user. In addition, it is contemplated that advancements of such biometric sensors may result in alternative sensors that could be incorporated in the exercise machine <b>1900</b>, i.e., biometric type sensors not currently on the market may be utilized. Further, the one or more biometric sensors may comprise a biometric system, which may be standalone or integrated.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">In one embodiment, adjustment of exercise based on artificial intelligence, exercise plan, and user feedback is disclosed. An exercise plan may include one or more exercise sessions. For example, an exercise plan may include a schedule of a certain number of exercises sessions for a certain time period (e.g., 3 exercise sessions each week for 4 weeks) that, if performed by the user, should result in a desired outcome (e.g., rehabilitation of a body part, strengthen a muscle, etc.). The exercise session may include one or more exercises for various sections (e.g., warm up, strength, flexibility, cycling, cool down, etc.) The exercise plan may be generated using artificial intelligence via one or more trained machine learning models as described herein. The exercise plan may include a plan of one or more exercise sessions including exercises for a patient for rehabilitating a body part. The exercise plan may include exercises for one or more muscle groups. The exercise plan may be generated by artificial intelligence and/or prescribed by a doctor, a physical therapist, or any other qualified clinician.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">For example, a machine learning model may be trained to select one or more exercises for an exercise session based on various inputs. The inputs may include the pain level of the user, the range of motion of the user, and/or characteristics of the user. These inputs may be used to determine an exercise level of the user. The machine learning model may receive the exercise level as input and select corresponding exercises from a data structure by matching the exercise level of the user to exercises having a tagged corresponding user exercise level. Various other techniques may be used to select the exercises for the exercise session.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">The machine learning models may be trained to control a virtual coach executing on a computing device associated with the exercise machine <b>100</b>. The virtual coach may speak via a speaker of the computing device, may be a virtual avatar displayed on the user interface <b>18</b> of the computing device <b>12</b>, may cause one or more messages, emails, text, notifications, prompts, etc. to be presented on the user interface <b>18</b>. The virtual coach may perform actions based on various information, such as progress of the user performing an exercise, the exercise plan details, user feedback, and the like. For example, the virtual coach may provide encouragement to the user based on the progress of the user during an exercise. The virtual coach may provide incentives, rewards, and/or certificates to the user as the user completes exercises. The virtual coach may have a particular persona that is selected for a particular user. For example, some users may respond better and perform exercises completely in response to a nice and encouraging persona for the virtual coach, while other users may respond better to a more demanding and strict (e.g., drill sergeant) persona.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">By tailoring the exercise plan for the specific user and dynamically adjusting it using artificial intelligence, compliance with the exercise plan may be enhanced. Further, the user may achieve their desired goal faster by using the generated exercise plan because it is based on their progress and feedback (e.g., pain level, exercise difficulty level). By achieving the desired outcome faster, computing resources (e.g., processing, memory, network, etc.) may be reduced because the exercise machine <b>100</b>, the computing device <b>12</b>, and/or the cloud-based computing system <b>16</b> may not have to continuously update the exercise plan.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Further, the virtual coach may provide a companion type of feel for the user, which may further cause the user to comply with the exercise plan more efficiently and completely, thereby achieving their desired outcome faster. The virtual coach may improve the user experience of using the computing device <b>12</b> and/or the exercise machine <b>100</b> because the persona may be selected specifically for the particular user. In some instances, the user may form a bond with the persona of the virtual coach if the persona matches a friend in real life, family member, a significant other, or the like, and the bond may cause the user to feel a desire to want to listen to the virtual coach and/or complete the exercise plan such that they don't let the virtual coach down. Such a situation may also save computing resources because the exercise plan may not have to be adjusted and lengthened by adding additional exercise sessions.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">As a result, various technical benefits may be achieved by the disclosed embodiments, as described above. Further, the user experience of using the exercise machine <b>100</b>, the computing device <b>12</b>, or both may be improved based on the disclosed techniques due to exercising with the virtual coach, the incentives, the rewards, the certificates, and the like.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The processing device may be configured to execute the instructions to receive user input data. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the user interface <b>2100</b> may display a screen <b>2102</b> requesting a user to provide a pain level. The user can select the level of pain (e.g., no pain, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) before an exercise begins. The level of pain may be used to determine an exercise level of the user. Once the level of pain is selected, a testing phase may be initiated where a user performs an exercise to determine their range of motion, for example. The level of pain and the range of motion may be used to determine the exercise level of the user. The user interface <b>2100</b> may provide visual and/or audio prompts for the user. The user may provide the user interface <b>2100</b> with the user input by touching the user interface <b>2100</b>, speaking to the user interface <b>2100</b>, or any other suitable input. The user interface <b>2100</b> may request that a user enter other user input, such as an exertion level, a difficulty of an exercise, or the like. Further, a virtual coach may read the question to the user by saying (via a speaker) &#x201c;What is your knee pain level today? Please say it out loud.&#x201d; The processing device may be configured to execute the virtual coach to provide coaching and instructions to a user on how to use the exercise machines <b>100</b>, an exercise, or any other suitable information. The instructions and/or coaching may be a prerecorded or dynamic virtual coach (e.g., a trainer or a physical therapist) and provide commands, instructions, and/or tips via audio and/or video. For example, the virtual coach may provide tips on posture and form while performing an exercise or using the exercise machine. The virtual coach may provide motivational content, such as words of encouragement to the user. The virtual coach may be provided randomly during the video game and/or it may be based on input and/or data from the user and/or sensors. The virtual coach may be data-driven. The processing device can receive user input data, sensor data, tracker data, historical data, and/or any other suitable information to obtain information, such as the difficulty level of the exercise, whether the user likes the persona of the virtual coach, and provide audio and/or visual coaching to the user.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates an example user interface <b>2200</b> presenting a pedal setting for a session as determined by a machine learning model.

Such selection may cause the machine learning model <b>60</b> to alter the exercise, the exercise session, or both. For example, the cloud-based computing system <b>16</b> may increase or decrease the intensity of the exercise by modifying a parameter (e.g., resistance, speed, etc.) of the exercise machine <b>100</b>. Further, if the options for too easy or too hard are chosen more than a threshold number of times, the machine learning model <b>60</b> may remove the exercise from the exercise session, add another exercise to the exercise session, switch to a different exercise, or the like.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref> illustrates an example method <b>2700</b> for generating, using a machine learning model, an exercise session for a user and causing a virtual coach to provide instructions pertaining to the exercise session. The operations can be used to improve compliance with an exercise plan. The method <b>2700</b> may be performed by processing logic that may include hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), firmware, software, or a combination of them. The method <b>2700</b> and/or each of their individual functions, subroutines, or operations may be performed by one or more processing devices of a control system (e.g., cloud-based computing system <b>16</b>, computing device <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) implementing the method <b>2700</b>. The method <b>2700</b> may be implemented as computer instructions that are executable by a processing device of the control system (e.g., a computer-readable medium may be used to store instructions that, when executed, cause a processor perform the following steps or processes of the method <b>2700</b>). In certain implementations, the method <b>2700</b> may be performed by a single processing thread. Alternatively, the method <b>2700</b> may be performed by two or more processing threads, each thread implementing one or more individual functions, routines, subroutines, or operations of the methods.

The set of inputs may include an indication of a level of pain of the user, a range of motion of a body part of the user, a set of characteristics of the user, or some combination thereof. The indication of the level of pain of the user may be entered by the user using any suitable peripheral device (e.g., microphone, keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, etc.) at a particular user interface <b>18</b> displayed on a computing device <b>12</b>. The range of motion of the body part of the user may be determined by the processing device by the user performing a baseline exercise for a certain amount of time. The baseline exercise may include setting a pedal at an initial position and having the user cycle at that position for a period of time. If the user does not experience any pain after the period of time, the pedal may be moved to a second position and the user may cycle for the period of time again. If the user experiences pain, then the range of motion of the user may be determined based on the previous position of the pedal when the user was able to cycle without pain. As may be appreciated, if the user does not experience pain, the position of the pedal may continue to change until the user experiences pain and the ROM of the user may be determined based on the prior position where the user did not experience pain. The characteristics of the user may include an age of the user, a height of the user, a weight of the user, a gender of the user, a condition that caused the pain in the body part, one or more procedures perform on the user, a goal of the user, whether the user is in a pre-procedure stage or a post-procedure stage, or some combination thereof.

The virtual coach may be driven by artificial intelligence via one or more trained machine learning models <b>60</b>. For example, the trained machine learning models may receive various inputs, such as the exercise session for the user, the exercise being performed, instructions pertaining to the exercise being performed, completion of the exercise being performed, progress of the exercise being performed, and may be trained to provide certain outputs based on the inputs. The virtual coach may output audible noise (e.g., speech) that pertain to the various inputs. For example, the virtual coach may say, via a speaker of the computing device <b>12</b>, encouraging words while a user is performing an exercise, congratulatory words when the user completes an exercise, instructions when the user is about to start another exercise, and the like. The virtual coach may have a persona (e.g., a cheerleader type of persona, a drill sergeant type of persona) that is selected based on progress of the user, feedback of the user, or both, as described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0230">In some embodiments, the processing device may receive, from the user while the user is performing an exercise of the one or more exercises in the exercise session, feedback pertaining to the exercise.

For example, the user may use a display screen or microphone of the computing device <b>12</b> to enter or say the exercise is &#x201c;too easy&#x201d; or &#x201c;too hard&#x201d;. Responsive to receiving the feedback, the processing device may cause an intensity of the exercise to increase or decrease. For example, if the user says &#x201c;too easy&#x201d; the intensity of the exercise may be increased. If the user says &#x201c;too hard&#x201d;, the intensity of the exercise may be decreased. Other dimensions, parameters, characteristics, etc. of the exercise or exercise session may be changed based on whether the feedback is too easy or too hard. For example, the other dimensions, parameters, characteristics, etc. may include a number of sets, a number of repetitions, a hold time, a rest time, and the like. When one of the dimensions, parameters, characteristics, etc. changes, the virtual coach may provide an indication of the change. For example, the virtual coach may say, via a speaker of the computing device <b>12</b>, &#x201c;The intensity for this exercise has increased&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">In some embodiments, the processing device may track how many times the user has provided the feedback for a particular exercise in an exercise session or across every exercise session in an exercise plan for the user.

Further, the processing device may remove the exercise for which the feedback was received more than the threshold number of times from subsequent exercise sessions and replace it with another exercise. The processing device may cause the virtual coach to provide an indication via the computing device <b>12</b> (e.g., voice emitted through the speaker, graphic on the user interface <b>18</b>, text on the user interface <b>18</b>, or the like) of the change to the exercise.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">In some embodiments, the processing device may monitor the progress of the user while the user uses the exercise machine to perform the one or more exercises. The progress may include an amount of time the user performs the one or more exercises, the range of motion of the user while the user performs the one or more exercises, the level of pain of the user while the user performs the one or more exercises, whether the user completes the one or more exercises, an indication of the user of a level of difficulty of the one or more exercises, or some combination. The progress may be determined based on measurement data received from any sensor associated with the exercise machine <b>100</b>, any user feedback received by the computing device <b>12</b>, and the like. The user may use any suitable peripheral to input the level of difficulty (e.g., too hard or too easy) while the user performs the exercises.

Providing incentives, rewards, or both may encourage the user to continue to perform exercises and comply with the exercise session, which in turn, may decrease the amount of time it takes for the user to achieve their goal. Reducing the amount of time it takes for the user to achieve their goal may include technical benefits because if the user achieves their goal faster, the computing device <b>12</b>, exercise machine <b>100</b>, and/or the cloud-based computing system <b>16</b> may save computing resources (e.g., processing, memory, network) by not having to execute as long to guide the use through the exercise plan.

For example, at the initiation of the exercise, the audio segment may provide instructions to the user on the details of the exercise (e.g., 2 reps, 30 seconds, etc.). Based on the progress of the user, the audio segment may say &#x201c;pedal faster&#x201d; if the user is not pedaling fast enough, &#x201c;good job&#x201d; if the user is satisfying the criteria for the exercise, &#x201c;almost finished&#x201d; if the user is almost finished with the exercise, or the like. The audio segments may be dynamically determined, in real-time or near real-time, by the machine learning model <b>60</b> based on the inputs described above.

Various operations of the method <b>4200</b> may be performed by one or more of the cloud-based computing system <b>16</b>, the computing device <b>12</b>, and/or the computing device <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0279">The method <b>4200</b> may enable generating an improved exercise plan for a user to perform using at least an exercise machine <b>100</b>. At <b>4202</b>, the processing device may receive data pertaining to the user. The data pertaining to the user may include at least one selection of a physical activity goal the user desires to achieve. In some embodiments, the user may select more than one physical activity goal to achieve. The physical activity goals may include any activity that includes physical motion of a portion of the user's body. For example, the physical activity goals may include ameliorating knee pain, traversing stairs, gardening, performing yardwork, playing, walking, running, meditating, learning faster, improving concentration, improving focus, increasing response time to stimuli, improving relationships, improving sex drive, changing a state of mind, improving cardiovascular performance, improving heart rate, improving blood pressure, sitting without pain, standing without pain, feeling energized, performing more advanced exercises, performing more exercises, carrying groceries, performing house chores, losing weight, or some combination thereof. In some embodiments, the user may use a user interface including one or more graphical elements to select the physical activity goal via the computing device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0280">In some embodiments, the processing device may execute a machine learning model <b>60</b> trained to generate the exercise plan using an energy score. An energy score may refer to an amount of energy it takes to achieve the physical activity goal. The energy score may be based on a metabolic indicator associated with performing each exercise. The energy score may be an accumulation of at least all the metabolic indicators for the exercises included in the exercise plan. An energy consumption metric may be associated with each exercise, and the energy consumption metric may be determined using the metabolic indicator for an exercise, user fitness test results, user-reported pain levels, an indication of a pain level the user is in, heartrate, step count, blood pressure, perspiration, blood oxygen levels, body temperature, or some combination thereof. The energy score may indicate that by performing the exercises included in the exercise plan, the user will have enough energy to be able to achieve the physical activity goal. To determine whether the user exerted enough energy for that particular exercise, progress toward the energy score may be tracked at each exercise by calculating the energy consumption metric. One or more graphical elements (e.g., charts, tables, etc.) may be used to dynamically visualize, by depicting respective energy consumption metrics over a time series, the progress the user is making toward the energy score.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0281">Each of the physical activity goals may include one or more levels of attainment to achieve. As described herein, the one or more levels of attainment may refer to range of motion, strength, endurance, balance, intelligence, neurological responsiveness, emotional well-being, cardiovascular well-being, and/or mobility. The levels of attainment may be associated with each physical activity goal. For example, a gardening physical activity goal may cause an exercise plan to be generated that includes exercises that improve the levels of attainment involving range of motion (e.g., kneeling down and bending over to garden) and endurance (e.g., energy consumed by gardening), more than the level of attainment of mobility (e.g., since the user is typically not moving around very much while planting flowers or the like). The levels of attainment may be quantified by, measured by, or associated with measurements (e.g., range of motion extension and/or flexion angles, exerted force measurements, amount of weight lifted, pressed, or curled, etc.), achievements (e.g., number of sets completed, number of repetitions completed, number of exercise sessions completed, weight lost, calories consumed, steps walked, etc.), and the like. The measurements may be obtained via one or more sensors associate with the exercise machine <b>100</b>, the user, or the environment in which the user uses the exercise machine <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the sensor may be a wearable device that the user wears while using and while not using the exercise machine <b>100</b>. For example, a step counting wearable may be worn by the user while not engaged in an active exercise session (e.g., while walking around a grocery store, etc.).</p><p id="p-0284" num="0282">The data obtained from the sensors may enable monitoring the user's comprehensive lifestyle to enable predicting when the user will achieve the physical activity goal accurately and to provide recommendations pertaining to the user's health. In some embodiments, data from each user of the application <b>17</b>, the exercise machine <b>100</b>, or both, may be monitored and stored to enable training the machine learning models <b>60</b> to perform one or more functions. For example, the machine learning models <b>60</b> may be generated using training data that enables the machine learning models <b>60</b> to receive input data (e.g., characteristic of the user, performance measurement, pain level of the user, etc.) pertaining to the users and/or the selected physical activity goal and to predict a length of time it will take the user to achieve the physical activity goal if they comply with a particular exercise plan. The machine learning models <b>60</b> may identify patterns between the data pertaining to the user and other data pertaining to other users, and may determine that the other users, by following the recommended exercise plan, achieved the same physical activity goals in the length of time. In some embodiments, the processing device may transmit the amount of time it will take the user to achieve the physical activity goal to the computing device <b>12</b> for presentation. In some embodiments, the machine learning models <b>60</b> may be generated and trained to receive the data pertaining to the user and determine one or more comorbidities of the user (e.g., the user is at risk for diabetes because they are overweight and depressed, etc.). The machine learning models <b>60</b> may be trained to identify patterns between the user and other users that have similar data and may determine the similarly situated users have the comorbidities.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0283">At <b>4204</b>, the processing device may generate, by executing the artificial intelligence engine <b>65</b>, the improved exercise plan. The artificial intelligence engine <b>65</b> may generate the machine learning models <b>60</b> trained to perform the generating of the improved exercise plan using the data source. The improved exercise plan may include at least one set of exercises to be performed by the user to achieve at least one of the one or more levels of attainment associated with the physical activity goal. The artificial intelligence engine <b>65</b> may use at least one data source <b>67</b> configured to include information pertaining to one or more information pertaining to one or more exercises and at least one of the one or more levels of attainment associated with the physical activity goal.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0284">In some embodiments, the data source may include a set of rankings and each ranking of the set of rankings may pertain to a priority level for each of the one or more levels of attainment pertaining to achieving the physical activity goal. The set of exercises selected may be arranged in the improved exercise plan based on the set of rankings. For example, for a physical activity goal of gardening, the levels of attainment of range of motion and endurance may be ranked higher than the level of attainment of mobility, and as a result, exercises that target the portion(s) of the body associated with achieving range of motion and endurance may be prioritized in the exercise plan. Prioritizing those exercises may refer to including more exercises that are associated with the higher ranking levels of attainment, including more repetitions and/or sets for those exercises, including longer durations for performing the exercises, and the like. In some embodiments, (i) a first portion of the set of exercises associated with a level of attainment having a certain ranking may be included in a set of initial exercises to perform in the improved exercise plan, and (ii) a second portion of the set of exercises associated with the level of attainment having another ranking may be included as a set of last exercises to perform in the improved exercise plan.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0285">The data source <b>67</b> may include a first association between the physical activity goal and the one or more levels of attainment pertaining to achieving the physical activity goal, a second association between the one or more levels of attainment and one or more body portions of a human being, and a third association between the one or more body portions and one or more exercises that target the one or more body portions. The processing device may select the at least one set of exercises based on the first association, the second association, and the third association in order to provide an exercise plan that targets the body portions associated with the levels of attainment for the physical activity goal. In some embodiments, the data source <b>67</b> may include exercises that are curated by one or more health professionals, such as a trainer, a medical doctor, a physical therapist, a surgeon, or the like. Further, the associations between the levels of attainment, exercises, body portions, and the like may be curated, filtered, reviewed, revised, and the like by the health professionals.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0286">In some embodiments, to generate the improved exercise plan, the processing device may execute the one or more machine learning models <b>60</b> trained to use an onboarding protocol, a fitness level of the user. The onboarding protocol may include exercises with tiered difficulty levels. The onboarding protocol may advance a difficulty level for a subsequent exercise in the exercises when the user completes an exercise in the exercises. The fitness level of the user may be determined based on a completion state (e.g., percentage, amount completed, performance measurement, user-report difficulty level, user-reported pain level, etc.) of a last exercise performed by the user. The machine learning models <b>60</b> may select a difficulty level for each exercise in the improved exercise plan by associating the difficulty level for each exercise with the fitness level of the user. This onboarding protocol may be referred to as a baseline fitness test. One purpose of the onboarding protocol may be to match user's having particular fitness levels with exercises that have difficulty levels the user should be able to perform, and to optimize compliance and enhance an amount of time it takes to achieve the physical activity goal.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0287">At <b>4206</b>, the processing device may transmit the improved exercise plan to a computing device. For example, the improved exercise plan may be transmitted to computing device <b>12</b> and may be presented by the user interface <b>18</b> of the application <b>17</b>. In some embodiments, the processing device may execute the artificial intelligence engine <b>65</b> and/or machine learning models <b>60</b> to transmit a signal to the exercise machine <b>100</b>. In response to the exercise machine <b>10</b> receiving the signal, a portion of the exercise machine <b>100</b> may be adjusted. The adjustment may be based on an attribute of an operating parameter specified in the improved exercise plan. For example, an attribute of a speed operating parameter may indicate a particular pedaling exercise should be performed at 5 miles per hour. When the exercise machine <b>100</b> receives the signal including a control instruction specifying the speed at which a motor of the exercise machine <b>100</b> should operate, a processing device of the exercise machine <b>100</b> may use the attribute of the operating parameter to control the motor to operate at 5 miles per hour. There may be numerous attributes and numerous operating parameters specified in the improved exercise plan. For example, each exercise selected may be associated with various attributes for various operating parameters. The exercises and their attributes of operating parameters may be selected in order to improve a rate at which the user achieves the physical activity goal, improve compliance, ameliorate boredom, enhance enjoyment, and the like. Based on characteristics of the user, performance measurements of the user, user-reported difficulty levels of exercises, and/or user-reported pain levels, the exercises and attributes of operating parameters may change dynamically as a user performs the exercise plan.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0288">In some embodiments, the processing device prompts, via the computing device <b>12</b>, the user for feedback pertaining to one or more levels of enjoyment while performing the improved exercise plan. The set of exercises in the improved exercise plan are arranged in a performance order to ameliorate boredom based on the one or more levels of enjoyment. For example, a machine learning model <b>60</b> may be trained to match patterns between the user and other users that performed exercise plans, and to determine the other similar matched users indicated they enjoyed a particular order of exercises in an exercise plan or did not enjoy the particular order. The machine learning model <b>60</b> may be trained to select the exercises and/or an order of the exercises for a user based on whether the user has experienced they enjoy the exercise and/or order or other users indicated they enjoyed the exercise and/or order. In some embodiments, a healthcare professional (e.g., physical therapist, etc.) may use empirical evidence and/or data to select the exercises and/or performance order to maximize enjoyment, minimize boredom, and/or maximize compliance. In some embodiments, the machine learning models <b>60</b> may be trained to solve optimization (e.g., maximization, minimization, etc.) problems to generate an improved exercise plan.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0289">In some embodiments, the processing device may determine a fitness level of a user. The fitness level of the user may be determined by one or more machine learning models <b>60</b> using data pertaining to the user. The data may include characteristics of the user, such as height, weight, age, medical history, etc., performance measurements (e.g., range of motion, speed, force, exercise duration, etc.), and indications of pain levels provided by the user. The fitness level of the user may include a value or quantification using any suitable scale. For example, a scale of 1 to 5 may be used to rate the fitness level of the user. A 1 may indicate the user is a beginner or has a lowest fitness level and a 5 may indicate the user is an elite athlete and has a highest fitness level.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0290">In some embodiments, the processing device may cause presentation of a user interface on the computing device <b>12</b>, and the user interface may present multimedia of a coaching character configured to provide instructions on how to perform an exercise of the improved exercise plan. Based on the determined fitness level of the user, the processing device may modify the multimedia (e.g., video, and/or audio) of a coaching character (e.g., a human, a virtual representation of a human, an animated character, an augmented reality character, a virtual reality character, etc.) performing an exercise in the improved exercise plan. The modifying of the multimedia may include slowing down playback of the video if the user has a low fitness level (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) or speeding up playback of the video if the user has a high fitness level (e.g., 3, 4, 5, etc.). The multimedia may be selected from the data source <b>67</b>. The data source <b>67</b> may store numerous multimedia files and each multimedia file may correspond with a particular exercise (e.g., a video of a coaching character performing a seated bar curl). The processing device may modify the multimedia playback according to the user's fitness level such that the user has an engaging, productive, enjoyable, and/or appropriate exercise session.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0291">In some embodiments, based on one or more factors, the processing device may pair an audio clip and a video clip to generate a paired audio and video clip. The one or more factors may include a fitness level of the user, types of exercises included in the improved exercise plan, one or more characteristics of the user (e.g., height, weight, age, gender, medical history, medical procedures, etc.), one or more performance measurements (e.g., range of motion, force, speed, distance, etc.), a sensor measurement, feedback from the user pertaining to a difficulty of an exercise, or some combination thereof. While the user performs the improved exercise plan, the processing device may cause playback of the paired audio and video clip. For example, if the user indicates that an exercise is too hard using the user interface, then the processing device may generate a paired audio and video clip that provides an encouraging statement (e.g., &#x201c;Almost done!&#x201d;, &#x201c;You got this&#x201d;, etc.) and/or slows down playback speed of the coaching character performing the exercise in the video. Such a technical solution may also provide engaging, productive, enjoyable, and/or appropriate exercise sessions for the user. The user's experience using the computing device and/or exercise machine <b>100</b> may be enhanced, thereby improving technology.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0292">In some embodiments, the processing device may transmit a notification for presentation on the computing device <b>12</b>. The notification may include an indication that an exercise performed by the user also helps to achieve a second physical activity goal. For example, the user may be performing a leg press exercise using the exercise machine <b>100</b>, and the leg press exercise may have been selected because it improves a strength level of attainment; however, the leg press exercise may also improve mobility, and thus, the notification may be presented on the computing device <b>12</b> to indicate the same. Further, the notification can indicate that improving mobility may help the user achieve a physical activity goal of jogging a mile, playing with their grandchildren, or any suitable physical goal associated with the mobility level of attainment.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0293">In some embodiments, while the user performs the exercise plan using the exercise machine <b>100</b>, the processing device may monitor one or more characteristics of the user, performance measurements of the user, user-reported pain feedback, and the like. The processing device may determine whether an exercise in the set of exercises results in a desired outcome. The processing device may determine an exercise is successful if the user exceeds a performance measurement threshold, completes the exercise to a certain threshold percentage, reports they are not experiencing pain, or the like. The artificial intelligence engine <b>65</b> may generate one or more machine learning models <b>60</b> that are trained to generate improved exercise plans based on whether the exercise in the set of exercises results in the desired outcome. Accordingly, the processing device may implement a feedback look to iteratively improve the generated exercise plans according to whether they are providing desired results.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0294"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref> illustrates an example method <b>4300</b> for selecting a multimedia clip for a user based on data pertaining to the user.
