Such casks insert gas filled casks are referred to as a &#x201c;dry cask.&#x201d; Multiple fuel rods are bundled together in a support structure referred to as a fuel assembly which are well known in the art without undue elaboration here. The fuel assemblies are liftable structures typically having a rectangular cuboid shape for U.S. reactors which are configured for insertion into the reactor as self-supporting units.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A gas filled dry cask (&#x201c;dry cask&#x201d;) holding multiple such fuel assembly units, however, is not perfect from the standpoint of controlling the temperature of the heat-emitting nuclear waste fuel because the heat rejection rate from such a vessel is inhibited by the low thermal conductivity of the gaseous media. This exposes the zirconia fuel rod tubes (cladding) to oxidation and damage, thereby adversely affecting the structural integrity of the containment provided by the tubes for the fissionable nuclear fuel material (e.g. uranium ceramic pellets) packed inside the fuel rods.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improvements in cask storage systems for radioactive nuclear waste is desired.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application discloses a wet cask system for storing and transporting radioactive nuclear waste such as without limitation spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The system includes an unventilated and hermetically sealed cask containing a volume or inventory of water in which the SNF (e.g. fuel assemblies) is submerged. In one embodiment, the water may be borated for additional radiation shielding. The body of the cask comprises radiation shielding to block and attenuate gamma and neutron radiation emitted by the SNF assemblies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wet cask system preferably further includes a pressure control sub-system for limiting internal pressure in the cask during a high pressure excursion conditions. In various embodiments, the pressure control sub-system comprises one or more evacuated internal pressure control devices which may be pressure surge capacitors in one embodiment. These capacitors are configured for insertion into the cask cavity occupied by the SNF, and operable to control and mitigate high pressure surge events experienced internally within the wet cask such as those occurring under various postulated accidents and abnormal operating conditions previously described herein. Advantageously, this protects the structural integrity of the cask from such high pressurize excursions which may be caused by external factors (such as fire or degradation of the heat rejection process from the external surface of the cask) or a massive liberation of the gases encapsulated in the fuel rods due to degradation of this metal zirconia cladding described above.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each pressure surge capacitor may be a fully welded and hermetically sealed vessel (no credible path for leakage in or out) in one embodiment comprising at least one rupture disk which seals an internal vacuum chamber inside the capacitor. Each rupture disk is designed and constructed to burst at a predesigned/predetermined pressure level or condition occurring inside the cask cavity external to the pressure surge capacitor. This allows the excess cask pressure occurring during a high pressure excursion to bleed into capacitor, thereby returning the pressure inside the cask to acceptable levels. The vacuum cavity inside each pressure surge capacitor is evacuated to sub-atmospheric (i.e. negative pressure) conditions to the greatest extend practicable. The pressure surge capacitors may have an elongated tubular configuration in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The wet cask with hermetically sealable cavity may be used for various applications associated with operation of a nuclear reactor such as in a nuclear power generation facility. For example, in one non-limiting application, the wet cask may be used to transfer spent nuclear fuel assemblies in a continuously submerged stated in the cask between spent fuel pools. The fuel assemblies may be loaded into the wet cask in a first pool underwater, the cask may be lifted out of the first pool and transported to and positioned in a second pool. Radiation blocking is achieved by maintaining the fuel assemblies in the water-impounded cask even during transport.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Although the cavity of the cask may be configured and have appurtenances designed to hold SNF assemblies in some embodiments, any type or form of high level radioactive nuclear waste or irradiated materials may be stored in a submerged stated in the inventory of water held by the cask. Such high level radioactive waste materials may be collectively referred to as &#x201c;radioactive nuclear waste.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, a storage system for radioactive nuclear waste comprises: a longitudinal axis; a cask comprising a hermetically sealable internal cavity configured to hold an inventory of water sufficient to submerge the nuclear waste therein; and a pressure surge capacitor disposed in the cask, the pressure surge capacitor comprising a vacuum cavity evacuated to sub-atmospheric conditions; wherein the pressure surge capacitor is configured to suppress a pressure surge in the internal cavity of the cask.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, a cask with overpressurization protection for storing nuclear waste fuel comprises: a longitudinal axis; a cask body comprising a removable lid assembly, a base, and a circumferential wall including radiation shielding, the cask body forming a hermetically sealed internal cavity configured for holding spent nuclear fuel submerged in an inventory of water; a pressure surge capacitor disposed in the cask, the pressure surge capacitor comprising a vacuum cavity evacuated to sub-atmospheric conditions; and the pressure surge capacitor further comprising at least one rupture disk constructed to burst at a predetermined pressure level inside the cask associated with a cask overpressurization condition; wherein the rupture disk when burst allows a portion of the water to fill the vacuum chamber to reduce pressure inside the cask.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, a method for controlling pressure in a wet nuclear waste storage system comprises: providing a cask comprising a sealable internal cavity configured for storing nuclear waste; positioning a pressure surge capacitor in the cask, the pressure surge capacitor comprising a vacuum cavity evacuated to sub-atmospheric conditions and in fluid communication with the internal cavity; filling the cask with water; submerging the nuclear waste in the water; and sealing a lid assembly to the cask to hermetically seal the internal cavity; wherein the pressure surge capacitor is configured to suppress a pressure surge in the internal cavity of the cask. The method may further comprise after the sealing step, steps of: increasing the pressure inside the cask to exceed a predetermined burst pressure of a rupture disk of the pressure surge capacitor; bursting the rupture disk; and admitting a portion of the water into the pressure surge capacitor which reduces the pressure inside the cask.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements are labeled similarly and in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is top perspective view of a pressure vessel in the form of an unventilated hermetically sealable wet cask for storing and transporting radioactive nuclear waste such as SNF according to the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view thereof;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top exploded perspective view thereof;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bottom exploded perspective view thereof;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a first side view thereof;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a second side view thereof;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view thereof;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a bottom view thereof;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a transverse cross sectional view taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> through the lid assembly of the cask;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of a spend nuclear fuel (SNF) assembly;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a longitudinal cross sectional view of the cask;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an enlarged detail from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pressure surge capacitor of the cask;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a side view thereof;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an end view thereof;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a side cross sectional view thereof;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an exploded end perspective view thereof;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is an enlarged detail of the cask taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a transverse cross sectional view of the cask taken from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a cross-sectional perspective view of the cask showing the pressure surge capacitor in a first mounting location in the cask;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a transverse cross-sectional of the cask showing the pressure surge capacitor in a second mounting location in the cask; and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a transverse cross-sectional of the upper end of the cask showing the pressure surge capacitor in a third mounting location in the cask.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">All drawings are schematic and not necessarily to scale.

The wet cask system advantageously overcomes the shortcomings of insert gas &#x201c;dry casks&#x201d; previously described herein. The relatively high conductivity of water keeps the fuel much cooler than does the inert gas medium in the dry cask; an advantage that is highly desirable from the standpoint of maintaining a low pressure inside the nuclear fuel rods. The fuel rods are elongated and thin-walled zirconium metal tubes (also called fuel cladding) containing the fuel pellets of fissionable material (e.g. uranium ceramic pellets) and an inert fill gas mixed with the radioactive gases in the tubes produced in the reactor core. The high-pressure attendant to high temperature (pursuant to the classical Gas law) causes a high membrane stress in the fuel cladding which is known to cause cladding's failure and release of its gaseous contents into the cask's fuel storage cavity. Preventing these harmful gases from escaping into the environment is a key mission of a cask. The cask is therefore designed to withstand a rise in its internal pressure caused by failure of the fuel cladding. Assuming that a significant quantity of gas release could occur during a cask's operation, designing its pressure retention capability with ample structural margin is accordingly a mandatory requirement in virtually all regulatory jurisdictions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a wet cask in which the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) assemblies are immersed in water, the small free volume above the water and SNF (e.g. headspace) is occupied by water vapor. In case of a regulatory postulated fire event, heating the captive volume of water in the wet cask can raise the vapor pressure in the headspace or an accident leading to massive fuel rod failures inside the cask can release large quantities of the fuel rod gas into the cask cavity. Generation of hydrogen and oxygen by radiolysis of water is another source of pressure build up, although this problem is largely overcome by the use of passively acting hydrogen recombiners or hydrogen &#x201c;getters&#x201d; placed inside the cask. The vulnerability of the wet cask to rapid pressure rise is further aggravated by the fact that, at high pressures, even a small increase in the temperature causes a large bump in the saturation pressure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To make wet casks safe and viable for storage/transport of high heat load used or spent nuclear waste fuel, a pressure control sub-system is disclosed herein to protect the cask from a high internal pressure surge under the foregoing accident conditions.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With continuing reference in general to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>24</b></figref>, the present wet cask system with integrated pressure control sub-system generally includes a leak-tight sealable cask <b>100</b> and at least one pressure surge capacitor <b>200</b> operable to absorb a high pressure excursion occurring internally within the cask. There are no provisions for circulating ambient cooling air through cask <b>100</b>, which is distinguishable from vertical ventilated type overpacks or casks well known in the industry.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Cask <b>100</b> may be a hermetically sealed, leak-tight pressure vessel comprising a vertically elongated metallic cylindrical body <b>101</b> defining a vertical longitudinal axis LA passing through the vertical centerline and geometric center of the body. The cask body generally includes (in progression from top to bottom) lid assembly <b>110</b>, annular top flange <b>103</b>, cylindrical circumferential wall <b>102</b>, and circular base <b>104</b> at bottom. Circumferential wall <b>102</b> defines a circumferentially-extending sidewall extending vertically between top flange <b>103</b> and base <b>104</b>. The top and bottom ends of wall <b>102</b> may be fixedly coupled to the top flange and bottom base via welded connections such as one or more circumferentially continuous seal welds for each to permanently join the components together. Top flange <b>103</b> and base <b>104</b> may be forged steel structures in one embodiment for added mechanical strength in one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the external surface of the cask circumferential wall <b>102</b> may optionally comprise a plurality of annular heat transfer fins <b>118</b> extending circumferentially around the cask <b>100</b>. The fins may be arranged in longitudinally spaced apart manner on the cask and extend in a vertical array between top flange <b>103</b> and bottom base <b>104</b> as shown. Since the sealed cask is not cooled by introducing and flowing ambient cooling air internally through the cask, the fins help remove heat emitted by the decaying fuel in the SNF assemblies in the cask. In other embodiments, the fins may be omitted.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cask body <b>101</b> defines an internal cavity <b>105</b> which extends longitudinally for a full height of the cask from base <b>104</b> at bottom to the top end of circumferential wall <b>102</b>.

The fuel assemblies may be insertably contained in a fuel basket <b>115</b> is disposed in cavity <b>105</b> and seated on the bottom base <b>104</b>. This design obviates the need for a typical unshielded fuel canister used with some casks. The present cask <b>100</b> may instead be completely submerged directly into the spent fuel pool associated with the reactor for loading individual fuel assemblies into the basket while the assemblies remain immersed under water for radiation containment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The fuel basket <b>115</b> is a honeycomb prismatic structure comprising an array of vertically-extending openings forming a plurality of vertical longitudinally-extending fuel assembly storage cells <b>116</b>.

The cells <b>116</b> may each have generally square cross-sectional shape as shown which is complementary configured to the cross sectional shape of the fuel assembly. Such fuel assemblies and the foregoing fuel basket structure are well known in the industry. The fuel basket may be formed in various embodiments by a plurality of interlocked and orthogonally arranged slotted plates built up to a selected height in vertically stacked tiers of plates. Examples of slotted plate basket constructions are disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/115,005, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other constructions of fuel baskets such as multiple laterally adjacent vertically extending tubes or other structures to the canister baseplate may be used and others used in the art may be used. In addition, the fuel assembly cells <b>116</b> in some constructions may have a hexagonal cross-sectional shape to accommodate hexagonal fuel assemblies commonly used in Russia. The fuel basket construction however is not limiting of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the polygonal shaped structure of the complete fuel basket <b>115</b> structure fitted inside the cylindrical internal cavity <b>105</b> of cask <b>100</b> leaves a plurality of unused peripheral areas or regions <b>117</b> between the cask circumferential wall <b>102</b> and basket. These regions have a par-polygonal shape comprising one outer non-polygonal side formed by an arcuate portion of the cask wall <b>102</b> and remaining polygonal inner sides of linear shape formed by parts of the fuel basket <b>115</b>. Peripheral regions <b>117</b> are dead zones serving typically no function and considered wasted space. Accordingly, such peripheral regions are generally kept to a minimum as much as practical.
