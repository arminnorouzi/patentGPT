level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Chinese patent application No. 202110732742.3, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to the field of wireless communication technology and, more particularly, relates to a liquid crystal antenna.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A liquid crystal antenna is a new type of array antenna based on a liquid crystal phase shifter, and has been widely used in satellite receiving antenna, vehicle radar, base station antenna and any other field. The liquid crystal phase shifter is a core component of the liquid crystal antenna. An electric field is formed between the liquid crystal phase shifter and a ground layer to control the deflection of liquid crystal molecules, thereby achieving the control of an equivalent dielectric constant of the liquid crystal, and achieving the adjustment of the phase of the electromagnetic wave.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Based on different frequencies and radiation ranges, the liquid crystal antenna has put different requirements on the internal phase-shifting device, for example, the size and quantity of transmission electrodes used to transmit microwave signals are different. The quantity of transmission electrodes of a conventional small antenna is in a range of approximately 16-64, but large array antennas need hundreds of transmission electrodes, and each transmission electrode needs to have at least one wire connected to the power supply terminal on the step of the liquid crystal antenna to independently control each transmission electrode after being energized. Therefore, the wire connected to the transmission electrode farthest from the step becomes very long and the resistance increases, which increases the charging time period of the transmission electrode at the far end of the power supply terminal, and causes the phases of the transmission electrodes at the far end and near end of the power supply terminal to be unable to output synchronously. Thus, the phase control accuracy is not high, which further affects the gain of the antenna and the consistency and phase accuracy of the entire antenna.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to solve the difference in the liquid crystal deflection electric fields between the transmission electrodes in the liquid crystal antenna, thereby solving the issue of precise phase control of the transmission electrode, making the phase control response substantially fast and accurate, and improving the performance of the liquid crystal antenna, is an urgent technical problem that needs to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present disclosure provides a liquid crystal antenna. The liquid crystal antenna includes a first substrate and a second substrate that are oppositely disposed, and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the first substrate and the second substrate. The liquid crystal antenna also includes a plurality of transmission electrodes arranged in an array and a plurality of signal lines that are disposed on a side of the first substrate facing toward the second substrate, and a ground electrode disposed on a side of the second substrate facing toward the first substrate. Further, the liquid crystal antenna includes a first region and at least one binding region. The first region and a binding region of the at least one binding region are arranged along a first direction. The plurality of transmission electrodes are located in the first region, and a plurality of signal terminals sequentially arranged along a second direction are located in the binding region, where the first direction intersects the second direction. A transmission electrode of the plurality of transmission electrodes is electrically connected to a signal terminal of the plurality of signal terminals through at least one signal line of the plurality of signal lines. Along the first direction, the plurality of transmission electrodes at least include a first transmission electrode and a second transmission electrode, and the first transmission electrode is located on a side of the second transmission electrode away from the binding region. The plurality of signal lines at least include a first signal line and a second signal line, and the plurality of signal terminals at least include a first signal terminal and a second signal terminal. The first transmission electrode is connected to the first signal terminal through the first signal line, and the second transmission electrode is connected to the second signal terminal through the second signal line. A resistance of the first signal line is A, and a resistance of the second signal line is B, where A/B is less than 10.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other aspects of the present disclosure can be understood by those skilled in the art in light of the description, the claims, and the drawings of the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To more clearly illustrate the embodiments of the present disclosure, the drawings will be briefly described below.

In other words, although along the first direction X, the distance between the first transmission electrode <b>401</b> and the binding region BA is different from the distance between the second transmission electrode <b>402</b> and the binding region BA, the resistance difference of the signal lines <b>50</b> connected to the any two transmission electrodes <b>40</b> with different distances from the binding region BA may be substantially small.

Thus, the time periods of charging the two transmission electrodes <b>40</b> through different signal lines <b>50</b> may be consistent as much as possible, and the intensity difference of the liquid crystal deflection electric fields at different positions may be reduced. Further, the fast or slow charging time period caused by the different resistance of the signal line <b>50</b> connected to the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the far end and the signal line <b>50</b> connected to the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the near end may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the near end may be charged fast due to the small resistance of the signal line <b>50</b> connected thereto, and the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the far end may be charged slow due to the large resistance of the signal line <b>50</b> connected thereto. Thus, at a same time, the electric field between the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the far end and the ground electrode <b>60</b> may not achieve a same intensity as the electric field between the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the near end and the ground electrode <b>60</b>. Further, the intensities of the liquid crystal deflection electric fields at the far end and the near end may be different, which may cause a difference in the deflection of liquid crystal molecules, may cause an inaccurate phase control, and may affect the performance of the antenna. In the present disclosure, the phase of the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the far end and the phase of the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the near end may be synchronously outputted as much as possible, and the phase control of the liquid crystal antenna <b>000</b> may be substantially accurate, which may facilitate to improve the gain of the liquid crystal antenna and the phase accuracy of the entire liquid crystal antenna.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, because along the first direction X, the distance between the first transmission electrode <b>401</b> and the binding region BA is different from the distance between the second transmission electrode <b>402</b> and the binding region BA, the first signal line <b>501</b> may have a length different from the second signal line <b>502</b>, which may easily cause the resistance of the first signal line <b>501</b> to be different from the resistance of the second signal line <b>502</b> and may cause different signal transmission effects. For example, under the same other conditions, the first signal line <b>501</b> may have a larger length, and, thus, may have a larger resistance, the second signal line <b>502</b> may have a smaller length, and, thus, may have a smaller resistance. Therefore, to reduce the resistance difference between different signal lines <b>50</b> connected to the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the far end and the transmission electrode <b>40</b> at the near end, the resistance difference may be adjusted by reducing a width of the second signal line <b>502</b> connected to the second transmission electrode <b>402</b> at the near end or by increasing a width of the first signal line <b>501</b> connected to the first transmission electrode <b>401</b> at the far end.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It should be understood that how to control the ratio of the resistance A of the first signal line <b>501</b> over the resistance B of the second signal line <b>502</b> to be less than 10 may not be limited by the present disclosure. In specific implementation, by changing the material, the width, the cross-sectional area, and the length, etc., of the signal line <b>50</b>, the value of A/B may be less than 10, to reduce the resistance difference as much as possible (in conjunction with a wire resistance calculation formula R=&#x3c1;L/S, where &#x3c1; represents a resistivity of the wire material, which is determined by its own material, L represents a length of the wire, and S represents a cross-sectional area of the wire).

During the transmission of the microwave signal, by controlling the voltages on the transmission electrode and the ground electrode, the intensity of the electric field formed between the transmission electrode and the ground electrode may be controlled, and then the deflection angle of the liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer in the corresponding space may be adjusted, thereby achieving the effect of changing the phase of the microwave.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Each transmission electrode of the liquid crystal antenna may be independently controlled by at least one signal line electrically connected to the signal terminal.

The resistance of the first signal line may be A, and the resistance of the second signal line may be B, where A/B may be less than 10, to minimize resistance difference between different signal lines connected to the transmission electrode at the far end and the transmission electrode at the near end.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Thus, the time periods of charging the two transmission electrodes through different signal lines may be consistent as much as possible, and the intensity difference of the liquid crystal deflection electric fields at different positions may be reduced. Further, the fast or slow charging time period caused by the different resistances of the signal lines connected to the transmission electrode at the far end and the signal line connected to the transmission electrode at the near end may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">For example, the transmission electrode at the near end may be charged fast due to the small resistance of the signal line connected thereto, and the transmission electrode at the fare end may be charged slowly due to the large resistance of the signal line connected thereto. Thus, at a same time, the electric field between the transmission electrode at the far end and the ground electrode may not achieve a same intensity as the electric field between the transmission electrode at the near end and the ground electrode. Further, the intensities of the liquid crystal deflection electric fields at the far end and the near end may be different, which may cause a difference in the liquid crystal deflection, may cause an inaccurate phase control, and may affect the performance of the antenna.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the present disclosure, the phase of the transmission electrode at the far end and the phase of the transmission electrode at the near end may be synchronously outputted as much as possible, and the phase control of the liquid crystal antenna may be substantially accurate, which may facilitate to improve the gain of the liquid crystal antenna and the phase accuracy of the entire liquid crystal antenna.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to illustrate the present disclosure to those skilled in the art.
