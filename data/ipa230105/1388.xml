Specific examples are demonstrated through one-pot precipitation reactions and physical mixing with zeolites.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis is a collection of chemical processes which use CO and H<sub>2 </sub>as feedstock to produce longer-chain hydrocarbons. These processes usually take place over catalysts based on Co, Fe, Ru and even Ni and Re. However, conventional catalysts and processes are known to produce mainly paraffins and/or gasoline product fractions, with low yield for light olefins.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recent interest has re-surfaced on the use of Fe in the direct Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) process due to its lower cost compared to other materials, as well as its promising selectivity to light olefin production (C2-C4). In particular, Fe-based catalysts promoted with elements such as alkali metals, alkali earth metals, transition metals and lanthanides have shown various enhancements, such as active site dispersion, faster activation, suppression of methane and improvement to olefinicity of hydrocarbon products.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Effective Fe-based catalysts for FTO require that the selectivity for light olefins be high and that for CH<sub>4 </sub>and C5+ (hydrocarbons comprising 5 or more carbons) to be low. However, known Fe-based catalysts have only been able to produce mainly paraffins and/or gasoline product fractions. Further, for known Fe-based catalysts, the product distribution is limited by the so-called Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) theory, which shows that it is difficult to maximize the selectivity for C2-C4 olefins without concurrently increasing the selectivity for CH<sub>4 </sub>and/or C5+.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is therefore a need to provide a catalyst and a method of use thereof that overcomes or at least ameliorates, one or more of the disadvantages described above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, there is provided a hybrid iron nanoparticle catalyst comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">i) 30 to 70 wt. % of nanoparticles comprising iron and at least one of a metal M selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals of groups 3 to 7 and 9 to 11 of the Periodic Table of Elements, lanthanides and combinations of M thereof; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">ii) 70 to 30 wt. % of an aluminosilicate or silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, based on the total weight of the catalyst</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">wherein said nanoparticle has a diameter of about 2 to 50 nm, and the total wt. % of the nanoparticles and zeolite is 100 wt. %.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">Advantageously, the presently described hybrid iron nanoparticle catalyst may demonstrate improved activity over the Fischer Tropsch iron catalysts known in the art. High selectivity and conversion of the gas comprising hydrogen and an oxide of carbon to the desired light olefins may be achieved utilizing the catalysts as described herein. This may be attributed to the high percentage of the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals or lanthanide in the catalyst, as well as the porous nature of the zeolite.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">In an example, the presently described catalyst may adopt a spinel crystalline phase.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">Advantageously, nanoparticle catalysts having the spinel phase may demonstrate improved conversion of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide to light olefins, particularly light olefins comprising 2 to 4 carbon atoms, with up to 24 mol.

In particular, the iron nanoparticles contain a high loading of alkali metals (&#x2dc;10-20 wt. %) of which the type is dependent on the metal hydroxide precipitant (e.g. Li, Na, K, Cs). For instance, Na can be incorporated into the iron phase through precipitation, with iron forming a dominant spinel phase which is not identified as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).

The precipitate is collected via centrifugation without washing and dried in air before calcination in air at 500&#xb0; C. for at least 2 hours or 5 hours to obtain Fe-based spinel nanoparticles. This method produces X-promoted nano-particles of about 4-5 nm in size in a single precipitation and calcination step without the need for any washing protocol to remove the X cation and offers good performance in light olefin (C2-C4) selectivity and yield.

The method begins by mixing a salt of Fe, such as Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, a salt of X if promotion with X is desired, and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in deionized water. NaOH solution is used to precipitate the iron and X from the solution.

The precipitate is then collected via centrifugation without washing and dried in air before being calcined in air at 500&#xb0; C. or higher for at least 2 hours. This method produces X-promoted nano-particles of about 4-5 nm in size in a single precipitation and calcination step without the need for any washing protocol to remove the Na cation and offers good performance in light olefin (C2-C4) selectivity, yield and enhanced stability.
