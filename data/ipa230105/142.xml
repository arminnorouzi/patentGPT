More particularly, this disclosure relates to piercing assemblies for use in shisha devices.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditional shisha devices are used to smoke tobacco and are configured such that vapor and smoke pass through a water basin before inhalation by a consumer. Shisha devices may include one outlet, or more than one outlet so that the device may be used by more than one consumer at a time. Use of shisha devices is considered by some to be a leisure activity and a social experience.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, traditional shishas are used in combination with a substrate, sometimes referred to in the art as hookah tobacco, tobacco molasses, or simply as molasses. Traditional shisha substrates are relatively high in sugar (in some cases, up to &#x2dc;50% vs. the &#x2dc;20% typically found in conventional tobacco substrates, such as in combustible cigarettes). The tobacco used in shisha devices may be mixed with other ingredients to, for example, increase the volume of the vapor and smoke produced, to alter flavor, or both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional shisha devices employ charcoal, such as charcoal pellets to heat and sometimes combust the tobacco substrate to generate an aerosol for inhalation by a user. Using charcoal to heat the tobacco may cause full or partial combustion of the tobacco or other ingredients. Additionally, charcoal may generate harmful or potentially harmful products, such as carbon monoxide, which may mix with the shisha vapor and pass through the water basin to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the production of carbon monoxide and combustion by-products is to employ e-liquids rather than tobacco. Shisha devices that employ e-liquids eliminate combustion by-products but deprive shisha consumers of the traditional tobacco-based experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other shisha devices have been proposed that employ electric heaters to heat, but not combust, tobacco. Such electrically heated heat-not-burn shisha devices heat the tobacco substrate to a temperature sufficient to produce an aerosol from the substrate without combusting the substrate, and therefore reduce or eliminate by-products associated with combustion of tobacco.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Shisha devices may employ a cartridge for housing an aerosol-forming substrate. The cartridge may be filled with such aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may comprise tobacco, preferably shisha substrate, such as molasses&#x2014;a mixture of tobacco, water, sugar, and other components, such as glycerine, flavors, etc. The heating system of the electrically heated shisha device heats the contents of the cartridge to generate aerosol, which is conveyed through an airflow path to a user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to facilitate airflow through the cartridge and the flow of the aerosol from the cartridge, a shisha cartridge may have one or more holes through one or more walls. The cartridge may include one or more holes at the top, one or more holes at the bottom, or both one or more holes at the top and one or more holes at the bottom. Alternatively, the top may be open, that is, the top wall may be partially or completely absent.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Prior art cartridges typically have one or more openings on at least one of the walls of the cartridge, such as in one or both of the top and bottom walls. At least some of the holes or openings in the top and bottom walls may be closed by a removable (for example, peelable) sealing layer, such as a film, sticker, or liner, during storage. The removable layer may protect the contents (for example, the molasses) from exposure to air and oxygen. The removable layer may be removed (for example, pulled or peeled off) by a user prior to first use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The holes or openings in the cartridge, if left unsealed, may lead to loss of freshness (for example, moisture content) or contamination of the substrate, as well as issues with leakage. For one or more reasons, such as in order to maintain freshness, to prevent leakage of the substrate, or to preserve the quality and integrity of the substrate during storage, it is desirable to form the openings or holes of the cartridge only immediately prior to use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly for piercing cartridges used in aerosol-generating devices. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that can be incorporated as part of an aerosol-generating device. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that does not require additional equipment in addition to the aerosol-generating device. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that is convenient and easy to use. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that can be used with a cartridge that does not have pre-formed air inlets or outlets. It would be desirable to provide a piercing assembly that reduces the chance of injury to the user when piercing a cartridge.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, a piercing assembly is provided that can be used in aerosol-generating devices. For example, the piercing assembly may be used in shisha devices. The piercing assembly may be used to form one or more openings in a cartridge. For example, the piercing assembly may be used to form one or more openings in a shisha cartridge.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The piercing assembly may be mounted onto or may be integral with a stem pipe. The stem pipe may be incorporated as part of an aerosol-generating device. The stem pipe may be incorporated as part of a shisha device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The piercing assembly comprises a body with a through opening. The opening may be coaxial with the hollow tube of the stem pipe. The piercing assembly comprises a plurality of piercing elements at its upstream end. The piercing elements are configured for piercing (for example, creating one or more holes in) a cartridge.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The piercing assembly may be operated by inserting a cartridge into a cap or into the piercing assembly disposed at the mouth of the aerosol-generating device vessel. The cap may be placed onto the piercing assembly, and the cap along with the cartridge may be pressed down toward the piercing assembly. The piercing elements of the piercing assembly may pierce (for example, create one or more holes in) the cartridge. The aerosol-generating device may be a shisha device and the cartridge may be a shish cartridge.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The piercing system of the present disclosure may provide various advantages to both the manufacturer and the user. Some of the advantages include that the piercing system is convenient, easy, and safe to use. The user of the shisha device does not need additional equipment to pierce a cartridge. Further, the user can pierce the cartridge without having to directly handle a piercing element, reducing the chance of injury from sharp objects. The piercing assembly may also allow the cartridge to be pierced without removing a sticker or film from the cartridge. The cartridge may be placed into the shisha device prior to opening of the cartridge. The piercing assembly thus reduces the chance of leaks and other messes. The piercing element enables the use of a cartridge without pre-formed perforations. This allows for cheaper, faster, and easier manufacturing of cartridges.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the piercing system may comprise a stem pipe comprising a hollow tube extending from an upstream end to a downstream end along a longitudinal axis; and a piercing assembly at the upstream end of the stem pipe.

A shisha device may comprise a vessel comprising an interior volume configured for housing a liquid. The vessel may comprise a mouth in fluid communication with the interior volume. The shisha device may comprise a cap comprising a receptacle for receiving a cartridge. The shisha device may also comprise a stem pipe. The stem pipe may comprise a hollow tube that provides a part of the air flow path within the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The stem pipe may be mounted at the mouth of the vessel. The stem pipe comprises a hollow tube with an upstream end and a downstream end and an airflow path extending through the hollow tube from the upstream end to the downstream end. The downstream end of the stem pipe extends into the interior volume of the vessel. In use, the downstream end of the stem pipe typically extends below a liquid level inside the vessel. The piercing assembly may be mounted onto the upstream end of the stem pipe. Alternatively, the piercing assembly may be integrally formed as a part of the stem pipe. As a cartridge is placed at the piercing assembly and pushed down, the piercing assembly engages one or more walls of the cartridge, piercing one or more openings into the wall. Advantageously, the user is able to pierce the cartridge without the need for additional equipment. Further, the user may pierce the cartridge without coming into contact with the piercing elements themselves, thus reducing the chance of injury from sharp objects. The piercing assembly may reduce the chance of leaks and other messes from a cartridge with openings because the openings are only formed after the cartridge is placed in the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The piercing assembly comprises a body with an upstream end and a downstream end. The body may comprise a through opening extending from the upstream end to the downstream end. The through opening advantageously enables airflow down through the stem pipe.

The track and pin cooperate to guide the rotational motion of the body about the center axis when the body is moved downward. The piercing system may further include a compression spring. The compression spring may be configured to bias the body upward by applying a spring force to the body. For example, when a user presses the cartridge down to pierce the cartridge, the cartridge presses down on the body, causing the body to move down in a rotating motion. Once the user lets go of the cartridge, the spring may return the body to its original position. The stem pipe may include a flange that supports the spring. The body may include a ledge that rests or pushes down on the spring. In some embodiments, the rotatably movable body is combined with piercing elements comprising a piercing edge curved along the length of the piercing element.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the piercing assembly comprises an absorption element.

The RTD of a specimen refers to the static pressure difference between the two ends of the specimen when it is traversed by an air flow under steady conditions in which the volumetric flow is 17.5 milliliters per second at the output end. The RTD of a specimen may be measured using the method set out in ISO Standard 6565:2002.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The one or more openings, once formed, on the body may cover 5% or greater, 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, or 25% or greater of the area of the wall the openings are on. For example, if the openings are on the top wall, the openings may cover at least 5% of the area of the top wall. The one or more openings on the body may cover 75% or less, 50% or less, 40% or less, or 30% or less of the area of the wall the openings are on.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cartridge may further include a seal or layer covering one or more preformed openings prior to use. The cartridge may include a first removable seal covering the one or more inlets and a second removable seal covering the one or more outlets. The first and second seals are preferably sufficient to prevent air flow through the inlets and outlets to prevent leakage of the contents of the cartridge and to extend shelf life. The seal may comprise a peelable label of sticker, foil, or the like. The seal may comprise a pierceable label of sticker, foil, or the like. The label, sticker, or foil may be affixed to the cartridge in any suitable manner, such as with an adhesive, crimping, welding, or otherwise being joined to the container. The seal may comprise a tab that may be grasped to peel or remove the label, sticker, or foil from the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments the cartridge is a shisha cartridge that may be used with any suitable shisha device. Preferably, the shisha device is configured to sufficiently heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge to form an aerosol from the aerosol-forming substrate but not to combust the aerosol-forming substrate. For example, the shisha device may be configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature in a range from about 150&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C.; more preferably from about 180&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C. or from about 200&#xb0; C. to about 230&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The shisha device may include a receptacle for receiving the cartridge. The shisha device may comprise a heating element. The heating element may be configured to contact or to be in proximity to the body of the cartridge when the cartridge is received in the receptacle. The heating element may form at least part of the receptacle. For example, the heating element may form at least a portion of the surface of the receptacle. The shisha cartridge may be configured to transfer heat from the heating element to the aerosol-forming substrate in the cavity by conduction. In some embodiments, the heating element includes an electric heating element. In some embodiments, the heating element includes a resistive heating component. For example, the heating element may include one or more resistive wires or other resistive elements. The resistive wires may be in contact with a thermally conductive material to distribute heat produced over a broader area. Examples of suitable conductive materials include aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel, silver, and combinations thereof. The heating element may form at least a portion of the surface of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The shisha device may include control electronics operably coupled to the heating element. The control electronics may be configured to control heating of the heating element. The control electronics may be configured to control the temperature to which the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is heated. The control electronics may be provided in any suitable form and may, for example, include a controller or a memory and a controller. The controller may include one or more of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) state machine, a digital signal processor, a gate array, a microprocessor, or equivalent discrete or integrated logic circuitry. Control electronics may include memory that contains instructions that cause one or more components of the circuitry to carry out a function or aspect of the control electronics. Functions attributable to control electronics in this disclosure may be embodied as one or more of software, firmware, and hardware.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The electronic circuitry may include a microprocessor, which may be a programmable microprocessor. The electronic circuitry may be configured to regulate a supply of power. The power may be supplied to the heater element in the form of pulses of electrical current.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some examples, the control electronics may be configured to monitor the electrical resistance of the heating element and to control the supply of power to the heating element depending on the electrical resistance of the heating element. In this manner, the control electronics may regulate the temperature of the resistive element.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The shisha device may include a temperature sensor, such as a thermocouple. The temperature sensor may be operably coupled to the control electronics to control the temperature of the heating element. The temperature sensor may be positioned in any suitable location. For example, the temperature sensor may be configured to insert into the cartridge when received within the receptacle to monitor the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate being heated. In addition or alternatively, the temperature sensor may be in contact with the heating element. In addition or alternatively, the temperature sensor may be positioned to detect temperature at an aerosol outlet of the shisha device or a portion thereof. The sensor may transmit signals regarding the sensed temperature to the control electronics. The control electronics may adjust heating of the heating elements in response to the signal to achieve a suitable temperature at the sensor.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The control electronics may be operably coupled to a power supply. The shisha device may include any suitable power supply. For example, a power supply of a shisha device may be a battery or set of batteries. The batteries of the power supply may be rechargeable, removable and replaceable, or rechargeable and removable and replaceable. Any suitable battery may be used. For example, heavy duty type or standard batteries existing in the market, such as used for industrial heavy-duty electrical power-tools. Alternatively, the power supply may be any type of electric power supply including a super or hyper-capacitor. Alternatively, the assembly may be connected to an external electrical power source, and electrically and electronically designed for such purpose. Regardless of the type of power supply employed, the power supply preferably provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least one shisha session until aerosol is depleted from the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source. Preferably, the power supply provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least about 70 minutes of continuous operation of the device, before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one example, a shisha device includes an aerosol-generating element that includes a cartridge receptacle, a heating element, an aerosol outlet, and an air inlet. The cartridge receptacle is configured to receive a cartridge according to the present disclosure containing the aerosol-forming substrate. The heating element may define at least part of a surface of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The shisha device includes an air inlet channel in fluid connection with the receptacle. In use, when the substrate inside the cartridge is heated, aerosol former components in the substrate vaporize. Air flowing from the air inlet channel through the cartridge becomes entrained with aerosol generated from the aerosol former components in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Some electrically heated shisha devices employ pre-heated air and typically employ an airflow path such that the air travels in the vicinity of the heat source upon puffing. Further, some electrically heated shisha devices employ elements that increase radiation heat transfer by increasing the heated surface area.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The air inlet channel may include one or more apertures through the cartridge receptacle such that air from outside the shisha device may flow through the channel and into the cartridge receptacle through the one or more apertures. If a channel includes more than one aperture, the channel may include a manifold to direct air flowing through the channel to each aperture. Preferably, the shisha device includes two or more air inlet channels.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As described above, the cartridge may include one or more openings (such as inlets or outlets) formed in the cartridge body, allowing air to flow through the cartridge (for example, after having been pierced by the piercing assembly). If the receptacle includes one or more inlet apertures, at least some of the inlets in the cartridge may align with the apertures in the top of the receptacle. The cartridge may include an alignment feature configured to mate with a complementary alignment feature of the receptacle to align the inlets of the cartridge with the apertures of the receptacle when the cartridge is inserted into the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Air that enters the cartridge may flow across or through, or both across and through the aerosol-forming substrate, entraining aerosol, and exiting the cartridge and receptacle via an aerosol outlet. From the aerosol outlet, the air carrying the aerosol enters a vessel of the shisha device via the stem pipe.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The shisha device may include any suitable vessel defining an interior volume configured to contain a liquid and defining an outlet in the headspace above a liquid fill level. The vessel may include an optically transparent or opaque housing to allow a consumer to observe contents contained in the vessel. The vessel may include a liquid fill demarcation, such as a liquid fill line. The vessel housing may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the vessel housing may include glass or suitable rigid plastic material. Preferably, the vessel is removable from a portion of the shisha assembly comprising the aerosol-generation element to allow a consumer to fill, empty or clean the vessel.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The vessel may be filled to a liquid fill level by a consumer. The liquid preferably includes water, which may optionally be infused with one or more colorants, flavorants, or colorants and flavorants. For example, the water may be infused with one or both of botanical and herbal infusions.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Aerosol entrained in air exiting the aerosol outlet of the receptacle may travel through a conduit positioned in the vessel. The conduit may be coupled to the aerosol outlet of the aerosol-generating element and may have an opening below the liquid fill level of the vessel, such that aerosol flowing through the vessel flows through the opening of the conduit, then through the liquid, into headspace of the vessel and exits through a headspace outlet, for delivery to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The headspace outlet may be coupled to a hose comprising a mouthpiece for delivering the aerosol to a consumer. The mouthpiece may include an activation element, such as a switch activatable by a user, a puff sensor arranged to detect a user puffing on the mouthpiece, or both a switch activatable by the user and a puff sensor. The activation element is operably coupled to the control electronics of the shisha device. The activation element may be wirelessly coupled to the control electronics. Activation of the activation element may cause the control electronics to activate the heating element, rather than constantly supplying energy to the heating element. Accordingly, the use of an activation element may serve to save energy relative to devices not employing such elements to provide on-demand heating rather than constant heating.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For purposes of example, one method for using a shisha device as described herein is provided below in chronological order. The vessel may be detached from other components of the shisha device and filled with water. One or more of natural fruit juices, botanicals, and herbal infusions may be added to the water for flavoring. The amount of liquid added should cover a portion of the conduit but should not exceed a fill level mark that may optionally exist on the vessel. The vessel is then reassembled to the shisha device. The cartridge may be placed directly onto the body of the piercing assembly. The cap may be placed onto the piercing assembly and cartridge such that the cartridge is received in the receptacle inside the cap. In some embodiments, the cartridge is placed inside the receptacle of the cap, and the cap is used to place the cartridge onto the piercing assembly. The user may press on the cartridge or may use the cap to push the cartridge down against the piercing elements to pierce one or more walls of the cartridge. The device may then be turned on. Turning on the device may initiate a heating profile of a heating element, to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature at or above a vaporization temperature but below a combustion temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol forming compounds of the aerosol-forming substrate vaporize, generating an aerosol. The user may puff on the mouthpiece as desired. The user may continue using the device as long as desired or until no more aerosol is visible or being delivered. In some embodiments, the device may be arranged to automatically shut off when the cartridge or a compartment of the cartridge is depleted of usable aerosol-forming substrate. In some embodiments, the consumer may refill the device with a fresh cartridge after, for example, receiving the cue from the device that the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is depleted or nearly depleted. The shisha device may be turned off at any time by a consumer by, for example, switching off the device.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The shisha device may have any suitable air management. In one example, puffing action from the user will create a suction effect causing a low pressure inside the device which will cause external air to flow through an air inlet of the device, into the air inlet channel, and into the receptacle. The air may then flow through the cartridge in the receptacle and become entrained with aerosol produced from the aerosol-forming substrate. The air with entrained aerosol then exits the aerosol outlet of the receptacle, flows through the conduit to the liquid inside the vessel. The aerosol will then bubble out of the liquid and into head space in the vessel above the level of the liquid, out the headspace outlet, and through the hose and mouthpiece for delivery to the consumer. The flow of external air and the flow of the aerosol inside the shisha device may be driven by the action of puffing from the user.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Reference will now be made to the drawings, which depict one or more embodiments described in this disclosure.

In the third position P<b>3</b>, an airflow path is open through the openings formed in the cartridge <b>200</b>, and is open between an exterior of the shisha device and the vessel. To release and remove the cap <b>400</b>, the user may again press on the cap outer frame <b>410</b>, causing the cap outer frame <b>410</b> and the outer shroud <b>420</b> to move to a fourth position P<b>4</b>, from where the compression spring <b>470</b> returns the cap outer frame <b>410</b> and the outer shroud <b>420</b> to the initial first position P<b>1</b>. The movement of the cap during the second instance of pushing down on the cap to release the cap is defined by the second portion of the track.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Thus, piercing systems for shisha devices are described.
