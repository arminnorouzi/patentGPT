herein are directed to artificial muscle chair devices that include artificial muscles configured to apply pressure to an occupant of a chair. The artificial muscles are more lightweight than traditional motors or actuators, making them better-suited than traditional motors for use in vehicles for a variety of reasons such as vehicle handling and fuel economy, for example. The artificial muscle chair devices described herein may include layered actuation structures having actuation platforms interleaved with mounting platforms to form actuation cavities therebetween. The artificial muscle chair devices described herein may include artificial muscles embedded in a chair, where each artificial muscle comprises a housing having an electrode region and an expandable fluid region, a first electrode and a second electrode each disposed in the electrode region of the housing. A dielectric fluid may be disposed within the housing, where the first and second electrodes may electrostatically attract, inflating the expandable fluid region with dielectric fluid and thereby applying selective pressure to the chair. Artificial muscles, whether individually or collectively, may then provide a variety of beneficial types of pressure, such as massaging patterns of pressure, and/or haptic feedback based upon occupant input, vehicle operation, and/or as output from an infotainment device. Various embodiments of the artificial muscle chair devices and the operation of which, are described in more detail herein.

At least one of the one or more artificial muscles <b>100</b> of the artificial muscle group <b>10</b> may be in the actuated state at a given time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the artificial muscle <b>100</b> is shown in the non-actuated state. The electrode pair <b>104</b> is provided within the electrode region <b>194</b> of the unsealed portion <b>192</b> of the housing <b>110</b>. The central opening <b>146</b> of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the central opening <b>168</b> of the second electrode <b>108</b> are coaxially aligned within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. In the non-actuated state, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> are partially spaced apart from and non-parallel to one another. Due to the first film layer <b>122</b> being sealed to the second film layer <b>124</b> around the electrode pair <b>104</b>, the second end <b>136</b>, <b>158</b> of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> are brought into contact with one another. Thus, dielectric fluid <b>198</b> is provided between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, thereby separating the first end <b>134</b>, <b>156</b> of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> proximate the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. Stated another way, a distance between the first end <b>134</b> of the tab portion <b>132</b> of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the first end <b>156</b> of the tab portion <b>154</b> of the second electrode <b>108</b> is greater than a distance between the second end <b>136</b> of the tab portion <b>132</b> of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second end <b>158</b> of the tab portion <b>154</b> of the second electrode <b>108</b>. This results in the electrode pair <b>104</b> zippering toward the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> when actuated. In some embodiments, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> may be flexible. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> are convex such that the second ends <b>136</b>, <b>158</b> of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> thereof may remain close to one another, but spaced apart from one another proximate the central openings <b>146</b>, <b>168</b>. In the non-actuated state, the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> has a first height H<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When actuated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> zipper toward one another from the second ends <b>144</b>, <b>158</b> of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> thereof, thereby pushing the dielectric fluid <b>198</b> into the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. As shown, when in the actuated state, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> are parallel to one another. In the actuated state, the dielectric fluid <b>198</b> flows into the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> to inflate the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. As such, the first film layer <b>122</b> and the second film layer <b>124</b> expand in opposite directions. In the actuated state, the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> has a second height H<b>2</b>, which is greater than the first height H<b>1</b> of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> when in the non-actuated state. Although not shown, it should be noted that the electrode pair <b>104</b> may be partially actuated to a position between the non-actuated state and the actuated state. This would allow for partial inflation of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> and adjustments when necessary.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to move the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> toward one another, a voltage is applied by a power supply (such as power supply <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). In some embodiments, a voltage of up to 10 kV may be provided from the power supply to induce an electric field through the dielectric fluid <b>198</b>. The resulting attraction between the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> pushes the dielectric fluid <b>198</b> into the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. Pressure from the dielectric fluid <b>198</b> within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> causes the first film layer <b>122</b> and the first electrical insulator layer <b>111</b> to deform in a first axial direction along the center axis C of the first electrode <b>106</b> and causes the second film layer <b>124</b> and the second electrical insulator layer <b>112</b> to deform in an opposite second axial direction along the center axis C of the second electrode <b>108</b>. Once the voltage being supplied to the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> is discontinued, the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> return to their initial, non-parallel position in the non-actuated state.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be appreciated that the present embodiments of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> disclosed herein, specifically, the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> with the interconnecting bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b>, provide a number of improvements over actuators that do not include the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b>, such as hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators described in the paper titled &#x201c;<i>Hydraulically amplified self</i>-<i>healing electrostatic actuators with muscle</i>-<i>like performance</i>&#x201d; by E. Acome, S. K. Mitchell, T. G. Morrissey, M. B. Emmett, C. Benjamin, M. King, M. Radakovitz, and C. Keplinger (Science 5 Jan. 2018: Vol. 359, Issue 6371, pp. 61-65). Embodiments of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> including two pairs of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> on each of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, respectively, reduces the overall mass and thickness of the artificial muscle <b>100</b>, reduces the amount of voltage required during actuation, and decreases the total volume of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> without reducing the amount of resulting force after actuation as compared to known HASEL actuators including donut-shaped electrodes having a uniform, radially-extending width. More particularly, the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> provide zipping fronts that result in increased actuation power by providing localized and uniform hydraulic actuation of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> compared to HASEL actuators including donut-shaped electrodes. Specifically, one pair of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> provides twice the amount of actuator power per unit volume as compared to donut-shaped HASEL actuators, while two pairs of tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> provide four times the amount of actuator power per unit volume. The bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> interconnecting the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> also limit buckling of the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> by maintaining the distance between adjacent tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> during actuation. Because the bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> are integrally formed with the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b>, the bridge portions <b>174</b>, <b>176</b> also prevent leakage between the tab portions <b>132</b>, <b>154</b> by eliminating attachment locations that provide an increased risk of rupturing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation, when the artificial muscle <b>100</b> is actuated by providing a voltage and applying the voltage to the electrode pair <b>104</b> of the artificial muscle <b>100</b>, expansion of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> produces a force of 3 Newton-millimeters (N&#xb7;mm) per cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>) of actuator volume or greater, such as 4 N&#xb7;mm per cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater, 5 N&#xb7;mm per cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater, 6 N&#xb7;mm per cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater, 7 N&#xb7;mm per cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater, 8 N&#xb7;mm per cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater, or the like. Providing the voltage may comprise generating the voltage, for example, in an embodiment in which the power supply <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) is a battery, converting the voltage, for example in embodiment in which the power supply <b>48</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) is a power adaptor, or any other known or yet to be developed technique for readying a voltage for application. In one example, when the artificial muscle <b>100</b> is actuated by a voltage of 9.5 kilovolts (kV), the artificial muscle <b>100</b> provides a resulting force of 5 N. In another example, when the artificial muscle <b>100</b> is actuated by a voltage of 10 kV the artificial muscle <b>100</b> provides 440% strain under a 500 gram load.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, the size of the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b> is proportional to the amount of displacement of the dielectric fluid <b>198</b>. Therefore, when greater displacement within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> is desired, the size of the electrode pair <b>104</b> is increased relative to the size of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b>. It should be appreciated that the size of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> is defined by the central openings <b>146</b>, <b>168</b> in the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>. Thus, the degree of displacement within the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> may alternatively, or in addition, be controlled by increasing or reducing the size of the central openings <b>146</b>, <b>168</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, another embodiment of an artificial muscle <b>201</b> is illustrated. The artificial muscle <b>201</b> is substantially similar to the artificial muscle <b>100</b>. As such, like structure is indicated with like reference numerals. However, as shown, the first electrode <b>106</b> does not include a central opening. Thus, only the second electrode <b>108</b> includes the central opening <b>168</b> formed therein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the artificial muscle <b>201</b> is in the non-actuated state with the first electrode <b>106</b> being planar and the second electrode <b>108</b> being convex relative to the first electrode <b>106</b>. In the non-actuated state, the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> has a first height H<b>3</b>. In the actuated state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> has a second height H<b>4</b>, which is greater than the first height H<b>3</b>. It should be appreciated that by providing the central opening <b>168</b> only in the second electrode <b>108</b> as opposed to both the first electrode <b>106</b> and the second electrode <b>108</b>, the total deformation may be formed on one side of the artificial muscle <b>201</b>. In addition, because the total deformation is formed on only one side of the artificial muscle <b>201</b>, the second height H<b>4</b> of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> of the artificial muscle <b>201</b> extends further from a longitudinal axis perpendicular to the central axis C of the artificial muscle <b>201</b> than the second height H<b>2</b> of the expandable fluid region <b>196</b> of the artificial muscle <b>100</b> when all other dimensions, orientations, and volume of dielectric fluid are the same.
