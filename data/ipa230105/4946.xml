2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Payment card based electronic payment transactions can be characterized as two types. One type of transaction is a card present type of transaction, while another type transaction is a card not present type of transaction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a card present type of transaction, a person may use a payment card such as a credit card to conduct the transaction. Prior to conducting the transaction, the merchant may obtain and check the person's payment card to confirm that he is the actual holder of the card. For example, the merchant may ask for the person's driver's license to confirm that the name on the driver's license is the same name that is on the payment card. Once this is done, the person may take the payment card and swipe it by the merchant's POS (point of service) terminal to start the process of authorizing the transaction. The POS terminal may generate and send an authorization request message to an issuer of the payment card. The issuer may subsequently approve or not approve of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another type of payment transaction is a &#x201c;card not present&#x201d; type of transaction. An example of a card not present type of transaction is an online purchase transaction. In a card not present type of transaction, the online merchant does not physically verify that the consumer is actually in possession of a payment card that is being used to conduct the transaction. To purchase goods or services online, a consumer only needs to possess the account number associated with the card and perhaps a card verification value (CVV2) associated with the card. In an online transaction, a human being does not verify that the consumer purchasing the goods is in physical possession of the card that is used to conduct the transaction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because nobody has verified that the person conducting the transaction is actually in physical possession of the card that is being used to conduct the transaction, the possibility of fraud can be considered greater than in a card present type of transaction, as compared to a card not present type of transaction. Because of the higher risk associated with card not present type of transactions, card not present transactions may be subject to higher processing fees (e.g., interchange fees) than card present types of transactions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, mobile phones have been provided with contactless devices (e.g., an RF or radio frequency transmitter), which can allow them to be used as contactless payment devices. Although a mobile phone can be physically present at a physical point of sale when a person conducts a purchase transaction in person at a merchant, the purchase transaction would generally be considered card not present types of transactions. This is because a physical card is not present during the transaction and since the mobile phone would not possess the necessary security attributes (e.g., holograms, card verification values, secure chip) that a card might have. Thus, transactions conducted with contactless phones would likely be subject to higher processing fees than transactions conducted using traditional payment cards, even though contactless phones are used to conduct in person payment transactions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the security of transactions conducted using mobile phones could also be improved. In order to successfully conduct payment transactions using mobile phones, there needs to be a certain degree of trust between the person using the mobile phone, the issuer that is linked to the mobile phone, and the payment processing organization that processes payment transactions conducted with the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would be desirable to improve payment systems and methods so that transactions can be securely conducted with mobile communication devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention address these and other problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the invention include methods and systems that can be used to improve the security and speed of payment transactions conducted using a mobile communication device such as a mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising receiving payment data at an access device, and receiving an identifier for a mobile device at the access device.

In a card present transaction, a consumer is in possession of a portable consumer device, such as a payment card, at a point of sale at a merchant location. The consumer may also conduct a card present transaction with a mobile device, such as a phone, that is enabled with a near-field communication chip, or other suitable chip, to interact with a point of sale device at the merchant location. Since card present transactions are conducted in-person, the merchant can verify the identity of a person wishing to make the transaction as a consumer associated with the payment card.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a card not present transaction, the consumer does not have a payment card at the merchant location. Examples of card not present types of transactions include Internet transactions and mail order and telephone order types of transactions. Because a merchant is not able to verify the presence of a card or verify the identity of the person wishing to conduct the transaction, there are higher risks for merchants and issuers associated with conducting card not present transactions. Thus, card not present transactions can be subject to higher processing fees and/or interchange rates than card present types of transactions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments of the invention provide for greater security. Embodiments of the invention also allow a person to conduct a payment transaction with a mobile device (e.g., a phone) and that payment transaction can be treated as a card present type of payment transaction. This is the case even though the mobile device does not have the type of chip that would normally be required for a card present transaction. Because embodiments of the invention allow transactions conducted using a mobile device to be processed as a card present transaction, processing fees (e.g., interchange fees) can be reduced because the transactions are more secure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Prior to discussing the specific embodiments of the invention, further descriptions of some terms can be provided for a better understanding of embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A &#x201c;verification token&#x201d; may be any suitable piece of information that can be used to verify that a consumer has presented a payment card or other authentic payment credential to a merchant for verification. Verification tokens may be in any suitable form and any suitable length. Verification tokens may be in the form of numbers, letters, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a verification token according to an embodiment of the invention may be the form of an activation code or a portion thereof (e.g., half or less than half of an activation code). In some embodiments, the verification token may be static, while in other embodiments, it may be dynamic.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Payment data&#x201d; may include any suitable information suitable for conducting a payment transaction. Payment data may include an account number, expiration date, service code, CVV (card verification value) and dCVV (dynamic card verification value) values, etc. Payment data can be stored on a mobile device, a payment card, or any other suitable portable consumer device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">&#x201c;Payment card data&#x201d; may be an example of &#x201c;payment data.&#x201d; In the description below, reference to &#x201c;payment data&#x201d; may also be a reference to &#x201c;payment card data&#x201d; if the data is associated with a payment card. &#x201c;Payment card data&#x201d; may include any suitable information associated with a payment card suitable for conducting a payment transaction. Payment card data may be encoded on a magnetic stripe present the payment card, printed or embossed on the payment card, or any other suitable method of display or storage. Exemplary payment cards may include credit cards, debit cards, or any other suitable payment card.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">An &#x201c;identifier&#x201d; for a mobile device can be any suitable information that can be used to identify a mobile device such as a mobile phone. An example of an identifier for a mobile device may be a mobile phone number.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A &#x201c;mobile device&#x201d; may be any suitable mobile communication device. A suitable mobile device may be in the form of a mobile phone, and may include an antenna, as well as a processor and a memory. It may also include a contactless element so that it can communicate using a short range wireless communication medium. A mobile device may be a device that can be easily transported, and can be in any suitable form. For example, suitable mobile devices can be hand-held, compact, and enabled to communicate over a network interface, and may have an associated device identifier (e.g., mobile phone number). In some embodiments, mobile devices may be enabled to download applications (e.g., apps) from a merchant website (e.g., iTunes&#x2122;) to perform specialized tasks. Examples of mobile devices include cellular phones, PDAs, personal computers (PCs), tablets, key fobs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">An &#x201c;access device&#x201d; may be any suitable device that can interact with the mobile device and/or a payment card. Examples of access devices include point of sale (POS) devices, cellular phones, PDAs, personal computers (PCs), tablet PCs, handheld specialized readers, set-top boxes, electronic cash registers (ECRs), automated teller machines (ATMs), virtual cash registers (VCRs), kiosks, security systems, access systems, and the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">An &#x201c;issuer&#x201d; may be any business entity (e.g., a bank). Typically, an issuer is a financial institution, such as a bank. The issuer issues portable consumer devices to the consumer that may be used to conduct a transaction, such as a credit or debit card to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">An &#x201c;acquirer&#x201d; is typically a business entity, e.g., a commercial bank that has a business relationship with a particular merchant. Some entities such as American Express perform both issuer and acquirer functions. Embodiments of the invention encompass such single entity issuer-acquirers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A &#x201c;payment processing network&#x201d; may include data processing subsystems, networks, and operations used to support and deliver authorization services, exception file services, and clearing and settlement services. An exemplary payment processing system may include VisaNet&#x2122;. Payment processing systems such as VisaNet&#x2122; are able to process credit card transactions, debit card transactions, and other types of commercial transactions. VisaNet&#x2122;, in particular, includes a VIP system (Visa Integrated Payments system) which processes authorization requests and a Base II system which performs clearing and settlement services.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A &#x201c;server computer&#x201d; can be a powerful computer or a cluster of computers. For example, the server computer can be a large mainframe, a minicomputer cluster, or a group of servers functioning as a unit. In one example, the server computer may be a database server coupled to a Web server and may host a merchant website.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">An &#x201c;authorization request message&#x201d; can include a request for authorization to conduct an electronic payment transaction. It may further include an issuer account identifier. The issuer account identifier may be a payment card account identifier associated with a payment card. The authorization request message may request that an issuer of the payment card authorize a transaction. An authorization request message according to an embodiment of the invention may comply with ISO 8583, which is a standard for systems that exchange electronic transactions made by cardholders using payment cards.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">An &#x201c;authorization response message&#x201d; can be a message that includes an authorization code, and may typically be produced by an issuer. The authorization response message can provide an indication of whether or not a transaction is authorized.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Authorization request messages, authorization response messages, and other confidential data transmitted may be susceptible to interception, compromising secure data relating to the consumer or the consumer's payment information, such as a payment card identifier. To prevent identity and other payment information theft, &#x201c;encryption&#x201d; may be used. Encryption allows merchants, issuers, acquirers, and other entities to verify the identity of the source of the information (e.g., a valid consumer) by altering data transmitted so that to anyone other than an intended recipient the data is unreadable or meaningless. When the intended recipient receives the data, the intended recipient decrypts the data.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Security keys are often used to encrypt and decrypt messages, and may be used in conjunction with mathematical formulas or algorithms. Security keys are created in pairs, so that if someone encrypts a message with a key, only someone else with a matching key will be able to decrypt the message. There are secret key pairs and public key pairs. Public key encryption is typically used in Internet communications. In public key encryption, there is a &#x201c;public key&#x201d; and a &#x201c;private key.&#x201d; The public key is made freely available, whereas the private key is kept privately and secretly on a consumer's computer, consumer's mobile device, or merchant access device. The public key can encrypt messages, but only the private key can decrypt messages the public key has encrypted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">&#x201c;Digital certificates&#x201d; use encryption to verify that an entity sending data, such as a consumer sending payment card information, is valid (e.g., a consumer sending the payment card information is the consumer associated with the payment card information sent). A digital certificate is unique for each entity, so when a consumer with a digital certificate goes to a merchant website, that digital certificate is presented to the merchant's website and verifies that the consumer is who he or she claims to be. Digital certificates are issued by certificate authorities or other suitable entity not directly involved in a transaction in which digital certificates are needed to verify identities of the parties conducting the transaction.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">I.

Methods</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A method according to an embodiment of the invention can be described with reference to the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with reference to the system diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Embodiments of the invention can allow a consumer to enroll in a program (such as a program to load a verification token on a phone, rewards program, alerts program, or other program) using an access device (e.g., a POS terminal) at a merchant.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, the consumer <b>30</b> can use a payment card (e.g., payment card <b>32</b>-<b>2</b>) to interact with the access device <b>34</b> (step <b>202</b>). Payment data (e.g., an account number, expiration date, service code, etc.), which may include account data, can pass from the card to the access device <b>34</b>. In response to this, the access device <b>34</b> can prompt the user to enter at least his phone number (and other information such as your device ID, e-mail address, etc.) to enroll his phone (e.g., portable mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>) as a payment device (step <b>204</b>). In another embodiment, the consumer <b>30</b> may log onto a computer and may go to a host site or portal (e.g., iTunes&#x2122;) run by the merchant computer <b>22</b>. The consumer's information (e.g., the phone number, e-mail address, birthday, etc.) may then be provided to the access device <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">After the phone number is entered into the access device <b>34</b>, the access device <b>34</b> can then generate a first authorization request message with the phone number and payment card information (e.g., an account number, expiration date, etc.), and this can be sent to the payment processing network <b>26</b> (step <b>206</b>). The phone number and card number can then be stored and linked in a database in the payment processing network <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the payment processing network <b>26</b> can then use this information to communicate with the consumer <b>30</b>. For example, an alert message may be sent to the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> of the consumer <b>30</b> informing the consumer <b>30</b> that he has been enrolled.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The payment processing network <b>26</b> (or a server computer residing therein) can then send a verification token back to the phone (step <b>210</b>). This may occur in any suitable manner. For example, the payment processing network <b>26</b> can send the verification token to the phone (portable consumer device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>) via the acquirer <b>24</b>, merchant <b>22</b>, and access device <b>34</b>. Alternatively, it can send the verification token to the phone (portable consumer device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>) via the telecommunications gateway <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Once the mobile device (mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>) has received the verification token, the verification token (which may take any suitable form including one or more characters, and which may be static or dynamic) may be stored in a memory in the phone. In some cases, the verification token is applicable only at a single merchant, or a single type of merchant. In other cases, it may be used at many different merchants.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Once the mobile device has stored the verification token and other payment card information such as the payment card's account number, the mobile device can be used to conduct payment transactions like the payment card. For example, in a subsequent purchase transaction, the mobile device can be used at the access device <b>34</b> or some other access device at the same or different merchant (step <b>212</b>). The mobile device can have a contactless element (as described above), which can then pass the token and other payment credentials (e.g., the account number) to the access device <b>34</b> (step <b>214</b>).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The access device <b>34</b> can then send a second authorization request message with the token to the payment processing network <b>26</b> (step <b>216</b>). Also, the mobile device identifier (e.g., mobile phone number), a purchase price, and purchase details (e.g., the products purchased&#x2014;SKU numbers) for the transaction may also be present in the authorization request message. The payment processing network <b>26</b> then analyzes the authorization request message to determine the presence of the token (step <b>220</b>). If the verification token is present, then &#x201c;card present&#x201d; processing is performed (step <b>222</b>), as opposed to &#x201c;card not present&#x201d; processing. The payment processing network <b>220</b> can perform processing as if the card was present. The merchant <b>22</b> may obtain lower fees (e.g., interchange rate) and may also get chargeback protection. Such benefits would not be present in card not present type of transaction.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, the authorization request message is sent to the issuer <b>28</b> (step <b>224</b>) and the issuer decides whether or not to approve the authorization request message. After it decides, it sends an authorization response message back to the access device <b>34</b> via the payment processing network <b>34</b> and the acquirer <b>24</b> (step <b>226</b>).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">At the end of the day, a normal clearing and settlement process can be conducted by the transaction processing system <b>26</b>. A clearing process is a process of exchanging financial details between and acquirer and an issuer to facilitate posting to a consumer's account and reconciliation of the consumer's settlement position. Clearing and settlement can occur simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Other methods according to embodiments of the invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>22</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Enrollment</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary method of enrolling a mobile device in a program that provides the mobile device with the ability to conduct card-present transactions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> (Steps S<b>1</b>-S<b>13</b>) generally describe the process of initially binding a mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> of a consumer <b>30</b> and an account of the consumer <b>30</b> together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (Steps S<b>14</b>-S<b>24</b>) generally describe the subsequent process of binding the characteristics of the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> and the account together.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In step S<b>1</b>, the consumer <b>30</b> may acquire a mobile device <b>32</b>, such as a mobile phone (e.g., an iPhone&#x2122;). The consumer <b>30</b>, may visit a merchant host site (e.g., iTunes&#x2122;), which may be a website, as shown in step S<b>2</b>, to create an account with the merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) (e.g., an iTunes&#x2122; account). During the account creation process, the consumer <b>30</b> may provide payment information (e.g., a payment card number), a username, a password, security questions to retrieve merchant website account information, and other information to the merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>). Other merchant website account information may include contact information (e.g., email address, home address, mobile phone number) and settings (e.g., notification preferences).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a user interface <b>1600</b> that can be associated with steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> (described below). The user interface <b>1600</b> may comprise an area to provide consumer information such as a username input region <b>1602</b>, a password input region <b>1604</b>, and a phone number input region <b>1614</b>. The user interface <b>1600</b> may also comprise a payment information area comprising a name input region <b>1606</b>, a payment card number input region <b>1608</b>, a card verification value input region <b>1610</b>, and a billing address input region <b>1612</b>. A selection box <b>1616</b> may also be provided to allow the consumer <b>30</b> to confirm enrollment in the program.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In step S<b>3</b>, the merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) may ask the consumer <b>30</b> whether the consumer would like to use the merchant website account at a merchant access device <b>34</b> at a merchant location. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the box <b>1616</b> may be selected by the consumer <b>30</b>. When the consumer <b>30</b> accepts in step S<b>4</b>, the merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) electronically transmits a request to the merchant server <b>22</b> for a retail application download to the consumer's mobile device <b>32</b>, as shown in step S<b>5</b>. For example, the request may be electronically transmitted from the merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>), displayed to the consumer <b>30</b>, to the merchant server <b>22</b> using a transport layer security protocol similar to Open SSL. The merchant website <b>22</b>(<i>a</i>) may use a secure http session for securely logging and transmitting the consumer <b>30</b> information to prevent eavesdropping and tampering of the consumer <b>30</b> information.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In step S<b>6</b>, the merchant server <b>22</b> electronically transmits a registration request to a transaction gateway <b>23</b>. The registration request may include any suitable information including any suitable combination of the following: a PAN (Primary Account Number) associated with a portable consumer device (e.g., payment card), a ZIP code, a mobile device identifier (e.g., mobile phone number or phone number alias), an electronic serial number (ESN), an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a digital certificate, an application identifier, and merchant website account information (e.g., username, password, security questions).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In step S<b>7</b>, the transaction gateway <b>23</b> may create an AVS (account validation service) request and electronically transmits the AVS request to a payment processing network <b>26</b> (e.g., VisaNet). The AVS request may include data from the registration request, such as the mobile device identifier, PAN, and merchant website account information.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step S<b>8</b>, the payment processing network <b>26</b> validates the account. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the registration module <b>701</b> of the computer readable medium <b>26</b>(<i>d</i>) of the payment processing network <b>26</b> may perform the account validation, including associating the mobile device identifier, payment card, PAN, and other information with the account. The mobile device identifier may be stored in a mobile device identifier database <b>26</b>(<i>b</i>). The payment card, or other portable consumer device, may be stored in a portable consumer device database <b>26</b>(<i>a</i>). When the mobile device identifier has been associated with the PAN, the payment processing network <b>26</b> may generate an activation code for the retail application for the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The activation code may be generated by any suitable algorithm or a random generator. The activation code may be in any suitable form including, but not limited to, a sequence of letters, numbers, or a combination of both. It may also have a predetermined length. In some embodiments of the invention, the activation code may be a two part activation code, with a first part and a second part used for verification. For example, the activation code may be a 16-digit number, where the first part of the activation code may be the first 8 digits, and the second part of the activation code may be the latter 8 digits.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in step S<b>9</b>, the first part of the activation code may be electronically transmitted to the merchant server <b>22</b>. The second part of the activation code may be retained at the payment processing network <b>26</b> or transaction gateway <b>23</b>. To verify during a purchase transaction, the first part of the activation code (e.g., first 8 digits) will be matched with the second part of the activation code (e.g., latter 8 digits) to result in the complete, original activation code (e.g., 16 digits).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In embodiments of the invention, the first part of the activation code can form part or all of a verification token, which can be used to allow the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to be used as a device which can be used as a card present type of device.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment of the invention, the payment processing network <b>26</b> may retain a hash (SHA1, SHA-256, MD5, etc.) of the activation code along with the second part of the activation code. The first part of the activation code may be discarded by the payment processing network <b>26</b> after electronically transmitting it to the merchant server <b>22</b>. During a purchase transaction, the first part of the activation code (provided by the mobile device <b>32</b>) and the second part of the activation code (provided by the payment processing network <b>26</b>) are concatenated and hashed. Before granting authorization, the payment processing network may compare the newly generated hash of the concatenated activation code against the stored hash of the original activation code on the payment processing network <b>26</b>. The bifurcation of the activation code and separate storage of the two parts of the activation code requires authentication from both the consumer and the payment processing network <b>26</b> before the transaction can be authorized, adding an additional layer of security. Furthermore, storage of the two parts of the activation codes in separate geographic locations (first part on the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>, and second part on the payment processing network <b>26</b>) enables better security, since the transactions may only be authorized when the two parts of the activation code exist together.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In step S<b>10</b>, the merchant server <b>22</b> prepares the retail application for download, including the first part of the activation code from the transaction gateway <b>23</b>. The merchant server <b>22</b> may sign a consumer digital certificate including a unique identifier for the consumer (e.g., consumer account number, consumer phone number, serial number, etc.) and the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., UDID). The consumer digital certificate is then electronically transmitted to the consumer's mobile device <b>32</b>, where it may be stored on a memory on the mobile device <b>32</b>, including the public key. Additionally, a digital certificate may be issued by a certificate authority (e.g., VeriSign&#x2122;) and may include a public key associated with the merchant <b>22</b> that is also transmitted to the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>. The digital certificate from the certificate authority allows the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> to attest the identity of the merchant server <b>22</b> signing the consumer digital certificate.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In step S<b>11</b>, the consumer <b>30</b> downloads the retail application to the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>. The retail application may be customized for different mobile devices and operating systems. The download may also include the first part of the activation code from the transaction gateway <b>23</b>. The digital certificate signed by the merchant server <b>22</b> may also be included in the download of the retail application to verify the identity of the merchant server <b>22</b>. The mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> may authenticate the download before installing the application and the digital certificate on the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>. The mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> may have access to the public key of the merchant server <b>22</b> through a digital certificate issued by the certificate authority (e.g., VeriSign). The mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> may authenticate that the digital certificate is signed by the merchant server <b>22</b> by using the public key attributed to the merchant server <b>22</b>. The mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> may also match the unique identifier for the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> in the digital certificate against the mobile device's <b>32</b> unique identifier stored internally. Once the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b> authenticates the digital certificate and verifies that the digital certificate was issued for that particular device, the application, digital certificate and any associated data may be installed on the mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In step S<b>12</b>, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, after the download is complete, a message <b>1804</b> may be displayed on an interface <b>1800</b> on the consumer's mobile device <b>32</b>-<b>1</b>.

For example, mobile device manufacturers do not need to modify their mobile devices with special security or near-field communication chips, merchants do not need to modify their access devices, and other existing infrastructure elements do not need to be changed in a significant manner in order to obtain card present types of transactions for devices that would not traditional satisfy card present types of transaction standards.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Embodiments of the invention allow payments to be made with a mobile device (e.g., a phone) as a &#x201c;card present&#x201d; type of transaction, even though the mobile device does not have the type of chip that would normally be required for a card present transaction. The consumer may use the mobile device and does not need to present a portable consumer device (e.g., payment card) normally required to conduct the &#x201c;card present&#x201d; type of transaction, reducing the number of items or devices the consumer needs to carry. Although the payment card is not present, embodiments of the invention allow the transaction to be processed as a &#x201c;card present&#x201d; transaction, eliminating fees or interchange rates often associated with &#x201c;card not present&#x201d; transactions.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Additionally, it would be advantageous to combine the convenience of conducting transactions using a mobile device with the security of in-person transactions. Furthermore, possessing multiple portable consumer devices (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards) to conduct both in-person transactions and online transactions can be cumbersome. It can be difficult for the consumer to keep track of all the different portable consumer devices and may forget to bring a specific portable consumer device for a specific transaction, such as using a merchant-specific credit card at an associated merchant. Having multiple portable consumer devices also makes them prone to loss or theft. Therefore improved and simplified systems and methods of conducting payment transactions online and in-person are needed. Improved security, and prevent loss or theft of confidential data.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, the merchant may also operate a Website that has an account that is associated with the mobile device, and that requires a password for access. This password can also be used to access a verification token when enrollment of the phone with the payment processing network can takes place at the access device.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Also, in other embodiments, the enrollment of the consumer's mobile device can alternatively take place after a consumer swipes his portable consumer device (e.g., payment card) in an actual transaction. That is, for example, after a payment card is swiped in a transaction, the consumer may be asked to enroll in a particular program and enter a mobile device identifier (e.g., phone number). Thus, in this case, only one payment card swipe can be used to make a purchase and start the enrollment process.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In other embodiments, after the payment processing network has verified the consumer's data (e.g., phone number, e-mail address, etc.), a dynamic or static authentication code can be sent to the user's phone. This code can then be passed from the consumer's phone to the access device (e.g., via an RF link, via keyboard entry, or via some other communication link) in the payment process, and this code can be sent in the authorization request message back to the payment processing network. This is yet another way to authenticate the consumer. This can show the payment processing network that this transaction is authentic and the transaction may be eligible for a lower interchange rate.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">From the foregoing description, embodiments of the invention can provide customer registration and activation for a card present processing program. It can provide the merchant with services for registration of the consumer to participate in the card present program including in-store consumer registration, capture of consumer factors of identification (e.g., PAN, email, legal name, phone IMIS, MSIDN, etc.), invocation of &#x201c;qualification evaluation&#x201d; to confirm the consumer is qualified for the card present processing program, real-time &#x201c;instant&#x201d; activation of qualified consumers for the &#x2018;CP&#x2019; program, and reporting and analytics on consumer registration and activation metrics. It can also provide card present processing of online transactions for consumers qualifying for the card present processing program, as well as transactions for consumers enrolled in the card present processing program via the merchant's online store (e.g., iTunes&#x2122;) will be handled as card present transactions. It may also provide tokenization of consumer transactions, and tokenization of one or more of a i) Transaction ID (TID), ii) Account Number (PAN), iii) Merchant ID (MID), iv) store ID, and v.) Product Identifier.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Embodiments of the invention may also provide standards and regulatory compliance. Embodiments of the invention may provide secure storage of PAN and transaction data while providing the merchant with a secure token so that the merchant can access data for analytics without compromising personal private information or account number information. Embodiments of the invention may also provide for multi-factor tokenization to enable consumer analytics across payment products, stores, and geographies. Embodiments of the invention may also be used to manage dispute resolution (approach for managing disputes, such as charge backs and refunds, as card present transactions for electronic music purchases).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">A recitation of &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;the&#x201d; is intended to mean &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; unless specifically indicated to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Embodiments of the invention are not limited to the above-described embodiments.
