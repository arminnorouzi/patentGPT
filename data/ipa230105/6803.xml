The network discovery operation may include a scanning operation of the STA. That is, to access a network, the STA needs to discover a participating network. The STA needs to identify a compatible network before participating in a wireless network, and a process of identifying a network present in a particular area is referred to as scanning. Scanning methods include active scanning and passive scanning.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a network discovery operation including an active scanning process. In active scanning, a STA performing scanning transmits a probe request frame and waits for a response to the probe request frame in order to identify which AP is present around while moving to channels. A responder transmits a probe response frame as a response to the probe request frame to the STA having transmitted the probe request frame. Here, the responder may be a STA that transmits the last beacon frame in a BSS of a channel being scanned. In the BSS, since an AP transmits a beacon frame, the AP is the responder. In an IBSS, since STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns, the responder is not fixed. For example, when the STA transmits a probe request frame via channel 1 and receives a probe response frame via channel 1, the STA may store BSS-related information included in the received probe response frame, may move to the next channel (e.g., channel 2), and may perform scanning (e.g., transmits a probe request and receives a probe response via channel 2) by the same method.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, scanning may be performed by a passive scanning method. In passive scanning, a STA performing scanning may wait for a beacon frame while moving to channels. A beacon frame is one of management frames in IEEE 802.11 and is periodically transmitted to indicate the presence of a wireless network and to enable the STA performing scanning to find the wireless network and to participate in the wireless network. In a BSS, an AP serves to periodically transmit a beacon frame. In an IBSS, STAs in the IBSS transmit a beacon frame in turns. Upon receiving the beacon frame, the STA performing scanning stores information related to a BSS included in the beacon frame and records beacon frame information in each channel while moving to another channel. The STA having received the beacon frame may store BSS-related information included in the received beacon frame, may move to the next channel, and may perform scanning in the next channel by the same method.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">After discovering the network, the STA may perform an authentication process in S<b>320</b>.

The authentication process in S<b>320</b> may include a process in which the STA transmits an authentication request frame to the AP and the AP transmits an authentication response frame to the STA in response. The authentication frames used for an authentication request/response are management frames.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The authentication frames may include information related to an authentication algorithm number, an authentication transaction sequence number, a status code, a challenge text, a robust security network (RSN), and a finite cyclic group.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The STA may transmit the authentication request frame to the AP.

The association response frame may include, for example, information related to various capabilities, a status code, an association ID (AID), a supported rate, an enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameter set, a received channel power indicator (RCPI), a received signal-to-noise indicator (RSNI), a mobility domain, a timeout interval (association comeback time), an overlapping BSS scanning parameter, a TIM broadcast response, and a QoS map.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In D<b>340</b>, the STA may perform a security setup process.

The transmitting STA may perform convolutional encoding (i.e., BCC encoding) based on a rate of R=1/2 to generate 52-coded bits, and may perform interleaving on the 52-coded bits. The transmitting STA may perform BPSK modulation on the interleaved 52-coded bits to generate 52 BPSK symbols to be allocated to each U-SIG symbol. One U-SIG symbol may be transmitted based on 65 tones (subcarriers) from a subcarrier index &#x2212;28 to a subcarrier index +28, except for a DC index 0. The 52 BPSK symbols generated by the transmitting STA may be transmitted based on the remaining tones (subcarriers) except for pilot tones, i.e., tones &#x2212;21, &#x2212;7, +7, +21.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0198">For example, the A-bit information (e.g., 52 un-coded bits) generated by the U-SIG may include a CRC field (e.g., a field having a length of 4 bits) and a tail field (e.g., a field having a length of 6 bits). The CRC field and the tail field may be transmitted through the second symbol of the U-SIG. The CRC field may be generated based on 26 bits allocated to the first symbol of the U-SIG and the remaining 16 bits except for the CRC/tail fields in the second symbol, and may be generated based on the conventional CRC calculation algorithm. In addition, the tail field may be used to terminate trellis of a convolutional decoder, and may be set to, for example, &#x201c;000000&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0199">The A-bit information (e.g., 52 un-coded bits) transmitted by the U-SIG (or U-SIG field) may be divided into version-independent bits and version-dependent bits. For example, the version-independent bits may have a fixed or variable size. For example, the version-independent bits may be allocated only to the first symbol of the U-SIG, or the version-independent bits may be allocated to both of the first and second symbols of the U-SIG. For example, the version-independent bits and the version-dependent bits may be called in various terms such as a first control bit, a second control bit, or the like.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0200">For example, the version-independent bits of the U-SIG may include a PHY version identifier of 3 bits. For example, the PHY version identifier of 3 bits may include information related to a PHY version of a TX/RX PPDU. For example, a first value of the PHY version identifier of 3 bits may indicate that the TX/RX PPDU is an EHT PPDU. In other words, when the transmitting STA transmits the EHT PPDU, the PHY version identifier of 3 bits may be set to a first value. In other words, the receiving STA may determine that the RX PPDU is the EHT PPDU, based on the PHY version identifier having the first value.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0201">For example, the version-independent bits of the U-SIG may include a UL/DL flag field of 1 bit. A first value of the UL/DL flag field of 1 bit relates to UL communication, and a second value of the UL/DL flag field relates to DL communication.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0202">For example, the version-independent bits of the U-SIG may include information related to a TXOP length and information related to a BSS color ID.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0203">For example, when the EHT PPDU is divided into various types (e.g., various types such as an EHT PPDU related to an SU mode, an EHT PPDU related to an MU mode, an EHT PPDU related to a TB mode, an EHT PPDU related to extended range transmission, or the like), information related to the type of the EHT PPDU may be included in the version-dependent bits of the U-SIG.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0204">For example, the U-SIG may include: 1) a bandwidth field including information related to a bandwidth; 2) a field including information related to an MCS scheme applied to EHT-SIG; 3) an indication field including information regarding whether a dual subcarrier modulation (DCM) scheme is applied to EHT-SIG; 4) a field including information related to the number of symbol used for EHT-SIG; 5) a field including information regarding whether the EHT-SIG is generated across a full band; 6) a field including information related to a type of EHT-LTF/STF; and 7) information related to a field indicating an EHT-LTF length and a CP length.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0205">Preamble puncturing may be applied to the PPDU of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The preamble puncturing implies that puncturing is applied to part (e.g., a secondary 20 MHz band) of the full band. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is transmitted, an STA may apply puncturing to the secondary 20 MHz band out of the 80 MHz band, and may transmit a PPDU only through a primary 20 MHz band and a secondary 40 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0206">For example, a pattern of the preamble puncturing may be configured in advance. For example, when a first puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied only to the secondary 20 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a second puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only any one of two secondary 20 MHz bands included in the secondary 40 MHz band within the 80 MHz band. For example, when a third puncturing pattern is applied, puncturing may be applied to only the secondary 20 MHz band included in the primary 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band). For example, when a fourth puncturing is applied, puncturing may be applied to at least one 20 MHz channel not belonging to a primary 40 MHz band in the presence of the primary 40 MHz band included in the 80 MHz band within the 160 MHz band (or 80+80 MHz band).</p><p id="p-0212" num="0207">Information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU may be included in U-SIG and/or EHT-SIG. For example, a first field of the U-SIG may include information related to a contiguous bandwidth, and second field of the U-SIG may include information related to the preamble puncturing applied to the PPDU.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0208">For example, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. When a bandwidth of the PPDU exceeds 80 MHz, the U-SIG may be configured individually in unit of 80 MHz. For example, when the bandwidth of the PPDU is 160 MHz, the PPDU may include a first U-SIG for a first 80 MHz band and a second U-SIG for a second 80 MHz band. In this case, a first field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band. In addition, a first field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a 160 MHz bandwidth, and a second field of the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the second 80 MHz band. Meanwhile, an EHT-SIG contiguous to the first U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing applied to the second 80 MHz band (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern), and an EHT-SIG contiguous to the second U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) applied to the first 80 MHz band.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0209">Additionally or alternatively, the U-SIG and the EHT-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing, based on the following method. The U-SIG may include information related to a preamble puncturing (i.e., information related to a preamble puncturing pattern) for all bands. That is, the EHT-SIG may not include the information related to the preamble puncturing, and only the U-SIG may include the information related to the preamble puncturing (i.e., the information related to the preamble puncturing pattern).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0210">The U-SIG may be configured in unit of 20 MHz. For example, when an 80 MHz PPDU is configured, the U-SIG may be duplicated. That is, four identical U-SIGs may be included in the 80 MHz PPDU.

common field of the EHT-SIG is omitted may be supported. The mode in the common field of the EHT-SIG is omitted may be called a compressed mode. When the compressed mode is used, a plurality of users (i.e., a plurality of receiving STAs) may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on non-OFDMA. That is, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU) received through the same frequency band. Meanwhile, when a non-compressed mode is used, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may decode the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU), based on OFDMA. That is, the plurality of users of the EHT PPDU may receive the PPDU (e.g., the data field of the PPDU) through different frequency bands.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0221">The EHT-SIG may be configured based on various MCS schemes. As described above, information related to an MCS scheme applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in U-SIG. The EHT-SIG may be configured based on a DCM scheme. For example, among N data tones (e.g., 52 data tones) allocated for the EHT-SIG, a first modulation scheme may be applied to half of consecutive tones, and a second modulation scheme may be applied to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. That is, a transmitting STA may use the first modulation scheme to modulate specific control information through a first symbol and allocate it to half of the consecutive tones, and may use the second modulation scheme to modulate the same control information by using a second symbol and allocate it to the remaining half of the consecutive tones. As described above, information (e.g., a 1-bit field) regarding whether the DCM scheme is applied to the EHT-SIG may be included in the U-SIG. An HE-STF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> may be used for improving automatic gain control estimation in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) environment or an OFDMA environment.

For example, a first type of STF (e.g., 1&#xd7;STF) may be generated based on a first type STF sequence in which a non-zero coefficient is arranged with an interval of 16 subcarriers. An STF signal generated based on the first type STF sequence may have a period of 0.8 &#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 0.8 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a first type STF having a length of 4 &#x3bc;s. For example, a second type of STF (e.g., 2&#xd7;STF) may be generated based on a second type STF sequence in which a non-zero coefficient is arranged with an interval of 8 subcarriers. An STF signal generated based on the second type STF sequence may have a period of 1.6 &#x3bc;s, and a periodicity signal of 1.6 &#x3bc;s may be repeated 5 times to become a second type STF having a length of 8 &#x3bc;s.

For example, the equation 2 below may represent a sequence defined as 16 tone intervals from a tone index &#x2212;112 to a tone index 112. Since a subcarrier spacing of 78.125 kHz is applied to the EHT-STR, the 16 tone intervals may imply that an EHT-STF coefficient (or element) is arranged with an interval of 78.125*16=1250 kHz.

Tone Plan in 802.11ax WLAN System</p><p id="p-0280" num="0254">In the present specification, a tone plan relates to a rule for determining a size of a resource unit (RU) and/or a location of the RU. Hereinafter, a PPDU based on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, that is, a tone plan applied to an HE PPDU, will be described. In other words, hereinafter, the RU size and RU location applied to the HE PPDU are described, and control information related to the RU applied to the HE PPDU is described.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0255">In the present specification, control information related to an RU (or control information related to a tone plan) may include a size and location of the RU, information of a user STA allocated to a specific RU, a frequency bandwidth for a PPDU in which the RU is included, and/or control information on a modulation scheme applied to the specific RU. The control information related to the RU may be included in a SIG field. For example, in the IEEE 802.11ax standard, the control information related to the RU is included in an HE-SIG-B field. That is, in a process of generating a TX PPDU, a transmitting STA may allow the control information on the RU included in the PPDU to be included in the HE-SIG-B field. In addition, a receiving STA may receive an HE-SIG-B included in an RX PPDU and obtain control information included in the HE-SIG-B, so as to determine whether there is an RU allocated to the receiving STA and decode the allocated RU, based on the HE-SIG-B.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0256">In the IEEE 802.11ax standard, HE-STF, HE-LTF, and data fields may be configured in unit of RUs. That is, when a first RU for a first receiving STA is configured, STF/LTF/data fields for the first receiving STA may be transmitted/received through the first RU.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0257">In the IEEE 802.11ax standard, a PPDU (i.e., SU PPDU) for one receiving STA and a PPDU (i.e., MU PPDU) for a plurality of receiving STAs are separately defined, and respective tone plans are separately defined. Specific details will be described below.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0258">The RU defined in 11ax may include a plurality of subcarriers. For example, when the RU includes N subcarriers, it may be expressed by an N-tone RU or N RUs. A location of a specific RU may be expressed by a subcarrier index. The subcarrier index may be defined in unit of a subcarrier frequency spacing. In the 11ax standard, the subcarrier frequency spacing is 312.5 kHz or 78.125 kHz, and the subcarrier frequency spacing for the RU is 78.125 kHz. That is, a subcarrier index+1 for the RU may mean a location which is more increased by 78.125 kHz than a DC tone, and a subcarrier index &#x2212;1 for the RU may mean a location which is more decreased by 78.125 kHz than the DC tone. For example, when the location of the specific RU is expressed by [&#x2212;121:&#x2212;96], the RU may be located in a region from a subcarrier index &#x2212;121 to a subcarrier index &#x2212;96. As a result, the RU may include 26 subcarriers.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0259">The N-tone RU may include a pre-set pilot tone.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0260">2.

Embodiment Applicable to the Present Disclosure</p><p id="p-0345" num="0361">In the wireless LAN 802.11 system, to increase peak throughput, it is considered to use a wider band than the existing 11ax or to transmit an increased stream by using more antennas. In addition, the present specification also considers a method of aggregating multiple links or aggregating multiple RUs and allocating them to one STA for transmission.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0362">In this specification, a method of allocating and transmitting multiple RUs to one STA is considered, and in this case, a method of aggregating RUs in various bandwidths is proposed. In particular, the present specification focuses on and proposes a method of aggregating large-RU in non-OFDMA transmission.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0363">In the existing 802.11ax, preamble puncturing was not considered during non-OFDMA transmission. Therefore, non-OFDMA transmission was only possible using the entire bandwidth of 20/40/80/160/160+160 MHz, and the RU used at this time was It is as below.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0364">242/484/996/2&#xd7;996 RU</p><p id="p-0349" num="0365">The above RUs will be called large RUs.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0366">In 802.11be, preamble puncturing was introduced in non-OFDMA transmission to improve efficiency. This may be 20 MHz-based puncturing like preamble puncturing in OFDMA of 802.11ax. In this situation, non-OFDMA transmission can be performed by combining multiple large RUs. In this specification, various large RU combinations in non-OFDMA transmission will be proposed in each bandwidth situation as follows. However, consider the situation where the preamble puncturing portion does not exceed 50% of the total bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0367">In addition, in order to minimize interference during preamble puncturing in each 80 MHz subchannel of various bandwidths, the tone plan of an adjacent 20 MHz channel may be replaced with a 20 MHz tone plan, or a tone plan in which only the 20 MHz portion of the 80 MHz tone plan is partially shifted may be used. Of course, without changing the tone plan of the adjacent 20 MHz channel by using hardware/filter that can effectively control interference, the original 80 MHz tone plan can be used as it is, and data can be transmitted using the remaining channels except for the preamble-punctured 20 MHz.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0368">Alternatively, the tone plan is used as it is, but when an adjacent channel of a preamble punctured 20 MHz channel uses a 242-tone RU, the 242-tone RU method of 802.11ax is applied as it is for encoding. Instead, during transmission, some tones adjacent to the punctured channel among 242-tone RUs may be transmitted by forcibly puncturing or reducing power. Here, the adjacent 20 MHz channel means 20 MHz channels other than the preamble punctured 20 MHz channels in each 40 MHz subchannel when each 80 MHz subchannel is divided into lower 40 MHz and higher 40 MHz.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0369">In addition, in lower 40 MHz or higher 40 MHz where preamble puncturing is not performed, 484-tone RU (484-tone RU in the corresponding 40 MHz in the 80 MHz tone plan) can be used for data transmission. 242-tone RUs (242-tone RUs in the 20 MHz in the 80 MHz tone plan or 242-tone RUs in the 20 MHz in the changed tone plan to reduce interference) can be used for data transmission in the 20 MHz adjacent 20 MHz preamble punctured.
