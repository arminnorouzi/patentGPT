The invention further relates to methods of treating a subject having cancer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fibrosis, the accumulation of undesirable and harmful scar tissue, occurs in multiple tissues and organs and causes a variety of disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrothorax, renal fibrosis, radiation-induced lung injury following treatment for cancer, bridging fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis such as interstitial fibrosis or replacement fibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, myelofibrosis, Peyronie's disease, keloid scar, arthrofibrosis, chronic kidney disease, adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder, arthrofibrosis, and systemic sclerosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common form of pulmonary fibrosis, affects approximately 130,000 individuals in the United States alone and approximately 5,000,000 individuals globally. Current therapies for treating fibrosis disorders are limited and cause severe side effects such as severe adverse gastrointestinal events. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for improved therapies for treating fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cancer, a group of diseases caused by the harmful, abnormal, uncontrolled, and undesirable growth of cells, occurs in multiple tissues and organs, including the breasts, the lungs, the bladder, the colon, the rectum, the uterus, the testes, the kidneys, the blood, the lymphatic system, the liver, the bile ducts, the skin, the pancreas, the prostate, the thyroid gland, the brain, and the stomach. Globally, approximately 10,000,000 individuals die of cancer per year. Current therapies for treating cancer cause severe side effects such as severe adverse gastrointestinal events. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for improved therapies for treating cancer.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides enteric coated solid dosage forms of N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide (&#x201c;compound 1&#x201d;), or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, and methods of treating fibrosis, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, by administering an effective amount of compound 1 to a patient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first embodiment, the invention features solid dosage forms of compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

The pH of this region is approximately 1 to 3. The enteric coating component allows the medicament core to remain substantially intact and thus prevents the pharmacologically active substance from being released in this region or the acid from penetrating through the tablet core. The tablets then pass through the small intestine wherein the majority of the enteric coating component will dissolve and release the pharmacologically active substance therein. In normal flow direction, the small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum, and ilieum. The pH of these regions is approximately 5 to approximately 7.2.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein &#x201c;enteric coating&#x201d; is a polymer material or materials which encase the medicament core (e.g., one containing N1-pyrrolidine-N5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide, (compound 1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) as they pass through the stomach. A suitable pH-sensitive polymer is one which will dissolve in the intestinal juices at the higher pH levels (pH greater than 4.5), such as within the small intestine and therefor permit release of the pharmacologically active substance in the regions of the small intestine and not in the upper portion of the GI tract, such as the stomach. Enteric coatings also protect the stomach from irritating pharmaceutical ingredients. Enteric coatings can be applied to a variety of formulations, including tablets, capsules, and microparticles. The enteric coating may be applied directly to the medicament core and may be an integral part of the tablet, capsule, or microparticle. Alternatively, the enteric coating may be separate from the medicament core where the coating, while encapsulating the medicament core, is not attached to the medicament core.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, &#x201c;delayed release&#x201d; means a pharmaceutical preparation, e.g., an orally administered formulation, which passes through the acidic environment of the stomach substantially intact and dissolves in the more basic environment of the small intestine. In some embodiments, delayed release of the active agent (e.g., N1-pyrrolidine-N5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide (compound 1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) results from the use of a pH-sensitive enteric coating of an oral dosage form.

However, the administration of previously-known dosage forms of biguanide compounds can have disadvantages including side effects such as adverse gastrointestinal events. For these reasons, there is a need for a biguanide-based substance effective at treating fibrosis or cancer that is formulated in a manner that minimizes side effects such as adverse gastrointestinal events.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present inventors have found that administering biguanide substance N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide formulated in a solid dosage form for oral administration containing an enteric coating results in fewer adverse gastrointestinal events relative to administering N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide in standard tablet form. Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a formulation of N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide that causes fewer undesirable side effects than other formulations of N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Compound 1, N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide, is a functionalized biguanide that is useful in treating fibrosis or cancer. The present inventors have discovered that formulating compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a solid dosage form for oral administration containing an enteric coating results in surprisingly high plasma concentration of compound 1 4-8 hours after administration to a subject, as well as surprisingly fewer adverse gastrointestinal events upon administration to a subject relative to the administration of compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in standard tablet form. Accordingly, the present invention features solid dosage forms compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, containing an enteric coating, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods for the treatment of fibrosis in a subject by administering the formulation of compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solid Dosage Forms for Oral Administration</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pharmaceutical compositions contemplated by the invention include those formulated for oral administration (&#x201c;oral dosage forms&#x201d;). Oral dosage forms can be, for example, in the form of tablets, capsules, a liquid solution or suspension, a powder, or liquid or solid crystals, which contain the active ingredient(s) in a mixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. These compositions can be prepared in a variety of ways well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be made so as to release compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in specific segments of the gastrointestinal tract at controlled times by a variety of excipients and formulation technologies. For example, formulations may be tailored to address a specific disease, to achieve plasma levels of compound 1 required to achieve therapeutic efficacy, to enable a desired duration of drug effect, and to provide a set of compositions with varying drug release.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The pharmaceutical compositions contemplated by the invention may include compound 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a mixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are known to the skilled artisan. Excipients may be, for example, inert diluents or fillers such as sucrose, sorbitol, sugar, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, in particular microcrystalline cellulose PH101 or microcrystalline cellulose PH200, starches including potato starch, calcium carbonate, sodium chloride, lactose, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, or sodium phosphate; disintegrants such as crospovidone, sodium alginate, colloidal magnesiumaluminum silicate, calcium silicate, sodium starch glycolate, acrylic acid derivatives, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, modified cellulose gum, cross-linked povidone, alginic acid and alginates, pregelatinised starch, modified corn starch cellulose derivatives including microcrystalline cellulose, starches including potato starch, croscarmellose sodium, alginates, or alginic acid; binders such as sucrose, glucose, sorbitol, acacia, alginic acid, gelatin, starch, pregelatinized starch, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose EXF, ethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or polyethylene glycol; lubricants and/or glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide, particularly colloidal silicon dioxide Cab-O-Sil&#xae; MSP, glycerol tribehenate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, talc, sodium stearyl fumarate, sodium behenate, stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, polyoxyethylene glycol, leucine, sodium benzoate, stearates, polyethylene glycol, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl palmitostearate, liquid paraffin, poloxamer, sodium lauryl sulphate, magnesium lauryl sulphate, hydrogenated castor colloidal silicon dioxide, palmitostearate, stearic acid, zinc stearate, stearyl alcohol, silicas, or hydrogenated vegetable oil; anti-caking agents such as colloidal silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, tricalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium ferrocyanide, potassium ferrocyanide, calcium ferrocyanide, calcium phosphate, sodium silicate, colloidal silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, magnesium trisilicate, talcum powder, sodium aluminosilicate, potassium aluminum silicate, calcium aluminosilicate, bentonite, aluminum silicate, stearic acid, polydimethylsiloxane. Other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be colorants, flavoring agents, plasticizers, humectants, and buffering agents.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Suitable pharmaceutical carriers, as well as pharmaceutical necessities for use in pharmaceutical formulations, are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Gennaro, Ed., Lippencott Williams &#x26; Wilkins (2005), a well-known reference text in this field, and in the USP/NF (United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary) or corresponding European or Japanese reference documents.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Enteric Coatings</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pharmaceutical compositions formulated for oral delivery of the present invention can be coated to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of delayed or extended release. The coating may be adapted to release the active drug substance in a predetermined pattern (e.g., in order to achieve a controlled release formulation) or it may be adapted not to release the active drug substance until after passage through the stomach, e.g., distal to the stomach, by use of an enteric coating (e.g., polymers that are pH-sensitive (&#x201c;pH controlled release&#x201d;), polymers with a slow or pH-dependent rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion (&#x201c;time-controlled release&#x201d;), polymers that are degraded by enzymes (&#x201c;enzyme-controlled release&#x201d; or &#x201c;biodegradable release&#x201d;) and polymers that form firm layers that are destroyed by an increase in pressure (&#x201c;pressure-controlled release&#x201d;)). Exemplary enteric coatings that can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein include sugar coatings, film coatings (e.g., based on hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, methyl hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, acrylate copolymers, polyethylene glycols and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone), or coatings based on methacrylic acid copolymer, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, shellac, and/or ethylcellulose. Furthermore, a time delay material such as, for example, glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, may be employed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For delayed release formulations, (e.g., those containing an enteric coating) the therapeutic agent of the composition may be targeted for release distal to the stomach (e.g., in the small intestine). The formulation may contain an enteric coating such that the composition is resistant to the low pH environment found in the stomach, but sensitive to the higher pH environment of the small intestine. For example, some pH sensitive pharmaceutical coatings dissolve around pH 5.5, pH 6 or pH 6.5 in the duodenum, while other coatings dissolve around pH 7, which is more typical of the ileum; some types of colon-targeted formulations are composed, in part, of polymers which are refractory to digestion by human (or mammalian) enzymes but can be degraded by enzymes produced by enteric bacteria, thereby effecting release of therapeutic agents co-formulated with said polymers.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, leaky enteric coatings may be used to provide a release profile intermediate between immediate release and delayed release formulations, e.g., those with an enteric coating. For example, U.S. patent application 20080020041 A1 discloses pharmaceutical formulations coated with an enteric material that releases at least a portion of an active ingredient upon contacting gastric fluid, with the remainder released upon contacting intestinal fluid.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Examples of commercial enteric coating technologies include but are not limited to: AcrylEZE, Opadry, Nutrateric and Sureteric products (Colorcon, West Point Pa.), Advantia Performance Specialty Coatings (International Specialty Products, Wayne N.J.), Kollicoat product line (BASF Corporation, Ludwigshafen Germany), Aquacoat products (FMC BioPolymer), Eastman C-A-P (Eastman Chemical Co. Kingsman Tenn.), Eudragit product line (Evonik Industries), and AQOAT, HP-50 and HP-55 product lines (Shin Etsu Pharma). Ashland Specialty Ingredients, Encap Drug Delivery, and Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd. also sell enteric coating systems. Examples of pH sensitive film forming polymers commonly used in enteric coated formulations include: (i) cellulose-based polymers such as cellulose acetate pthalate (e.g. Aquacoat CPD, FMC; C-A-P, Eastman Chemical Co.), cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose pthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellu lose acetate succinate (e.g. AquaSolve, Ashland Specialty Ingredients, Wilmington Del.); (ii) polymethacrylates such as poly(methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate) (e.g. Eudragit L30D-55 and Eudragit L100-55, Evonik Industries; AcrylEZE, Colorcon; Kollicoat MAE 30 DP and Kollicoat MAE 100 P, BASF Pharma Ingredients and Services; Polyquid PA-30, Sanyo Chemical Industries) and poly(methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate) in 1:1 and 1:2 ratios; (iii) polyvinyl derivatives such as poly(vinyl acetate) pthalate (e.g. Sureteric, Colorcon); and (iv) other copolymers such as half esters of the copolymer of styrene and maleic acid, half esters of the copolymer of vinyl ether and maleic acid, and copolymers of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid. Enteric coatings are also made using shellac (e.g., PROTECT, Sensient Pharmaceutical Coating Systems) or sodium alginate and zein (Encap Drug Delivery). Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is also referred to as hypromellose or HPMC.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Multiple techniques for applying enteric coatings to pharmaceutical compositions are known in the art. In one non-limiting example, tablets and/or capsules may undergo a drum coating process in which they are tumbled in a cylindrical drum while being sprayed by a coating solution.

Verapamil and dexamethasone were normally used as internal standards. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) had a minimum signal to noise ratio of 3. A minimum of duplicate QC's at three concentrations (low, mid, and high QC) were incorporated into each run with the low QC no more than 3&#xd7;LLOQ, the mid QC around the middle of the curve, and the high QC should be near the ULOQ (minimally 80% but less than 100% of the value of the highest standard) for the run and the mean value should be within &#xb1;20% of the theoretical value. The results of the QC's provide the basis for accepting or rejecting the run. At least 67% or four of six QC's should be within 20% of their respective nominal values; 33% of the QC's (not replicates of the same concentration) can fall outside 20% of nominal value. The simplest model that adequately describes the concentration-response relationship should be used. Linear or quadratic regression can be used. Weighting was 1/x or 1/x2.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="1">PK Samples Analysis</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Concentrations of Test Article in the plasma samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS method. WinNonlin (Phoenix&#x2122;, version 6.1) or other similar software will be used for pharmacokinetic calculations. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were be calculated, whenever possible from the plasma concentration versus time data: PO administration: T<sub>1/2</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, MRT<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, F%, Number of Points for Regression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The pharmacokinetic data will be described using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation. Additional pharmacokinetic or statistical analysis was performed at the discretion of the contributing scientist.

The dogs were approximately 8 months to 3 years old and weighed approximately 9.0 kg to 13.0 kg at the day of dosing.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Dosing Information</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0081">Animals were dosed with N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide acetate salt as specified in Table 6. Dosages were freshly prepared on the day of dosing. The PO solution was DI water. The enteric capsule was HMPC enteric-coated capsules. The test substance was prepared and used immediately before administration. The preparation method was to weigh N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl biguanide and add sterile distilled water. The mixture was titrated to final volumes by mixing via sonication for 2 minutes and vortexing for 5 minutes. During the administration time, the preparation was handled at room temperature. Animals were fasted overnight prior to dosing and were fed approximately 2 hours after dosing.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="364pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Dosing Information for pharmacokinetic study of N-1-pyrrolidine-N-5-(3-trifluoromethoxy)phenyl</entry></row><row><entry>biguanide via PO administration in Beagle dogs.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Dose</entry><entry>Dose</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>Level</entry><entry>Volume</entry><entry>Conc.</entry><entry>Dog 1</entry><entry>Dog 2</entry><entry>Dog 3</entry><entry>Dog 4</entry><entry>Dog 5</entry><entry>Dog 6</entry></row><row><entry>Day</entry><entry>(mg/kg)</entry><entry>(mL/kg)</entry><entry>(mg/mL)</entry><entry>(male)</entry><entry>(female)</entry><entry>(male)</entry><entry>(female)</entry><entry>(male)</entry><entry>(female)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="10"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="9" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="10" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>0.6</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry><entry>SOLUTION</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>SOLUTION</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>1</entry><entry>10</entry><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry><entry>SOLUTION</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>SOLUTION</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>1</entry><entry>30</entry><entry/><entry>6</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry><entry>SOLUTION</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>SOLUTION</entry><entry>ENTERIC</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>CAPSULE</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="10" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Pharmacokinetic Schedule</heading><p id="p-0089" num="0082">Plasma was sampled from animals pre-dose, and 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours post dose.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Blood Sample Collection and Processing</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0083">Samples were collected via venipuncture of peripheral veins except the dosing vein. 0.3 mL of blood was drawn per time point. The anticoagulant used was potassium EDTA. Whole blood samples were gently inverted several times to ensure anticoagulation then placed on wet ice prior to centrifugation. Within 30 minutes of collection, the samples were centrifuged at approximately 2000&#xd7;g (force) for 10 minutes at 2 to 8&#xb0; C. to obtain plasma. The resultant plasma samples were immediately separated divided into 2 aliquots (&#x2212;75 &#x3bc;L each) and transferred to cryogenic vial.

Verapamil and dexamethasone were normally used as internal standards. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) had a minimum signal to noise ratio of 3. A minimum of duplicate QC's at three concentrations (low, mid, and high QC) were incorporated into each run with the low QC no more than 3&#xd7;LLOQ, the mid QC around the middle of the curve, and the high QC near the ULOQ (minimally 80% but less than 100% of the value of the highest standard) for the run and the mean value within &#xb1;20% of the theoretical value. The results of the QC's provided the basis for accepting or rejecting the run. At least 67% or four of six QC's were within 20% of their respective nominal values; 33% of the QC's (not replicates of the same concentration) fell outside 20% of nominal value. The simplest model that adequately described the concentration-response relationship was used. Linear or quadratic regression was used.

WinNonlin (Phoenix&#x2122;, version 6.1) or other similar software was used for pharmacokinetic calculations. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated, whenever possible from the plasma concentration versus time data: PO administration: T<sub>1/2</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, MRT<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, F%, Number of Points for Regression. The pharmacokinetic data was described using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation. Additional pharmacokinetic or statistical analysis was performed at the discretion of the contributing scientist.

Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 8.1 or higher) using non-compartmental approach based on the route of administration. The following parameters were calculated for groups 1 and 2 whenever possible and as data allowed: C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and AUC. Additional parameters were calculated as appropriate. Descriptive statistics were generated using Phoenix WinNonlin.
