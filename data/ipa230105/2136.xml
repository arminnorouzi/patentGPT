The presently disclosed blow-out plugs are much simpler in construction and operation than currently available pressure relief valves for containers and, thus, the presently disclosed packages are much simpler in construction and operation than currently available pressure-relieved packages.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">With specific reference to the drawing figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a package <b>10</b> including a container <b>12</b> and a pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b>. The pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> is carried by the container <b>12</b> and, upon excess pressure in the interior of the container <b>12</b>, is configured to be displaced to permit gas inside the container <b>12</b> to escape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The illustrated container <b>12</b> is composed of glass, but the container <b>12</b> could be composed of plastic, metal, or any other material suitable for use with pressurized packaging. In any case, the illustrated container <b>12</b> includes a base <b>16</b>, a body <b>18</b> extending away from the base <b>16</b>, a shoulder <b>20</b> extending away from the body <b>18</b>, and a neck <b>22</b> extending away from the shoulder <b>20</b> and terminating in a neck finish <b>24</b> having an open mouth <b>26</b> through which a longitudinal axis A of the container <b>12</b> extends. Although not illustrated, a liquid, for example, a beverage, may be introduced into the container <b>12</b> through the open mouth <b>26</b> and, although not shown, a closure may be coupled to the container <b>12</b> to close and seal the open mouth <b>26</b> so that the package <b>10</b> may be internally pressurized in any suitable manner. In the illustrated embodiment, the pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> is carried in the base <b>16</b> of the container <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, however, the plug <b>14</b> may be carried in the body <b>18</b>, the shoulder <b>20</b>, or even the neck <b>22</b> of the container <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the base <b>16</b> includes a wall <b>28</b> having an interior surface <b>30</b> and an exterior surface <b>32</b>, and a pressure relief passage <b>34</b> extending along a longitudinal passage axis, which, in the illustrated embodiment is the same as the container axis A. In other embodiments, the passage axis may be transversely oriented with respect to the container axis A or parallel to and spaced apart from the container axis A. In any case, the passage <b>34</b> includes a circumferential passage surface <b>36</b> extending through the wall <b>28</b> between the interior and exterior surfaces <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The circumferential passage surface <b>36</b> may be of straight cylindrical shape, as shown in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

Likewise, the base <b>16</b> may be punted such that the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the wall <b>28</b> is spaced upwardly away from the bottom surface established by the heel <b>38</b>. Similarly, the base <b>16</b> may include at least one notch <b>40</b> in the bottom surface established by the heel <b>38</b>. The pressure relief passage <b>34</b> is entirely or partially formed into the wall <b>28</b> of the container <b>12</b> during forming of the container <b>12</b>, and/or may be, for example, hot-worked, drilled, laser ablated, or water cut, into the wall <b>28</b> after forming of the container <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> is configured to be carried in the pressure relief passage <b>34</b> of the container <b>12</b>. The illustrated plug <b>14</b> is a unitary component composed of an elastomeric material, but the plug <b>14</b> also or instead could be composed of a thermoplastic material, and/or any other material(s) suitable for use as a pressure relief blow-out plug for pressurized packaging. In some embodiments, the plug <b>14</b> may be insert molded from a thermoplastic or thermoset core with over molded elastomeric seal portions. In any case, the pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> includes a plug body <b>42</b> carried in the pressure relief passage <b>34</b> and having an inboard end <b>44</b> and an outboard end <b>46</b>. The plug body <b>42</b> further includes a first inboard flange <b>48</b>, a stem <b>52</b>, and a second inboard flange <b>54</b>. The first inboard flange <b>48</b> extends radially outwardly from the inboard end <b>44</b> and has a first outboard sealing surface <b>50</b> that is circumferentially continuous to provide an axial seal against the interior surface <b>30</b> of the wall <b>28</b> of the base <b>16</b> of the container <b>12</b> and surrounding the passage <b>34</b>. The stem <b>52</b> extends longitudinally away from the first inboard flange <b>48</b> and has a maximum outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the pressure relief passage <b>34</b>, and less than the major outer diameters of the flanges <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>. The second inboard flange <b>54</b>, which extends radially away from the stem <b>52</b> and is longitudinally spaced apart from the first inboard flange <b>48</b>, has an outboard facing retention portion <b>56</b> that is circumferentially interrupted to include circumferentially spaced bosses <b>58</b> and vent gaps <b>60</b> between the bosses <b>58</b>. The flanges <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may be umbrella shaped, with outer diameters greater than the inner diameter of the passage <b>34</b>. The plug <b>14</b> may be applied to the container <b>12</b> either by pushing the plug <b>14</b> into the passage <b>34</b> from outside of the container <b>12</b>, or by pushing the plug <b>14</b> into the passage <b>34</b> from inside of the container <b>12</b>, for example, through the open mouth <b>26</b> and down into the passage <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the first inboard flange <b>48</b> is in sealing contact with the interior surface <b>30</b> of the wall <b>28</b> of the container <b>12</b>. But, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, upon excess pressure within the container <b>12</b>, the pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> is configured to be displaced such that the first inboard flange <b>48</b> is pushed through the pressure relief passage <b>34</b> and the second inboard flange <b>54</b> contacts the interior surface <b>30</b> of the wall <b>28</b> of the container <b>12</b> to retain the plug <b>14</b> to the container <b>12</b>. Accordingly, gas inside the container <b>12</b> is permitted to escape between the second inboard flange <b>54</b> and the wall <b>28</b> of the container <b>12</b> via the vent gaps <b>60</b> in the second inboard flange <b>54</b>. Likewise, the notch <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) in the heel <b>38</b> of the base <b>16</b> of the container further <b>12</b> facilitates escape of the gas away from the container <b>12</b>. Also, the plug <b>14</b> may be configured such that a distance between an inboard surface <b>51</b> of the first inboard flange <b>48</b> and an undersurface <b>59</b> of the second inboard flange <b>54</b> is greater than the thickness of the wall <b>28</b> at the pressure relief passage <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The plug <b>14</b> is not ejected through the passage <b>34</b> because the second inboard flange <b>54</b> contacts the interior surface <b>30</b> of the wall <b>28</b> to retain the plug <b>14</b> against the wall <b>28</b> in the container <b>12</b>. In other words, the second inboard flange <b>54</b> provides a physical barrier to prevent the plug <b>14</b> from completely ejecting while still allowing enough of an opening via the passage <b>34</b> to adequately vent pressure in a timely manner. In some embodiments, the plug <b>14</b> may be composed of a material and/or construction that permanently deforms as the plug <b>14</b> is forced through the passage <b>34</b>, rather than being composed and/or constructed in a manner that would allow the plug <b>14</b> to return to shape.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pressure relief blow-out plug <b>14</b> need not include a head extending away from the outboard end <b>46</b> of the plug body <b>42</b> and contacting the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the wall <b>28</b> of the container <b>12</b>. Also, the plug body <b>42</b> may have an outer diameter greater than the inner diameter of the circumferential passage surface <b>36</b> of the pressure relief passage <b>34</b>, such that the plug body <b>42</b> may be interference fit to the pressure relief passage <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the outboard end <b>46</b> of the plug body <b>42</b> is recessed with respect to the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the wall <b>28</b> but, in other embodiments, the outboard end <b>46</b> may extend outwardly of the container <b>12</b> beyond the exterior surface <b>32</b> of the wall <b>28</b>.

These embodiments are similar in many respects to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>7</b></figref> and like numerals among the embodiments generally designate like or corresponding elements throughout the several views of the drawing figures. Accordingly, the descriptions of the embodiments are incorporated into one another, and description of subject matter common to the embodiments generally may not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A first bottle <b>112</b> includes a base <b>116</b> including a wall <b>128</b> having an interior surface <b>130</b> and an exterior surface <b>132</b>, and a pressure relief passage <b>134</b> that extends through the wall <b>128</b> and is tapered. The pressure relief passage <b>134</b> is tapered so that the passage <b>134</b> increases in size (e.g. diameter or maximum width) along an axial direction extending from the interior surface <b>130</b> of the wall <b>128</b> to the exterior surface <b>132</b> of the wall <b>128</b>. The tapered passage <b>134</b> may be provided to facilitate outward displacement of a pressure relief blow-out plug (not shown) relative to the base <b>116</b>, upon excess pressure within the bottle <b>112</b>. More specifically, upon excess pressure within the bottle <b>112</b>, the tapered passage <b>134</b> may permit a body of the plug to progressively relax so that the plug can be more easily ejected from, or displaced with respect to, the wall <b>128</b> of the base <b>116</b>. Even more specifically, the fit between the outer diameter of the plug body and the inner diameter of the tapered pressure relief passage <b>134</b> becomes progressively looser as the plug body moves through the passage <b>134</b>. Accordingly, this configuration may promote quick pressure relief and facilitate consistent performance of plug ejection or displacement, to minimize instances of the plug body becoming stuck or snagged within the base <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A second bottle <b>212</b> includes a base <b>216</b> including a wall <b>228</b> having an interior surface <b>230</b> and an exterior surface <b>232</b>, and a pressure relief passage <b>234</b> that extends through the wall <b>228</b> and is reverse-tapered. The passage <b>234</b> is reverse-tapered so that the passage <b>234</b> decreases in size (e.g. diameter or maximum width) along an axial direction extending from the interior surface <b>230</b> of the wall <b>228</b> to the exterior surface <b>232</b> of the wall <b>228</b>. The reverse-tapered passage <b>234</b> may be provided to impede outward displacement of a pressure relief blow-out plug (not shown) relative to the base <b>216</b>. More specifically, upon excess pressure within the bottle <b>212</b>, the reverse-tapered passage <b>234</b> may serve to progressively constrict a body of the plug so that the plug is not so easily ejected from, or displaced with respect to, the wall <b>228</b> of the base <b>216</b>. Even more specifically, the fit between the outer diameter of the plug body and the inner diameter of the tapered pressure relief passage <b>234</b> becomes progressively tighter as the plug body moves through the passage <b>234</b> and then eventually clears the passage <b>234</b>. Accordingly, this configuration may render the plug more difficult to be removed from the bottle <b>212</b>, and also may promote more consistency in the particular overpressure condition within the bottle <b>212</b> that is desired to displace or eject the plug. The more consistent overpressure condition may be desirable when seeking to avoid plug displacement or ejection when there is a transient spike in overpressure in the bottle <b>212</b> and, instead, promote plug displacement or ejection only during a relatively persistent overpressure condition in the bottle <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The tapers of the tapered and reverse-tapered pressure relief passages <b>134</b>, <b>234</b> include circumferential passage surfaces <b>136</b>, <b>236</b> that may have straight tapers, as in the illustrated embodiments, and that may be provided according to a cone angle between 1 and 20 degrees, including all ranges, sub-ranges, endpoints, and values in that range.
