A non-limiting example of an encapsulation device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It was surprisingly discovered that a system comprising stacked encapsulation devices (e.g., 4 devices) could be implanted and vascularization occurred in between the stacked devices. The system (stacked encapsulation devices) was easily explanted from animals without major bleeding, even with vasculature around and in between the stacked encapsulation devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The vascularization around and in between the system (stacked encapsulation devices) can help the delivery of oxygen and nutrients from the blood supply to the encapsulated cells while enabling the reduction in the required device footprint (the system with the stacked devices would take up less room than having each encapsulation device implanted separately next to each other) and may reduce or eliminate the need for exogenous oxygen delivery (typically, one of ordinary skill in the art would expect that if you are packing cells at a high density, exogenous oxygen delivery would be needed).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention features systems comprising two or more encapsulation devices for cells that are stacked to create a thicker unit, e.g., two devices stacked, three devices stacked, four devices stacked, five devices stacked, six devices stacked, etc. Vascularization occurs within and around the system, which can help the delivery of oxygen and nutrients from the blood supply to the encapsulated cells while enabling the reduction in the required device footprint.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The connecting component does not cover the entire periphery so as to allow vasculature to grow between the devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The systems of the present invention may be used in conjunction with other therapies such as an artificial pancreas (e.g., a glucose sensor and an insulin infusion pump or a combination of the two and a control algorithm, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, cells are not present in the system or device upon implantation. In some embodiments, sensors may detect when oxygen is present in the encapsulation devices (e.g., vascularization has occurred), and cells may be subsequently injected into the device. In some embodiments, a user can determine how much oxygen is present in the system (or device) and determine how many cells to implant based on the oxygen level.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Implantation may be at any appropriate site, including but not limited to an arm location, a leg location, a torso location, etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention features a system comprising at least a first encapsulation device stacked on a second encapsulation device and connected by a connecting component (e.g., a suture, etc.). The connecting component allows vasculature to grow between the two encapsulation devices (e.g., the two devices are not sealed to the point that they don't allow for cell penetration between them, e.g., as opposed to a full seal that doses off space between the devices so that vasculature cannot grow). The connecting component may space the devices apart. Wherein the first encapsulation device and the second encapsulation device each comprise a lumen for holding cells and a vascularization membrane (e.g., surrounding the cells). Vasculature may surround at least a portion of the system and is disposed in at least a portion of a space between the first encapsulation device and the second encapsulation device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first encapsulation device is separated from the second encapsulation device a particular distance (e.g., to allow vasculature growth). In some embodiments, the first encapsulation device further comprises an immunoisolation membrane in between the lumen and the vascularization membrane. In some embodiments, the second encapsulation device further comprises an immunoisolation membrane in between the lumen and the vascularization membrane.

However, the system of the present invention may be used with oxygen (or air) delivery. In some embodiments, an oxygen delivery system is integrated into the system, e.g., integrated within the individual stacked encapsulation devices.

For example, in some embodiments, oxygen is temporarily delivered initially (e.g., initially upon implantation) until the system is adequately vascularized. In some embodiments, oxygen may be temporarily delivered and/or oxygen levels may be variable. For example, in some embodiments, a cell type is used that benefits from a high oxygen level. In some embodiments, a cell type is used that benefits from a low oxygen level (e.g., 15% or lower). In some embodiments, an oxygen level of about 21% oxygen (e.g., 20-22%) is used, e.g., air may be used. In some embodiments, an oxygen level from 15-22% is used. In some embodiments, an oxygen level from 10-15% is used. In some embodiments, an oxygen level from 5-10% is used. In some embodiments, an oxygen level from 0-5% is used. In some embodiments, a particular oxygen level is used initially and then the oxygen level is increased or decreased at a later time. In some embodiments, oxygen is turned on and then off. In some embodiments, oxygen is turned off and then on. In some embodiments, oxygen is turned on and off in a cycle for a period of time or indefinitely. In some embodiments, oxygen level is tailored to the application to help modulate the local immune system by providing temporary oxygen. In some embodiments, oxygen levels are tailed to when vascularization occurs. In some embodiments, immature cells are transplanted, and low oxygen levels may be used initially; as the cells mature (e.g., after a particular time, e.g., 4-6 weeks), higher oxygen levels may be provided.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, oxygen may be delivered to the systems via several different mechanisms.
