incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and a system and particularly to, for example, without limitation, a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same, and more particularly, to a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same which may prevent or minimize a reduction in sound characteristic caused by a reflected wave.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, the demand for sound bars or sound apparatuses outputting a sound through one or more speakers is increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, sound bars have a problem where a sound quality characteristic and/or a sound pressure level characteristic are/is reduced due to a sound interference between a plurality of speakers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The description provided in the discussion of the related art section should not be assumed to be prior art merely because it is mentioned in or associated with that section. The discussion of the related art section may include information that describes one or more aspects of the subject technology.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventors of the present disclosure have recognized the problems described above, have performed various experiments for preventing or minimizing a sound interference between a plurality of speakers, and have additionally performed various experiments for implementing a sound apparatus for outputting a stereo sound through sound separation for each channel or pitched sound band. In addition, the inventors have performed various experiments for implementing a sound apparatus that may prevent or minimize a reduction in sound characteristic caused by a reflected wave. The inventors have thus invented a new sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may prevent or minimize a sound interference between a plurality of speakers, have invented a new sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may output a stereo sound through sound separation for each channel or pitched sound band, and have invented a new sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may prevent or minimize a reduction in sound characteristic caused by a reflected wave.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to providing a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may prevent or minimize a reduction in sound characteristic caused by a reflected wave.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may prevent or minimize a sound interference between a plurality of speakers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more aspects of the present disclosure are directed to providing a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same that may output a stereo sound through sound separation for each channel or pitched sound band.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The objects of the present disclosure are not limited to the aforesaid, but other objects not described herein will be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the descriptions herein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features and aspects of the present disclosure are set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the inventive concepts provided herein. Other features and aspects of the inventive concepts may be realized and attained by the structures pointed out in the present disclosure, or derivable therefrom, and the claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve these and other aspects of the present disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, in one or more aspects, a sound apparatus may include a vibration member, a housing configured to cover a rear surface of the vibration member, and a vibration apparatus including one or more vibration devices configured to vibrate the vibration member. The vibration member may include a non-planar structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one or more aspects of the present disclosure, a sound apparatus may include a housing including an accommodation space, a vibration member configured to cover the accommodation space of the housing, the vibration member including first to n<sup>th </sup>(where n is a natural number of 3 or more) regions, and a vibration apparatus including one or more first to n<sup>th </sup>vibration devices configured to vibrate the first to n<sup>th </sup>regions of the vibration member. The housing may include a space separation portion separating the accommodation space into first to n<sup>th </sup>spaces respectively corresponding to the first to n<sup>th </sup>regions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one or more aspects of the present disclosure, a sound system may include a display apparatus configured to display an image, one or more first speaker apparatuses rotatably disposed near a first side of the display apparatus, each of the one or more first speaker apparatuses including a sound output apparatus, and one or more second speaker apparatuses rotatably disposed near a second side of the display apparatus, each of the one or more second speaker apparatuses including a sound output apparatus.

For example, an expression &#x201c;between a plurality of elements&#x201d; may be understood as between a plurality of elements or among a plurality of elements. For example, an expression &#x201c;among a plurality of elements&#x201d; may be understood as between a plurality of elements or among a plurality of elements. In one or more examples, the number of elements may be two.

It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is, for example, consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and should not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly defined otherwise herein. For example, the term &#x201c;part&#x201d; may apply, for example, to a separate circuit or structure, an integrated circuit, a computational block of a circuit device, or any structure configured to perform a described function as should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Hereinafter, a sound apparatus and a sound system including the same according to example embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.

For example, in the piezoelectric vibration portion <b>131</b><i>a</i>, a sound pressure level characteristic of a sound may be enhanced and a sound reproduction band may increase, based on various natural vibration frequencies according to a vibration of each of the plurality of first portions <b>131</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> having different sizes.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">The plurality of second portions <b>131</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> may be disposed between the plurality of first portions <b>131</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>.
