More specifically, the present invention is a hair clipper that easily fits in the palm of the user's hand and pivots to allow sharper cutting angles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cutting hair with hair clippers is one of the most common methods across the world and is used by professional barbers worldwide. Most hair clippers can be used to cut hair to a smaller length. This includes hair on the face and on the head. These hair clippers come in a variety of shapes and sizes but are typically too bulky to get desired results. Often, barbers are burdened with maneuvering bulky clippers around a client's head. Fatigue and inaccuracy are both consequences of having bulky clippers due to the weight and limited angles that the clippers allow. Most clippers also have an attached cord that supplies power from a socket. The cord can cause a major inconvenience to barbers by blocking the barber's vision and getting tangled in a client's hair. Sometimes, barbers have to flick the clippers to whip the cord away which can possibly introduce errors in the haircut. Bulky and corded clippers can produce inaccurate haircuts that can anger clients and overall decrease business.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An objective of the present invention is to increase cutting angles and comfort to barbers so they can provide more accurate haircuts to clients. The present invention is a small clipper that can adjust to different cutting angles. The present invention also comprises a grip that fits perfectly into a user's hand. The handheld clipper can increase accurate haircuts which result in more satisfied customers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is a cordless clipper that can pivot to provide more accurate haircuts. The present invention comprises a small grip, a hinge mechanism, and a set of blades. The grip allows users to easily handle the clipper while cutting hair. The hinge, rotating, and lever mechanisms ensure that multiple cutting angles are accessible during a haircut to accommodate different haircut styles. The present invention can charge though a charge port and comprises a backlit display that shows the battery life among other features. The small design also allows more maneuverability and portability for users. Additional benefits and features are further discussed below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top perspective view of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top perspective exploded view of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a bottom perspective exploded view of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a circuit schematic diagram used in the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAIL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">All illustrations of the drawings are for the purpose of describing selected versions of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.
