The propellant can also be a type other than a solid powder.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">If short firing range is desired, the propellant can be adapted to a certain extent to generate a suitable firing range for the specific projectile. However, there are limits, so that the propellant cannot be reduced to such a degree that fundamental technical requirements cannot be achieved. For example, a certain propellant is required in order to propel the projectile out from the barrel, and there may also be demands on the minimum charge size of the firing device, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the firing scenario when short trajectory is required, the projectile may be provided with a braking arrangement in order to effectively brake the projectile on its trajectory. Examples of braking arrangements may be various devices which deploy mechanically or otherwise from the projectile, but there may also be a brake firmly arranged on the projectile prior to its firing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mechanically deployable brakes are described, for example, in patent document WO 98/01719 A. The brake here consists of four different braking plates, which are unfolded or pushed out radially from the projectile and which form a planar braking surface, encircling the projectile in part. The solution is mechanically complex and requires space in the detonator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example of a braking device which is arranged on the projectile before its firing is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The braking arrangement is a washer which is arranged between the detonator of the projectile and the projectile body prior to its firing. The washer preferably has a planar braking surface which is situated in the direction of travel of the projectile and has a braking effect during the travel of the projectile to its target. The washer shown has a limited braking ability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable to solve the above-identified problem.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention an improved brake for detachable arrangement on projectiles is created, where the brake is configured with a braking surface which is situated in the direction of travel of the

an artillery piece, a brake washer can be arranged on the projectile.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the brake washer is situated between the detonator and the shell. The shell is also called the shell body or projectile body. The detonator can also be called the zone tube or timing tube, and is called the fuse in English. The detonator is arranged removably on the shell in a customary embodiment of artillery shells. A brake washer may then be arranged between the detonator and the shell. The detonator is preferably stored and transported separately from the shell and it is arranged and primed on the shell when the projectile is to be fired from the firing device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Brake washers are used when a short firing range is desired, for example when firing with high elevation. One alternative for achieving short firing range is to use a smaller amount of propellant, or a propellant which produces less gas release, but a minimum amount of propellant is needed in order to fire the projectile from the firing device in a secure manner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a conventional brake washer <b>1</b>, preferably formed of homogeneous metal, such as steel, which may be surface treated, for example to be stainless during storage. The brake washer <b>1</b> has a front side, with a surface X, and a rear side, with a surface Y, the front side with surface X being planar. The planar front side with surface X is situated perpendicular to an imaginary center line for a projectile where the brake washer <b>1</b> is arranged on a projectile <b>100</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> for an illustration of a projectile arranged with a brake washer <b>1</b>. The brake washer <b>1</b> is arranged with a central hole <b>2</b> which is designed to pass over the thread arranged on the detonator. Preferably, the shell is devised with a female thread and the detonator with a male thread, so that parts of the detonator pass through the brake washer <b>1</b>. Thus, the brake washer <b>1</b> is preferably arranged on the detonator <b>101</b> before the detonator <b>101</b> is arranged on the shell <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, a projectile <b>100</b> consists of or comprises a detonator <b>101</b> arranged on a shell <b>102</b>. The central hole <b>2</b> has a radius designed to pass over the detonator. One portion of the brake washer will be situated between the outer radius of the projectile and the thread situated on the detonator. The portion of the brake washer which is situated outside the outer radius of the projectile constitutes the active braking surface. The inner portion of the braking surface X has a radius &#x3c4;, and the outer radius of the washer, and thus the outer radius of the braking surface, is denoted as R.

Besides steel, a brake washer with middle segment can be made of other metals, such as aluminum, various forms of composites or plastics, ceramics, or various forms of powder, such as metal powder.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> was a brake configured with a hole <b>50</b> according to a sixth embodiment of the invention. The braking surface is designed with at least one hole <b>51</b>. The total surface of the brake is thus composed of the braking surface X<b>5</b> which is the surface between the outer radius R<b>5</b> and the inner radius r<b>5</b>, and the surface situated between the outer radius of the projectile r<b>5</b> and the radius of the hole <b>52</b>, minus the total surface of the hole <b>51</b> situated on the braking surface X<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a projectile <b>100</b> containing a detonator <b>101</b>, a shell body <b>102</b>, and a brake washer <b>1</b>. The detonator <b>101</b>, in one customary configuration, is produced with threads so that the detonator can be screwed onto the shell body <b>102</b>. A brake washer <b>1</b> is arranged between the detonator <b>101</b> and the shell body <b>102</b> when the detonator <b>101</b> is being arranged on the shell body <b>102</b>. The detonator <b>101</b> is arranged on the shell body <b>102</b> before the projectile is fired from the firing device; this event may also be called the priming. In concert with the priming, when the detonator is arranged on the shell body, the detonator can be programmed or otherwise adapted to the current firing mission and be arranged with a brake or brake washer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0048">The function and application of the brake is that the brake is arranged on the projectile before firing the projectile in connection with the projectile being primed, usually by arranging the brake on the detonator and screwing the detonator, with brake, onto the shell. When the projectile leaves the gun barrel, the brake will produce great air resistance (drag), which lessens the firing range of the projectile. The air resistance with the new brakes shown in the invention is increased as compared to relatively known brake washers in that the surface of the brake is increased, and by the brake configurations shown in the invention.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0049">One example of a brake is a conically shaped structure with an inner radius, r<b>1</b>, r<b>1</b>&#x2032;, r<b>2</b>, r<b>2</b>&#x2032;, r<b>3</b>, r<b>4</b>, r<b>5</b>, of 50 mm at the inner hole, an outer radius, R<b>1</b>, R<b>1</b>&#x2032;, R<b>2</b>, R<b>2</b>&#x2032;, R<b>3</b>, R<b>4</b>, R<b>5</b>, of 100 mm, a length 1, s, s&#x2032;, s<b>2</b>, s<b>2</b>&#x2032; of 40 mm, a thickness of 5 mm, and made of steel.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0050">The invention is not limited to the configurations shown especially, but instead can be varied in different ways within the patent claims.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0051">It is evident, for example, that the number, size, material and shape of the elements and parts making up the brake can be adapted according to the weapons system or systems and other design properties in the particular instance.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0052">It is evident that the above-described brakes for projectiles may comprise many different dimensions and projectile types, depending on the area of application and the barrel width. However, at least the most commonly occurring projectiles today, between around 20 mm and 200 mm, are considered above.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
