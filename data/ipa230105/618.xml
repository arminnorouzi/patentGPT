id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention relates to the design and function of a compressible valve replacement prosthesis, collared or uncollared, which can be deployed into a beating heart without extracorporeal circulation using a transcatheter delivery system. The design as discussed focuses on the deployment of a device via a minimally invasive fashion and by way of example considers a minimally invasive surgical procedure preferably utilizing the intercostal or subxyphoid space for valve introduction. In order to accomplish this, the valve is formed in such a manner that it can be compressed to fit within a delivery system and secondarily ejected from the delivery system into the annulus of a target valve such as a mitral valve or tricuspid valve.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="185.67mm" wi="145.03mm"

Annually approximately 90,000 valve replacements are conducted in the US. Traditional valve replacement surgery, the orthotopic replacement of a heart valve, is an &#x201c;open heart&#x201d; surgical procedure. Briefly, the procedure necessitates surgical opening of the thorax, the initiation of extra-corporeal circulation with a heart-lung machine, stopping and opening the heart, excision and replacement of the diseased valve, and re-starting of the heart. While valve replacement surgery typically carries a 1-4% mortality risk in otherwise healthy persons, a significantly higher morbidity is associated to the procedure largely due to the necessity for extra-corporeal circulation. Further, open heart surgery is often poorly tolerated in elderly patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, if the extra-corporeal component of the procedure could be eliminated, morbidities and the costs of valve replacement therapies would be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While replacement of the aortic valve in a transcatheter manner has been the subject of intense investigation, lesser attention has been focused on the mitral valve. This is in part reflective of the greater level of complexity associated to the native mitral valve apparatus and thus a greater level of difficulty with regards to inserting and anchoring the replacement prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Several designs for catheter-deployed (transcatheter) aortic valve replacement are under various stages of development. The Edwards SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve is currently undergoing clinical trial in patients with calcific aortic valve disease who are considered high-risk for conventional open-heart valve surgery. This valve is deployable via a retrograde transarterial (transfemoral) approach or an antegrade transapical (transventricular) approach. A key aspect of the Edwards SAPIEN and other transcatheter aortic valve replacement designs is their dependence on lateral fixation (e.g. tines) that engages the valve tissues as the primary anchoring mechanism. Such a design basically relies on circumferential friction around the valve housing or stent to prevent dislodgement during the cardiac cycle. This anchoring mechanism is facilitated by, and may somewhat depend on, a calcified aortic valve annulus. This design also requires that the valve housing or stent have a certain degree of rigidity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">At least one transcatheter mitral valve design is currently in development. The Endovalve uses a folding tripod-like design that delivers a tri-leaflet bioprosthetic valve. It is designed to be deployed from a minimally invasive transatrial approach, and could eventually be adapted to a transvenous atrial septotomy delivery. This design uses &#x201c;proprietary gripping features&#x201d; designed to engage the valve annulus and leaflets tissues. Thus the anchoring mechanism of this device is essentially equivalent to that used by transcatheter aortic valve replacement designs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One problem involves the repetitive deformation of the nitinol wire material commonly used in the manufacture of stented valves. Fatigue fractures of the metal wire material can result in a catastrophic structural failure whereby the valve support structure weakens and breaks. Although failure of a single wire may not necessarily cause a structural collapse of the entire valve, over time, this possibility becomes a practical reality. When the consequence of valve failure means the death of the patient, the importance cannot be overstated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various problems continue to exist in this field, including problems with perivalvular leaking around installed prosthetic valve, lack of a good fit and stability for the prosthetic valve within the native mitral annulus, atrial tissue erosion, excess wear on the metallic structures, interference with the aorta at the posterior side of the mitral annulus, difficulties in deployment and retrieval, and lack of customization, to name a few. Accordingly, there exists a need for the improvement inventions disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to improvements for prosthetic valves intended to be deployed into a closed beating heart using a transcatheter delivery system. The invention provides improved stability, in-growth of the prosthetic, maintains structural integrity over large cycles, addresses biocompatibility issues, addresses commissural regurgitation, and addresses hemocompatibility issues. Additionally, the invention addresses problems related to unwanted buckling of the material, lack of sealing of the prosthetic valve within the valvular annulus, unwanted twisting of fabrics, and difficulties arising from elasticity during attachment of the cover to the stent.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Improved Surfaces</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment,

prosthetic valves, especially for use in cardiac surgeries. Specifically, the invention relates to improved designs and features providing better stability, fit, durability and ease of delivery and retrieval for such prosthetic valves. For the purposes of this application, the terms &#x201c;collar&#x201d; and &#x201c;sealing cuff&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Improved Surface Components</heading><p id="p-0274" num="0273">In one embodiment, the invention provides improvement in the surface components and structures for prosthetic valves intended to be deployed into a closed beating heart using a transcatheter delivery system. The combination of unique features herein addresses many of the issues and points of failure in current valve technology and provides a highly developed approach to the extraordinary number of problems that arise when attempting to provide a medical device of this type. The invention provides improved in-growth of the prosthetic, maintains structural integrity over large cycles, addresses biocompatibility issues, and addresses hemocompatibility issues. Additionally, the invention addresses problems related to unwanted buckling of the surface material, lack of sealing of the prosthetic valve within the valvular annulus, unwanted twisting of fabrics, and difficulties arising from elasticity during attachment of the cover to the stent.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">In a preferred embodiment, there is provided a multi-layer cover for a prosthetic heart valve having an expandable tubular stent and an expandable internal leaflet assembly, wherein said stent is a tubular wire-form having an interior wall and an exterior wall, and wherein said leaflet assembly is disposed within the stent to form a valve and is comprised of stabilized tissue or synthetic material, wherein the multi-layer cover comprises at least two layers of stabilized tissue or synthetic material, a first layer comprised of a polyester material and a second layer comprised of a polyester material or stabilized tissue, wherein the first layer is attached to the interior wall of the stent and the second layer is attached to the exterior wall of the stent.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Stabilized Tissue or Biocompatible Synthetic Material</heading><p id="p-0276" num="0275">In one embodiment, it is contemplated that multiple types of tissue and biocompatible material may be used to line or cover both the inner &#x201c;interior&#x201d; and/or outer &#x201c;exterior&#x201d; lateral walls of the stent, and to line or cover embodiments utilizing the integral sealing cuff. As stated previously, the leaflet component may be constructed solely from stabilized tissue or synthetic material, with or without using an additional wire support, to create a leaflet assembly and valve leaflets. In this aspect, the leaflet component may be attached to the stent with or without the use of the wire form.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">It is contemplated that the tissue may be used to cover the inside of the stent body, but that the outside of the stent body is lined or covered with either tissue or synthetic material. Where the stent is heat formed to created a sealing cuff structure, the top &#x201c;side&#x201d; of the cuff wire form (formerly the interior until the stent was heat formed) will be lined with tissue, whereas the underside of the sealing cuff will be lined, similar to the exterior, with tissue or more preferably synthetic material</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">In one preferred embodiment, the tissue used herein is optionally a biological tissue and may be a chemically stabilized valve of an animal, such as a pig. In another preferred embodiment, the biological tissue is used to make leaflets that are sewn or attached to a metal frame. This tissue is chemically stabilized pericardial tissue of an animal, such as a cow (bovine pericardium) or sheep (ovine pericardium) or pig (porcine pericardium) or horse (equine pericardium).</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Preferably, the tissue is bovine pericardial tissue. Examples of suitable tissue include that used in the products Duraguard&#xae;, Peri-Guard&#xae;, and Vascu-Guard&#xae;, all products currently used in surgical procedures, and which are marketed as being harvested generally from cattle less than 30 months old. Other patents and publications disclose the surgical use of harvested, biocompatible animal thin tissues suitable herein as biocompatible &#x201c;jackets&#x201d; or sleeves for implantable stents, including for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,185 to Block, U.S. Pat. No. 7,108,717 to Design &#x26; Performance-Cyprus Limited disclosing a covered stent assembly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,164 to Scimed Life Systems, Inc. disclosing a bioprosthetic valve for implantation, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,616 to LifeCell Corporation discloses acellular collagen-based tissue matrix for transplantation.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">In one preferred embodiment, the synthetic material is a polyurethane or polytetrafluoroethylene. The synthetic polymer materials include expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester may optionally be used. Other suitable materials may optionally include thermoplastic polycarbonate urethane, polyether urethane, segmented polyether urethane, silicone polyether urethane, silicone-polycarbonate urethane, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Additional biocompatible polymers may optionally include polyolefins, elastomers, polyethylene-glycols, polyethersulphones, polysulphones, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyvinylchlorides, other fluoropolymers, silicone polyesters, siloxane polymers and/or oligomers, and/or polylactones, and block co-polymers using the same.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">In another embodiment, the tissue and/or synthetic material liner/cover may optionally have a surface that has been treated with (or reacted with) an anti-coagulant, such as, without limitation, immobilized heparin. Such currently available heparinized polymers are known and available to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Layers</heading><p id="p-0282" num="0281">In one preferred embodiment, the layering of the stent and the synthetic material and tissue may be provided in various options. For example, in one preferred embodiment, it is contemplated that the interior layer (within the lumen of the stent) is Dacron&#xae; (aka PET), and the outer exterior of the stent is lined or covered with stabilized tissue as described herein. In another embodiment, there is Dacron&#xae; both on the interior and the exterior of the stent, where one or both may be electrospun PET to provide the microscopic &#x2018;hairs&#x2019; necessary for in-growth. In another embodiment, the prosthetic valve may have a synthetic layer on top of a tissue layer for an exterior, and have a tissue layer on the interior.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">Electros pun Fibers</heading><p id="p-0283" num="0282">Electrospinning is a technology that produces polymer fibers with diameters ranging from the nano- to the microscale. Fabrics with complex shapes can be electrospun from solutions, producing a broad range of fiber and fabric properties. Electrospinning produces materials with high surface to weight and volume ratios, which makes these materials excellent candidates for controlled biological interactions, especially construction of fibrous extra-cellular matrix scaffolds. The porous nature of the fabric coupled with the ability to spin many types of polymers allows for the formation of implantable structures. Here, the prosthetic valve cover material can use the electrospun fabric as a scaffolding to allow integration into the body, also known as in-growth or cell attachment (both endothelialization and smooth muscle cell attachment). Additives, ranging from therapeutic agents to property modifiers, can be introduced into the solutions and become incorporated into the fibers and fabrics.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">In preferred embodiments, the synthetic material will range in thickness from about 0.001&#x2033; (0.0254 mm) to about 0.015&#x2033; (0.3809 mm), or from about 0.002&#x2033; (0.0508 mm) to about 0.010&#x2033; (0.254 mm), or alternatively wherein both the first layer and the second layer are about 0.005&#x2033; (0.127 mm) in thickness. Preferred materials may be obtained from Zeus Co., Orangeburg, S.C.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">By creating a sandwiched prosthetic valve made using a nitinol (or similar) stent that has extremely thin tissue on the inside and extremely thin synthetic, e.g. Dacron&#xae;, on the outside, very small but very durable prosthetic valves can be created and, importantly, delivered via the less-invasive, safer transcatheter delivery techniques.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Synthetics and polymers contemplated as within the scope of the present invention support long-term cell growth, without cytotoxic or mutagenic effects, and have a degradation profile consistant with its usage. For example, the material should promote in-growth but not degrade prior to effective in-growth, where the rate of degradation matches the rate of tissue attachment. Also, degradation by-products must be similarly non-toxic and biocompatible.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Biodegradable materials contemplated as within the scope of the present invention include without limitation polyesters such as polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactide-co-polyglycolide (PLGA), co-polymers of poly-L-lactide and polycaprolactone (PLLA-CL), and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV). Also contemplated as within the scope of the invention are polyanhydrides, polyamides, modified polysaccharides, polyalkene glycols (e.g. PEG), polyalkene oxides (e.g. PEO, PEO-co-PBT), and polyalkene terephthalates (e.g. PBT), and ethylene-vinyl acetate co-polymers.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">However, non-degradable polymers may also be used but with biocompatible coatings in order to reduce problems known in the art that arise with the use of certain polymers such as immune responses, thrombotic responses, and cell toxicity. include non-degradable materials such as polytetrafluoroehtylene (PTFE), polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate, poly n-butyl methacrylate, poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene,</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">The co-polymers may vary in the range of the ratio of one polymer to the copolymer from a ratio of about 5:95 to a ratio of about 95:5.

The first function of the prosthetic valve is to be a substitute for the native valve, but with improved functions, such as inhibiting perivalvular leak/regurgitation of blood by flexing and sealing across the irregular contours of the annulus and atrium.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">The second function of the valve collar is to provide adjustability and compliance once the prosthetic is seated.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">The heart and its structures undergo complex conformational changes during the cardiac cycle. For example, the mitral valve annulus has a complex geometric shape known as a hyperbolic parabloid much like a saddle, with the horn being anterior, the seat back being posterior, and the left and right valleys located medially and laterally. Beyond this complexity, the area of the mitral annulus changes over the course of the cardiac cycle. Further, the geometry of the tricuspid valve and tricuspid annulus continues to be a topic of research, posing its own particular problems. Accordingly, compliance is a very important but unfortunately often overlooked requirement of cardiac devices. Compliance here refers to the ability of the valve to maintain structural position and integrity during the cardiac cycle. Compliance with the motion of the heart is a particularly important feature, especially the ability to provide localized compliance where the underlying surfaces are acting differently from the adjacent surfaces. This ability to vary throughout the cardiac cycle allows the valve to remain seated and properly deployed in a manner not heretofore provided.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">Additionally, compliance may be achieved through the use of the tethers where the tethers are preferably made from an elastic material. Tether-based compliance may be used alone, or in combination with the collar-based compliance.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">The third function of the valve/collar is to provide a valve that, during surgery, is able to be seated and be able to contour to the irregular surfaces of the atrium. The use of independent tethers allows for side to side fitting of the valve within the annulus. For example, where three tethers are used, they are located circumferentially about 120 degrees relative to each other which allows the surgeon to observe whether or where perivalvular leaking might be occurring and to pull on one side or the other to create localized pressure and reduce or eliminate the leaking.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">The forth function of the collar is to counter the forces that act to displace the prosthesis toward/into the ventricle (i.e. atrial pressure and flow-generated shear stress) during ventricular filling.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302">Additional features of the collar include that it functions to strengthen the leaflet assembly/stent combination by providing additional structure. Further, during deployment, the collar functions to guide the entire structure, the prosthetic valve, into place at the mitral annulus during deployment and to keep the valve in place once it is deployed.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">Another very important feature in one embodiment of the present invention is that the design of the valve allows the leaflets to be located high within the stent body, in the top half (atrial) of the lumen of the stent, or even at or near the atrial top end of the stent portion of the prosthetic valve. By allowing the leaflets to be located high within the stent body, the reduces the occurrence of LVOT obstruction (Left Ventricular Outflow Tract obstruction), a situation where the blood leaving the left ventricle to the aortic valve is obstructed and/or has it's laminar flow disrupted. In some circumstances this pathological condition is caused by having a stent or other medical device at or near the mitral valve area that extends too far into the left ventricle itself.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">Annular Cuff/Collar Structure</heading><p id="p-0305" num="0304">The collar is a substantially flat, circular, band-shaped collar structure that is attached to and encircles the tubular stent forming a V-shape, when viewed in cross-section, between the exterior wall of the tubular stent and the flat, circular band-shaped annular expansion gasket. The stiff-yet-flexible nature of the attached (or integrated) gasket in a V-shape collar establishes a &#x201c;cork&#x201d; or &#x201c;shuttlecock&#x201d; type of structure that when the prosthetic valve is deployed into the annulus of the valve, e.g. mitral valve, the wedge-ring shape of the device, with its spring-like pusher band to provide a lateral annular compressive pressure or force against the native valve annulus to immobilize the valve and provide a seal between the cardiac chambers, e.g. the atrium and the ventricular, to re-establish valve function via the prosthetic valve. As viewed from a side perspective, the collar diameter matches the diameter of the tubular stent where the collar is attached to the stent nearest the ventricle, but as the collar and stent wall form a V-shape, the diameter of the collar gets larger and larger, until it reaches it's maximum diameter at the atrial terminus of the collar panel. As used herein, the term collar, inverted flange, gasket, spring panel, are considered to be functionally equivalent. When the tubular stent is pulled through the mitral valve aperture, the mitral annulus, by the tether loops in the direction of the left ventricle, the flexible collar acts as to stop the tubular stent from traveling any further through the mitral valve aperture. At this point, the entire prosthetic valve is held by lateral pressure caused by the forcible compression of the advancing spring-like collar through the mitral annulus, and the longitudinal forces ventricular tethers attached to the left ventricle.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">The collar is preferably formed from a web of polyester fabric spanning from the distal end of the stent body to a support structure made from superelastic metal. Alternatively, the web made be made from a stiff, flexible shape-memory material such as the nickel-titanium alloy material Nitinol&#xae; wire that is covered by stabilized tissue or other suitable biocompatible or synthetic material.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">In one embodiment, the collar wire form is constructed from independent loops of wire creating lobes or segments extending axially around the circumference of the bend or seam where the collar transitions to the tubular stent (in an integral collar) or where the collar is attached to the stent (where they are separate, but joined components). The collar forms an acute angle in relation to the exterior wall of the tubular stent body.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">In another embodiment, the collar is constructed from an attached panel. In this embodiment, the panel may be a solid metal band, or may be perforated, woven, or laser cut to provide a mesh-like surface, or may be a polyester fabric material.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0308">Because of the material's flexibility, the collar has the ability to articulate back and forth, along the lateral axis compared to the longitudinal axis that runs length-wise through the center of the tubular stent. In other words, where the metal has loops or is woven, the individual spindles or loops can independently move back and forth, and can spring back to their original position due to the relative stiffness of the wire. The collar has a certain modulus of elasticity such that, when attached to the wire of the stent, is able to allow the collar to move. This flexibility gives the collar, upon being deployed within a patient's heart, the ability to conform to the anatomical shape necessary for a particular application. In the example of a prosthetic mitral valve, the collar is able to conform to the irregularities of the left atrium and shape of the mitral annulus, and to provide a tight seal against the atrial tissue adjacent the mitral annulus and the tissue within the mitral annulus. As stated previously, this feature importantly provides a degree of flexibility in sizing the a mitral valve and prevents blood from leaking around the implanted prosthetic heart valve.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">In one preferred wire collar embodiment, the wire spindles of the collar are substantially uniform in shape and size. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, each loop or spindle may be of varying shapes and sizes. In this example, it is contemplated that the loops may form a pattern of alternating large and small loops, depending on where the valve is being deployed. In the case of a prosthetic mitral valve, pre-operative imaging may allow for customizing the structure of the sealing cuff depending on a particular patient's anatomical geometry in the vicinity of the mitral annulus.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">The sealing cuff wire form is constructed so as to provide sufficient structural integrity to withstand the intracardiac forces without collapsing. The sealing cuff wire form is preferably constructed of a web of polyester fabric spanning from the distal end of the stent body to a support structure made from a superelastic metal, such as Nitinol&#x2122;&#xae; and is capable of maintaining its function as a sealing collar for the tubular stent while under longitudinal forces that might cause a structural deformation or valve displacement. It is contemplated as within the scope of the invention to optionally use other shape memory alloys such as Cu&#x2014;Zn&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Ni alloys, and Cu&#x2014;Al&#x2014;Ni alloys. The heart is known to generate an average left atrial pressure between about 8 and 30 mm Hg (about 0.15 to 0.6 psi). This left atrial filling pressure is the expected approximate pressure that would be exerted in the direction of the left ventricle when the prosthesis is open against the outer face of the collar as an anchoring force holding the collar against the mitral valve annulus. The collar counteracts this downward longitudinal pressure against the prosthesis in the direction of the left ventricle to keep the valve from being displaced or slipping into the ventricle. In contrast, left ventricular systolic pressure, normally about 120 mm Hg, exerts a force on the closed prosthesis in the direction of the left atrium. The tethers counteract this force and are used to maintain the valve position and withstand the ventricular force during ventricular contraction or systole. Accordingly, the collar has sufficient structural integrity to provide the necessary tension against the tethers without being dislodged and pulled into the left ventricle. Tethers and anchors may also be used to secure position against any other directional forces as necessary. After a period of time, changes in the geometry of the heart and/or fibrous adhesion between prosthesis and surrounding cardiac tissues may assist or replace the function of the ventricular tethers in resisting longitudinal forces on the valve prosthesis during ventricular contraction.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="2">Annular Clamp Structure and Function</heading><p id="p-0312" num="0311">It is possible for a prosthetic valve stent to be stabilized within the valvular annulus through the use of integrated clamps located at intervals around the circumference of the stent.

Attached to the distal end of each of the two middle members, two or more semicircular fingers, with an equal number of such fingers attached to each middle member such that, upon closing of the hinge, the open side of the semicircle faces inward and the closed side faces outward.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0313">In this embodiment, the dual sets of semicircular fingers would move towards one another as the hinge closes and away from one another as the hinge opens. The semicircular fingers are attached to the middle members in a staggered fashion such that the semicircular members interdigitate upon closing. Finally, the tip of each semicircular finger tapers to form a point capable of piercing valve annulus tissue, allowing for a firm stabilizing anchor for both the stent and the valve it contains.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">In a more preferred embodiment, the clamp assembly described above shall be manufactured similar to the dimensions indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>A-<b>37</b>F</figref>.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0315">The clamp of the immediately preceding embodiment may be comprised within a clamp-based valve anchoring system in which two flexible members, each with a preformed bend and protruding from a delivery housing, wherein each such flexible member is attached to the flange of each middle member, such that the flexible member is straightened upon retraction into the delivery housing, and the action of straightening the flexible member applies pressure to the two flanges, closing the hinge.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316">In another preferred embodiment, the clamp body would comprise a hinge made of a pin, optionally surrounded by a spring, said pin extending through holes in the proximal ends of each of two or more closing members, which hinge can be manipulated into a closed or open position.

The defect can either be congenital or degenerative, with causal factors ranging from marfan syndrome to drug- or radiation-inducement.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0342">&#x201c;Secondary MR&#x201d; (also known as &#x201c;Functional MR&#x201d;), unlike Primary MR, is classified as a defect in valvular function or mechanics, as opposed to an anatomical defect. In such cases, an anatomically normal mitral valve has become regurgitant, usually as a result of impaired left ventricle from dilated cardiomyopathy or a myocardial infarction. Causality can be either ischemic or nonischemic. Specifically, chordae tendinae and papillary muscles can be stretched from increased tension, and the valve annulus itself may become distended due to the altered position of surrounding myocardium. Frequently, dilation of the left ventricle results in &#x201c;volume overload&#x201d; of blood during periods of systole, inhibiting full coaptation of the leaflets.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0343">Secondary MR involves a defect in valvular function or mechanics, as opposed to an anatomical defect.

Examples of procedures to limit the size of the mitral orifice and/or enhance leaflet coaptation include the anchoring of one or more balloon devices across the mitral valve orifice to provide a backstop for leaflet coaptation and the use of sutures or clips to attach the leaflets at the point of coaptation. These methods are known to involve thrombotic and stenotic complications.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0345">Secondary MR can be subclassified by leaflet movement (Carpentier's classification): type I (normal valve movement, such as annular dilatation or leaflet perforation); type II (excessive movement); and type III (restrictive movement: Ma-diastolic restriction such as rheumatic disease; Mb-systolic restriction as in functional disease).</p><p id="p-0348" num="0346">One particular aspect of secondary or &#x201c;functional&#x201d; mitral regurgitation is the presence of a &#x201c;central jet&#x201d; of regurgitant blood flowing through and near the center of the point of coaptation during regurgitation.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0347">In one non-limiting preferred embodiment, the prosthetic valve is used to close the valve to this central jet flow, while leaving the commissures free to seal. This embodiment has yielded unexpected benefits in ameliorating the effects of commissural regurgitation and/or secondary mitral regurgitation, such as LV hypertrophy. It is thought that this unexpected benefit is likely due benefit is potentially due to the overall reduction in regurgitation and increased pumping efficiency, combined with the lessened deformity of the native commissures, this eliminating most or all of the mitral commissural regurgitation.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0348">In another non-limiting preferred embodiment, the diameter of the stent body should be less than the diameter of the native mitral annulus.

In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the leaflet assembly comprises a leaflet wire support structure to which the leaflets are attached and the entire leaflet assembly is housed within the stent body. In this embodiment, the assembly is constructed of wire and stabilized tissue to form a suitable platform for attaching the leaflets. In this aspect, the wire and stabilized tissue allow for the leaflet structure to be compressed when the prosthetic valve is compressed within the deployment catheter, and to spring open into the proper functional shape when the prosthetic valve is opened during deployment. In this embodiment, the leaflet assembly may optionally be attached to and housed within a separate cylindrical liner made of stabilized tissue or material, and the liner is then attached to line the interior of the stent body.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0356">In this embodiment, the leaflet wire support structure is constructed to have a collapsible/expandable geometry. In a preferred embodiment, the structure is a single piece of wire. The wireform is, in one embodiment, constructed from a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol. The structure may optionally be made of a plurality of wires, including between 2 to 10 wires. Further, the geometry of the wire form is without limitation, and may optionally be a series of parabolic inverted collapsible arches to mimic the saddle-like shape of the native annulus when the leaflets are attached. Alternatively, it may optionally be constructed as collapsible concentric rings, or other similar geometric forms that are able to collapse/compress which is followed by an expansion to its functional shape. In certain preferred embodiments, there may be 2, 3 or 4 arches. In another embodiment, closed circular or ellipsoid structure designs are contemplated. In another embodiment, the wire form may be an umbrella-type structure, or other similar unfold-and-lock-open designs. A preferred embodiment utilizes super elastic Nitinol wire approximately 0.015&#x2033; in diameter. In one preferred embodiment, the diameter is 0.012&#x2033;. In this embodiment, the wire is wound around a shaping fixture in such a manner that 2-3 commissural posts are formed. The fixture containing the wrapped wire is placed in a muffle furnace at a pre-determined temperature to set the shape of the wire form and to impart it's super elastic properties. Secondarily, the loose ends of the wireform are joined with a stainless steel or Nitinol tube and crimped to form a continuous shape. In another preferred embodiment, the commissural posts of the wireform are adjoined at their tips by a circular connecting ring, or halo, whose purpose is to minimize inward deflection of the post(s).</p><p id="p-0362" num="0357">In another preferred embodiment, the leaflet assembly is constructed solely of stabilized tissue or other suitable material without a separate wire support structure. The leaflet assembly in this embodiment is also disposed within the lumen of the stent and is attached to the stent to provide a sealed joint between the leaflet assembly and the inner wall of the stent. By definition, it is contemplated within the scope of the invention that any structure made from stabilized tissue and/or wire(s) related to supporting the leaflets within the stent constitute a leaflet assembly.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0358">In this embodiment, stabilized tissue or suitable material may also optionally be used as a liner for the inner wall of the stent and is considered part of the leaflet assembly.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0359">Liner tissue or biocompatible material may be processed to have the same or different mechanical qualities, e.g. thickness, durability, etc. from the leaflet tissue.</p><p id="p-0365" num="0000">Deployment within the Valvular Annulus</p><p id="p-0366" num="0360">The prosthetic heart valve is, in one embodiment, apically delivered through the apex of the left ventricle of the heart using a catheter system. In one aspect of the apical delivery, the catheter system accesses the heart and pericardial space by intercostal delivery. In another delivery approach, the catheter system delivers the prosthetic heart valve using either an antegrade or retrograde delivery approach using a flexible catheter system, and without requiring the rigid tube system commonly used. In another embodiment, the catheter system accesses the heart via a trans-septal approach.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0361">In one non-limiting preferred embodiment, the stent body extends into the ventricle about to the edge of the open mitral valve leaflets (approximately 25% of the distance between the annulus and the ventricular apex). The open native leaflets lay against the outside stent wall and parallel to the long axis of the stent (i.e. the stent holds the native mitral valve open).</p><p id="p-0368" num="0362">In one non-limiting preferred embodiment, the diameter should approximately match the diameter of the mitral annulus. Optionally, the valve may be positioned to sit in the mitral annulus at a slight angle directed away from the aortic valve such that it is not obstructing flow through the aortic valve. Optionally, the outflow portion (bottom) of the stent should not be too close to the lateral wall of the ventricle or papillary muscle as this position may interfere with flow through the prosthesis. As these options relate to the tricuspid, the position of the tricuspid valve may be very similar to that of the mitral valve.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0363">In another embodiment, the prosthetic valve is sized and configured for use in areas other than the mitral annulus, including, without limitation, the tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle. Alternative embodiments may optionally include variations to the sealing cuff structure to accommodate deployment to the pulmonary valve between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve between the left ventricle and the aorta. In one embodiment, the prosthetic valve is optionally used as a venous backflow valve for the venous system, including without limitation the vena cava, femoral, subclavian, pulmonary, hepatic, renal and cardiac. In this aspect, the sealing cuff feature is utilized to provide additional protection against leaking.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">Tethers</heading><p id="p-0370" num="0364">In one preferred embodiment, there are tethers attached to the prosthetic heart valve that extend to one or more tissue anchor locations within the heart. In one preferred embodiment, the tethers extend downward through the left ventricle, exiting the left ventricle at the apex of the heart to be fastened on the epicardial surface outside of the heart. Similar anchoring is contemplated herein as it regards the tricuspid, or other valve structure requiring a prosthetic. There may be from 1 to 8 tethers which are preferably attached to the stent.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0365">In another preferred embodiment, the tethers may optionally be attached to the sealing cuff to provide additional control over position, adjustment, and compliance. In this preferred embodiment, one or more tethers are optionally attached to the sealing cuff, in addition to, or optionally, in place of, the tethers attached to the stent. By attaching to the sealing cuff and/or the stent, an even higher degree of control over positioning, adjustment, and compliance is provided to the operator during deployment.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0366">During deployment, the operator is able to adjust or customize the tethers to the correct length for a particular patient's anatomy. The tethers also allow the operator to tighten the sealing cuff onto the tissue around the valvular annulus by pulling the tethers, which creates a leak-free seal.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0367">In another preferred embodiment, the tethers are optionally anchored to other tissue locations depending on the particular application of the prosthetic heart valve. In the case of a mitral valve, or the tricuspid valve, there are optionally one or more tethers anchored to one or both papillary muscles, septum, and/or ventricular wall.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0368">The tethers, in conjunction with the sealing cuff or collar, provide for a compliant valve which has heretofore not been available. The tethers are made from surgical-grade materials such as biocompatible polymer suture material. Examples of such material include 2-0 exPFTE (polytetrafluoroethylene) or 2-0 polypropylene. In one embodiment the tethers are inelastic. It is also contemplated that one or more of the tethers may optionally be elastic to provide an even further degree of compliance of the valve during the cardiac cycle. Upon being drawn to and through the apex of the heart, the tethers may be fastened by a suitable mechanism such as tying off to a pledget or similar adjustable button-type anchoring device to inhibit retraction of the tether back into the ventricle. It is also contemplated that the tethers might be bioresorbable/bioabsorbable and thereby provide temporary fixation until other types of fixation take hold such a biological fibrous adhesion between the tissues and prosthesis and/or radial compression from a reduction in the degree of heart chamber dilation.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0369">Further, it is contemplated that the prosthetic heart valve may optionally be deployed with a combination of installation tethers and permanent tethers, attached to either the stent or sealing cuff, or both, the installation tethers being removed after the valve is successfully deployed. It is also contemplated that combinations of inelastic and elastic tethers may optionally be used for deployment and to provide structural and positional compliance of the valve during the cardiac cycle.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="2">Pledget</heading><p id="p-0376" num="0370">In one embodiment, to control the potential tearing of tissue at the apical entry point of the delivery system, a circular, semi-circular, or multi-part pledget is employed. The pledget may be constructed from a semi-rigid material such as PFTE felt. Prior to puncturing of the apex by the delivery system, the felt is firmly attached to the heart such that the apex is centrally located. Secondarily, the delivery system is introduced through the central area, or orifice as it may be, of the pledget. Positioned and attached in this manner, the pledget acts to control any potential tearing at the apex.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">Tines/Barbs</heading><p id="p-0377" num="0371">In another embodiment the valve can be seated within the valvular annulus through the use of tines or barbs. These may be used in conjunction with, or in place of one or more tethers. The tines or barbs are located to provide attachment to adjacent tissue. In one preferred embodiment, the tines are optionally circumferentially located around the bend/transition area between the stent and the sealing cuff. Such tines are forced into the annular tissue by mechanical means such as using a balloon catheter. In one non-limiting embodiment, the tines may optionally be semi-circular hooks that upon expansion of the stent body, pierce, rotate into, and hold annular tissue securely.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">Functions of the Spring Anchor</heading><p id="p-0378" num="0372">The spring anchor will form a spring-shaped wire or banded extending from the base of the self-expanding stent. The anchor will provide support to hold the stent within the natural valve annulus by being coiled around the chordae tendineae extending from the natural valve annulus. The spring mechanism of the anchor will allow consistent support to the prosthetic valve stent, despite repetitive deformation as the chordae tendineae, valve annulus and surrounding tissue contract and release. The shape memory characteristics of the coil will allow each loop deform and move independently in response to each heart contraction, and then return to the original coil dimensions as the heart relaxes. The placement of the coil around the chordae tendineae will anchor the stent to counteract the natural tendency of the stent to move laterally with the cardiac tissue contractions and releases, and longitudinally with the blood flow between the ventricle and the atrium.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="2">Deployment of the Spring Anchor</heading><p id="p-0379" num="0373">The spring anchor will be fused to the prosthetic valve stent via either welding, soldering or adhesion prior to insertion of the entire valve and anchor assembly into a delivery catheter.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0374">The delivery catheter will approach the heart via either transvenous, transarterial or percutaneous delivery. Delivery may be made through into the left or right ventricle, or the left or right atrium.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0375">Delivery into the right ventricle may be made through the intercostal space and thereby through the lateral ventricular wall. Delivery into the right atrium may be made using a transvenous approach.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0376">Delivery into the left ventricle may be made through the intercostal space, using an apical approach or through the lateral ventricular wall. A transarterial retrograde aortic valve approach and a transvenous septostomy approach may also be used.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0377">Upon deployment of the self-expanding prosthetic valve within the native valvular annulus, whether in the tricuspid valve annulus, mitral valve annulus, or otherwise, the catheter sheath will be withdrawn, allowing the spring anchor to deploy. Such anchor deployment will result in the expanding of the coiled loops into a spring-like shape of sufficient diameter to allow circumnavigation of the chordae tendineae.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0378">After release of the spring anchor, control of the anchor will be maintained via surgical tools contained within the catheter and known in the art to guide the anchor around the chordae tendineae in a rotating, screw-like motion. The number of rotations performed will be determined by the number of loops contained within the spring anchor.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0379">Alternatively, the surgeon may use a surgical tool contained within the catheter and known in the art to secure and pull the chordae tendineae within the circumference of one or more loops of the anchor.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0380">Upon securing the anchor around the chordae tendineae, surgical tools may or may not be used to secure one or more anchoring tethers to surrounding pericardial tissue for additional support.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0381">Upon the securing of the valve stent within the native annulus, the spring anchor around the chordae tendineae and the tethers, if any, to the pericardial tissue, all surgical tools manipulating said components will be disengaged, pulled into the catheter and the catheter withdrawn.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="2">Spring Anchor Structure</heading><p id="p-0388" num="0382">The spring anchor is a single wire or band of shape-memory material, for example a 0.012&#x2033; Nitinol wire, formed into a series of two or more circular loops, in which the proximal loop is attached to the base of the prosthetic valve stent.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0383">Once the proximal loop has been attached to the base of the self-expanding stent, the additional loop(s) will radiate outward axially from the stent in the shape of a spring. The distal loop will be open, allowing for the tip to be placed outside a chordae tendineae during deployment, then rotated about a plurality of chordae tendineae in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction until each non-proximal loop is deployed about and anchored against the outer tissue of the chordae tendineae.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0384">In a preferred embodiment, the spring anchor is made of material identical to the material used to construct the base of the stent. In another preferred embodiment, the material of the anchor differs from the material of the stent base.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0385">In a preferred embodiment, the proximal loop of the spring anchor is welded to the base of the stent, forming a continuous joint around the full diameter of the base. In another embodiment, the proximal loop of the anchor is soldered to the stent base, or adhered to the stent base using an adhesive substance known in the art.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0386">Because of the shape-memory material's flexibility, the anchor has the ability to articulate back and forth both laterally and longitudinally, while returning to its original shape formation after each deformation. The loops can independently move back and forth, and can spring back to their original position due to the relative stiffness of the wire or band. The coil has a certain modulus of elasticity such that, when attached to the wire of the stent, is able to allow the collar to move. This flexibility gives the anchor, upon being deployed within a patient's heart, the ability to conform to the anatomical shape necessary for a particular application. In the example of a prosthetic mitral valve, the anchor is able to conform to the irregularities in the shape and disposition of the chordae tendineae, and to provide a tight grip against the chordae tendineae tissue to provide support to the prosthetic valve. As stated previously, this feature importantly provides a degree of flexibility in sizing the anchor and prevents dislocation of the anchor and/or prosthetic valve due to wear.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0387">In one preferred anchor embodiment, each loop in the coil is substantially uniform in shape and diameter. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the loops may be of varying shapes and sizes. In this example, it is contemplated that the loops may gradually increase in diameter as they extend away from the stent base. The size and pattern of the loops may vary based on whether the valve replacement is being performed on the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0388">The anchor form is constructed so as to provide sufficient structural integrity to withstand the intracardiac forces without dislocating, permanently deforming or fracturing. The anchor assembly is preferably constructed of a wire or band constructed of a shape memory alloy, polymer or ceramic, such as Nitinol&#xae;, that is capable of maintaining its function as an anchor for the tubular stent while under lateral and longitudinal forces that might cause a structural deformation or valve displacement. It is contemplated as within the scope of the invention to optionally use other shape memory alloys or materials such as listed herein.</p><p id="p-0395" num="0389">For example, assuming a mitral valve replacement prosthesis, the heart is known to generate an average left atrial pressure between about 8 and 30 mm Hg (about 0.15 to 0.6 psi). This left atrial filling pressure is the expected approximate pressure that would be exerted in the direction of the left ventricle when the prosthesis is open against the prosthesis within the mitral valve annulus. The anchor counteracts this downward longitudinal pressure against the prosthesis in the direction of the left ventricle to keep the valve from being displaced or slipping into the ventricle. In contrast, left ventricular systolic pressure, normally about 120 mm Hg, exerts a force on the closed prosthesis in the direction of the left atrium. The anchor would also counteract this force and be used to maintain the valve position and withstand the ventricular force during ventricular contraction or systole. Tethers may also be used to secure position against any other directional forces as necessary. After a period of time, changes in the geometry of the heart and/or fibrous adhesion between prosthesis and surrounding cardiac tissues, or between the anchor and surrounding cardiac tissues, may assist or replace the function of anchor and/or the ventricular tethers in resisting longitudinal forces on the valve prosthesis during ventricular contraction.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="2">Description of Surface Improvements Figures.</heading><p id="p-0396" num="0390">Referring now to the FIGURES, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one embodiment of a prosthetic heart valve <b>110</b> according to the present invention, comprising tubular stent <b>112</b> having optional tether attachment structures <b>114</b> at one end and tubular stent <b>112</b> provides integrated sealing cuff <b>116</b> at the other end.

This specific shape, for the prosthetic mitral valve, mimics the native valve, and takes into consideration the anterior to posterior compression or deformation that occurs due to adjacent cardiovascular tissues, and takes into consideration the lower, commissural portions similar to the native valve. Since the inventive collar is flexible and deformable, this allows proper alignment of the valve leaflets within the stent body, greatly enhancing functionality. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref> illustrates how a tricuspid valve may also be used within the scope of the present inventive subject matter.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0417">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the collar has the ability to travel or flex in and out, along the lateral axis; longitudinal defined by the lengthwise axis of the stent. As stated, this flexibility or compliance provides the prosthetic heart valve, specifically the collar, upon being deployed within a patient's heart, the ability to conform to the anatomical shape of the native annulus, maintain the conforming shape during the cardiac cycle, and provide a tight seal against the atrial tissue adjacent the mitral valve aperture. This feature reduces or removes the guesswork that often accompanies the pre-surgical sizing of a mitral valve. By providing a better fit, this necessarily prevents blood from leaking around the implanted prosthetic heart valve.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0418"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows how the prosthetic valve <b>110</b> may be fitted with a tissue covering <b>126</b> that is thin, durable, and may be attached to the stent body <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> also shows how the collar <b>116</b> may consist in one embodiment as a two-part structure consisting of flexible member <b>152</b> and support structure <b>150</b>. Circular support structure <b>140</b> may be made as a disc or halo or series of loops from the stent itself by heat-forming or by laser-cutting, or may be an independent structure that is later attached or welded. In this embodiment, flexible member may be made from a synthetic material such as an elastic polymer fabric like a surgical polyester-linked fabric known in the art. Support structure <b>150</b> may be covered with thin tissue <b>126</b> such as for example, in a non-limiting preferred embodiment, a 0.005 inch thick tissue made according to the processes disclosed herein. Leaflet cusp <b>120</b>, here shown internal to the stent <b>112</b>, may be made of the same tissue material as tissue covering <b>126</b>. In certain embodiments, leaflet tissue may be processed to provide a thicker or thinner tissue as may demanded by a particular deployment. For example, very thin tissue would be useful where the prosthetic valve is being deployed in a peripheral or non-cardiac vasculature and needs to be very small. In another embodiment, the leaflet tissue may be selected to be thicker to add stability or wear or function, for a particular use.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0419">The prosthetic valve may be sized according to the patient's cardiovascular needs.
