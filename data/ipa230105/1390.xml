Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an exhaust gas purification catalyst.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine of an automobile, a motorcycle or the like contains harmful components such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx). A three-way catalyst is used to purify and detoxify those harmful components. Noble metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) are used as a three-way catalyst. Pt and Pd are mainly involved in oxidative purification of HC and CO and Rh is mainly involved in reductive purification of NOx.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is desirable that an air-fuel ratio A/F during supply to an internal combustion engine be controlled to be near a theoretical air-fuel ratio (stoichiometry). However, since an actual air-fuel ratio swings, with a stoichiometry at a center, to a rich side (fuel-rich atmosphere) or a lean side (fuel-lean atmosphere), depending on driving conditions of a motor vehicle or the like, an air-fuel ratio of exhaust gas similarly swings to a rich or lean side. Due to this, to decrease a change in an oxygen concentration in exhaust gas and improve an exhaust gas purifying performance of a catalyst, a material having an ability to absorb oxygen when the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is high and release oxygen when the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas is low (i.e., oxygen storage capacity (OSC)) (hereinafter, may be referred to as &#x201c;OSC material&#x201d;), for example, a CeO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;ZrO<sub>2</sub>-based complex oxide, is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to harmful components such as HC, CO and NOx, exhaust gas contains particulate matter (PM), which is known as causing air pollution. For example, a gasoline direct injection engine (GDI), which is used in a vehicle equipped with a gasoline engine, is fuel-efficient and high-power, but is known to discharge a larger amount of PM in exhaust gas than a conventional gasoline port injection engine. To respond to an environmental regulation on PM, a vehicle equipped with a gasoline engine such as GDI is also required to be installed with a filter with a PM collecting function (GPF: Gasoline Particulate Filter) as in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a substrate having a structure called a wall-flow structure is used as a GPF. In the wall-flow substrate, when exhaust gas flows in from a cell inlet, passes through a porous partition wall dividing cells, and flows out from a cell outlet, PM in the exhaust gas is collected in a pore inside the partition wall.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since space for installing an exhaust gas purification catalyst is usually limited, technologies for collecting PM and purifying harmful components such as HC, CO and NOx by supporting a noble metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd and Rh on a GPF have been studies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an exhaust gas purification catalyst including a palladium-containing layer and a rhodium-containing layer, wherein the palladium-containing layer and the rhodium-containing layer are stacked so that one of the palladium-containing layer and the rhodium-containing layer is positioned inside a partition wall, while the other is positioned on a surface of the partition wall.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 2 discloses an exhaust gas purification catalyst including: an inflow-side cell, wherein only an end on an exhaust gas inflow side is open; an outflow-side cell adjacent to the inflow-side cell, wherein only an end on an exhaust gas outflow side is open; a wall-flow substrate having a porous partition wall that separates the inflow-side cell and the outflow-side cell from each other; an upstream catalyst layer provided inside the partition wall; and a downstream catalyst layer provided inside the partition wall, wherein each of the upstream and downstream catalyst layers contains a carrier and at least one noble metal selected from platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) supported on the carrier, and wherein the noble metal contained in the upstream catalyst layer is different from the noble metal contained in the downstream catalyst layer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">[Patent Document 1] JP 2009-82915 A</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">[Patent Document 2] JP 2016-78016 A</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, a conventional exhaust gas purification catalyst is insufficient in exhaust gas purifying performance (in particular, NOx purifying performance) at low to medium temperature.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an exhaust gas purification catalyst having improved exhaust gas purifying performance (in particular, improved NOx purifying performance) at low to medium temperature.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solutions to the Problems</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To achieve the object, the present invention provides an exhaust gas purification catalyst, including:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a substrate;

Examples of the substrate include a wall-flow substrate and a flow-through substrate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The material constituting the substrate can be selected as appropriate from substrate materials of conventional exhaust gas purification catalysts. Preferably, the material constituting the substrate is a material that allows the substrate to stably maintain its shape even when the substrate is exposed to high-temperature (e.g., 400&#xb0; C. or higher) exhaust gas. Examples of the material of the substrate include: ceramics such as cordierite, silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum titanate; and alloys such as stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The amount of the catalyst layer according to the present invention formed on the substrate can be appropriately adjusted in consideration of, for example, the balance between the exhaust gas purifying performance and the cost.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The catalyst layer according to the present invention contains rhodium (Rh) element, phosphorus (P) element and a rare earth element other than cerium (Ce) element. The ratio of the mass of the phosphorus element contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention to the mass of the rhodium element contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention is from 1.0 to 10, and the ratio of the mass of the rare earth element other than cerium element in terms of an oxide thereof contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention to the mass of the rhodium element contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention is from 1.0 to 5.0. These enable the exhaust gas purification catalyst according to the present invention to exhibit excellent exhaust gas purifying performance (in particular, excellent NOx purifying performance) at low to medium temperature. The exhaust gas purifying performance at low to medium temperature can be evaluated based on the light-off temperature T50. The light-off temperature T50 is a temperature at which the purification efficacy reaches 50%, and can be measured according to the conditions described in the Examples herein. As used herein, the term &#x201c;low to medium temperature&#x201d; means a temperature of from 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The catalyst layer according to the present invention contains rhodium element. The rhodium element is a catalytic active component mainly involved in reductive purification of NOx. The rhodium element is contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention, in a form that can function as a catalytic active component, for example, in a form of a rhodium metal or a compound containing rhodium element (e.g., an oxide of rhodium element). Preferably, the catalytic active component is in a form of particles, from the viewpoint of improving exhaust gas purifying performance.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The catalyst layer according to the present invention may contain a catalytic active component other than rhodium element. For example, the catalytic active component other than rhodium element can be selected from noble metal elements such as platinum (Pt) element, palladium (Pd) element, ruthenium (Ru) element, iridium (Ir) element and osmium (Os) element. A noble metal element is contained in the catalyst layer according to the present invention, in a form that can function as a catalytic active component, for example, in a form of a noble metal or a compound containing a noble metal element (e.g., an oxide of a noble metal element). Preferably, the catalytic active component is in a form of particles, from the viewpoint of improving exhaust gas purifying performance. In this regard, when the catalyst layer according to the present invention contains rhodium element and a noble metal element other than rhodium element, the rhodium element and the noble metal element other than rhodium element may form an alloy, resulting in a decrease in active sites provided by the rhodium element, which are involved in reductive purification of NOx.

Thereafter, the substrate was calcinated at 600&#xb0; C. for 2 hours in an air atmosphere. This gave an exhaust gas purification catalyst including the wall-flow substrate and the catalyst layer formed on the wall-flow substrate. The obtained catalyst layer was a single layer.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">(4) Aging Treatment</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0117">The exhaust gas purification catalyst obtained in the above (3) was subjected to the following aging treatment.
