No. 63/217,669, filed Jul. 1, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to lifting heavy objects, such as paver stones. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an apparatus for lifting and moving heavy objects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pavers are frequently used to build walkways, patios, driveways, and other surfaces. They are often chosen over poured concrete for their customizable look, durability, and ease of repair. Pavers may also come in a variety of sizes, from brick-shaped pavers to tile-shaped pavers, and may be made from stone, concrete, or other materials. Regardless of the paver used, moving and placing the pavers is a tedious task that is time-consuming and may often lead to injury. In particular, a user must frequently bend over to grasp a tile to then transport it or otherwise move it into position. The frequent bending and strain can have serious consequences for a user's back, particularly when moving and placing numerous, heavy pavers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, pavers are also difficult to grasp for lifting and are tricky to place, with fingers often getting pinched between adjacent pavers. Many users, in an effort to avoid pinched fingers, use their feet to push a paver into place after placing it near an adjacent stone in a pathway. However, this is not ideal as it can change the surface under the pavers, making them uneven.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attempts have been made to make the transportation and placement of pavers easier. However, the devices in the prior art still require a user to bend over to couple or release the paver from the device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to pavers, there are numerous heavy objects that are difficult and/or awkward for a user to lift and transport. From wire spools and pipes to railroad ties and concrete sections, there is a need for a device that allows a user to easily lift and maneuver heavy objects without bending over and without risking injury to fingers. The lifting apparatus disclosed herein solves these problems and others.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a lifting apparatus comprises a semi-rigid, spring handle (e.g., metal tubing with memory) and a scissor grip. Due to the spring nature of the handle, the scissor grip is actuated by pushing the handle downward or by lifting it upward. Each end of the scissor grip comprises a bracket for coupling to opposing edges of a heavy object. As the handle is lifted, the scissor grip actuates, squeezing and holding the object between the brackets. A user may then easily transport the object to the desired location, place the object without bending over, and may release the object from the scissor grip by pressing downward on the springing handle, thereby widening and loosening the brackets, allowing a user to pivot the lifting apparatus to release the object from the brackets.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the handle may comprise a coil spring to aid in maintaining its default position. In some embodiments, the scissor grips are actuated using a separate lever, which may or may not require a spring.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the size and configuration of the handle may vary for the intended use. Further, in some embodiments, the handle and/or scissor grips are extendable (e.g., telescopic) in length.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the width, length, and form factor of the brackets may vary to be complementary to the form of heavy objects such as pipes, lumbar, railroad ties, and I-beams.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the brackets have a first side, a second side, and a third side, wherein the third side further comprises prongs, spikes, or serrated edges for gripping heavy objects.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the lifting apparatus comprises a handle having a first end hingedly coupled to a first arm, and a second end hingedly coupled to a second arm. The first arm may further comprise a first telescoping extension arm and the second arm may further comprise a second telescoping arm. The first telescoping arm can be received in a first end or second, opposite end of the first arm. Likewise, the second telescoping end can be received in a first end or second, opposite end of the second arm. In a first configuration, the lifting apparatus grips an outer edge of an object and in a second configuration, the lifting apparatus grips an inner surface or edge of an object.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a first, gripping position lifting a paver stone;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a bottom, rear elevation view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a second, open position;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a first, gripping position;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a top, front perspective view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a second, open position;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a top plan view of a lifting apparatus;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a lifting apparatus lifting a spool;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a bottom, rear elevation view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a second, open position;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation view of a lifting apparatus with the scissor grips in a second configuration for lifting hollow objects;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a lifting apparatus comprising a spring with the scissor grips in a first, gripping position;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a front, bottom perspective view of a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration with the scissor grips in an open position;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a front, bottom perspective view of a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration with the scissor grips in a closed, gripping position;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration in a second, open position;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a top plan view of a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a user lifting a section of concrete with a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration in a first, gripping position; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a user lifting a section of concrete with a lifting apparatus with a handle of a second configuration in a first, gripping position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following descriptions depict only example embodiments and are not to be considered limiting in scope.

The lifting apparatus disclosed herein seeks to solve these and other problems. While stone pavers are used as an example, the invention is not so limited, and the lifting apparatus may be used with a variety of heavy objects.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, a lifting apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a semi-rigid, springing U-shaped handle <b>102</b> (also referred to simply as handle <b>102</b>) and a scissor grip <b>104</b>. The handle <b>102</b> is, preferably, manufactured from materials that are sufficiently stiff, yet elastic (e.g., tubular metals) such that the handle <b>102</b> will return to a default, pre-configured position after flexing by a user. In other words, the handle <b>102</b> allows for elastic deformation, but returns to its original state when force is not applied to it (i.e., memory). Due to the elastic nature of the handle <b>102</b>, the scissor grip <b>104</b> is actuated by pushing the handle <b>102</b> downward or by lifting it upward, as will be discussed later herein. In some embodiments, the scissor grip <b>104</b> comprises a first arm <b>106</b> hingedly coupled to a first end <b>108</b> of the handle <b>102</b>, such as by a first hinge pin <b>107</b>, and a second arm <b>110</b> hingedly coupled to a second end <b>112</b> of the handle <b>102</b>, such as by a second hinge pin <b>109</b>. The first arm <b>106</b> is pivotally coupled to the second arm <b>110</b> at a center hinge pin <b>114</b>. Further, the first arm <b>106</b> comprises a first bracket <b>116</b> and the second arm <b>110</b> comprises a second bracket <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first bracket <b>116</b> and the second bracket <b>118</b> each comprise a first side <b>115</b>, a second side <b>117</b>, and a third side <b>119</b>. The third side may further comprise prongs, spikes, a rubberized end, or other edges to aid in gripping objects. Further, the first bracket <b>116</b> and second bracket <b>118</b> may comprise a formfactor that is complementary to the shape of objects such as pipes, lumbar, railroad tiles, and I-beams. For example, the brackets may be rounded and concave (e.g., half-pipe shaped) for gripping a pipe.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in its default position (due to the springing handle <b>102</b>), the first end <b>108</b> and the second end <b>112</b> of the handle <b>102</b> are separated from each other by a first distance. In this position, the scissor grip <b>104</b> is in a &#x201c;cross&#x201d; configuration such that the first bracket <b>116</b> and second bracket <b>118</b> are also separated by a first distance (a &#x201c;gripping&#x201d; position). Due to the elasticity of the handle <b>102</b>, the handle <b>102</b> will assume this position when lifted by a user or when no downward force is applied on the handle <b>102</b>. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the weight of the handle <b>102</b> alone is enough to overcome the spring and cause the arms <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> to be parallel to each other and extend longitudinally in the same horizontal plane, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show an open position, with the first end <b>108</b> and second end <b>112</b> of the handle <b>102</b> separated by a second distance, the second distance being greater than the first distance. The brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are also separated by a second distance, greater than the first, and are therefore capable of extending over the edges of an object to be lifted.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Therefore, as understood, the scissor grip <b>104</b> actuates so that the first bracket <b>116</b> and second bracket <b>118</b> move closer to one another (to a distance less than the second distance), squeezing and holding (i.e., gripping) an object therebetween (e.g., paver <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, spool <b>121</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, or other objects). A user may then easily transport the object (e.g., paver <b>120</b>) to the desired location and place the object without bending over. To release the object from the grip of the first and second bracket <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, a user presses downward on the top <b>103</b> of the handle <b>102</b>, forcing the first end <b>108</b> and the second end <b>112</b> downward, which causes the first arm <b>106</b> and the second arm <b>110</b> to actuate in relation to one another at the center hinge pin <b>114</b>, with the first arm <b>106</b> and second arm <b>110</b> being positioned in substantially the same horizontal plane, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when fully actuated. In this position, the first end <b>108</b> and second end <b>112</b> are at a second distance from each other, the second distance being wider than the first distance, as mentioned above. Likewise, the first bracket <b>116</b> and second bracket <b>118</b> are at a second distance from each other, the second distance being greater than the first. As a result of the increased distance between the brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, the grip loosens, thereby allowing a user to release the object, such as paver <b>120</b>, by pivoting the handle <b>102</b> to release at least one bracket <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> from the object.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Objects may vary in overall length/size. Accordingly, the first arm <b>106</b> and/or second arm <b>110</b> may be length adjustable, such as by telescoping. For example, the first arm <b>106</b> may have a telescoping extension arm <b>122</b> and second arm <b>110</b> may have a telescoping extension arm <b>124</b>. The telescoping extension arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be secured at the desired position using spring-loaded pins <b>126</b>, set screws, locking pins, rack and gear, or any other known mechanisms for extending and retracting the length of the arms <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>. This allows a user to customize the lifting apparatus <b>100</b> for a variety of objects and object sizes. While shown with telescoping extensions <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, they are not required. However, when they are incorporated, it will be appreciated that the brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are coupled to the end of each extension <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the telescoping extension arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be received in either end of the first arm <b>106</b> and the second arm <b>110</b>, and may be secured at the desired position using spring-loaded pins <b>126</b>, set screws, locking pins, rack and gear, or any other known mechanisms for extending and retracting the length of the arms <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the telescoping extension arms <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may be received near the first hinge pin <b>107</b> and the second hinge pin <b>109</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the lifting apparatus <b>100</b> may be inserted within hollow spaces of objects such that when the lifting apparatus <b>100</b> is lifted upward and the brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> engage an inner surface or lip of the object, the scissor grip <b>104</b> actuates so that the first bracket <b>116</b> and second bracket <b>118</b> move farther apart from one another, exerting outward force on the object, thereby allowing a user to lift the object, such as a pot. Moreover, the first bracket <b>116</b> and the second bracket <b>118</b> may be configured to conform to an inner lip or edge within the hollow interior space of a heavy object such as a pot.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additionally, the handle <b>102</b> may vary in overall length, such as by being telescopic. For example, a first handle extension <b>128</b> may extend on a first side <b>130</b> and a second handle extension <b>132</b> may extend on a second side <b>134</b>. Each of the extensions may be secured at the desired position using spring-loaded pins <b>136</b>A-B or other mechanisms known in the art of pole/leg extensions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, in one method of use, a user would place a first bracket <b>116</b> on a first edge of an object, press downwardly on the top <b>103</b> of the handle <b>102</b>, thereby increasing the distance between the first and second brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> until the second bracket <b>118</b> engages the second edge of the object. With the first and second brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> on opposite sides of the object, a user may lift up on the top <b>103</b> of the handle <b>102</b> which causes the brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> to grip the object therebetween. The user may then move the object to the desired location, place the object on the ground/surface, then press downwardly on the top <b>103</b> of the handle <b>102</b> to increase the distance between the first and second brackets <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, thereby releasing the grip on the object. As a result, a user is able to lift and transport heavy objects without strain. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (paver stone), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> (spool of cable), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref> (concrete), a variety of heavy objects may be lifted and maneuvered using a lifting apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a lifting apparatus <b>200</b> comprises a handle <b>202</b> and a spring <b>204</b> exerting an inward force on a first arm end <b>206</b> and a second arm end <b>208</b>. In other words, the spring <b>204</b> may be used to pull the ends <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> inwardly to a first distance. This may be useful when additional inward force is needed to maintain a grip on an object, or for when the handle is made from non-springing materials. A user can extend the spring <b>204</b> by pressing downward on the top <b>203</b> of the handle <b>202</b>, which forces the ends <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> outwardly from one another to a second distance wider than the first distance. As the handle <b>202</b> is lifted, the spring <b>204</b> ensures a tight grip on the object by pulling the ends <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> inwardly, thereby causing the brackets <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> to grip an object therebetween. In another embodiment, not shown, the scissor grip is actuated using a separate lever, which may or may not require a spring.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, a lifting apparatus <b>300</b> comprises a first handle portion <b>302</b> hingedly coupled on a first end <b>304</b> to a first end <b>306</b> of a second handle portion <b>308</b>, such as via a first hinge pin <b>309</b>. A second end <b>310</b> of the first handle portion <b>302</b> is hingedly coupled to a first arm <b>312</b>, such as via a second hinge pin <b>311</b>. A second end <b>314</b> of the second handle portion <b>308</b> is hingedly coupled to a second arm <b>316</b>, such as via a third hinge pin <b>313</b>. The first arm <b>312</b> pivotally couples to the second arm <b>316</b> at a center hinge pin <b>318</b>. The first arm <b>312</b> comprises a first bracket <b>320</b> and the second arm comprises a second bracket <b>322</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In its default position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first and second arms <b>312</b>, <b>316</b> are in substantially the same horizontal plane. When a user lifts the second handle portion <b>308</b>, the weight of the first and second arms <b>312</b>, <b>316</b> cause them to form a &#x201c;cross&#x201d; configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In other words, each hinge point actuates. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, a user may place the first bracket <b>320</b> on a first side of an object <b>324</b> and the second bracket <b>322</b> on an opposite side of the object <b>324</b>, lift the second handle portion <b>308</b>, causing the brackets <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> to grip the object <b>324</b> therebetween, allowing a user to easily lift the object. This can be particularly beneficial when the space between the object <b>324</b> and its surroundings are sufficiently small that fingers are not capable of grasping the object <b>324</b>. In one non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref> illustrate a piece of cut concrete (object <b>324</b>) being lifted and removed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first and second arms <b>312</b>, <b>316</b> may be length adjustable so as to adjust to a gripping distance (i.e., the distance between the first bracket <b>320</b> and second bracket <b>322</b>) needed by a user. For example, the first arm <b>312</b> may comprise a first telescopic extension arm <b>326</b> and the second arm <b>316</b> may comprise a second telescopic extension arm <b>328</b>. In embodiments with a first and second telescopic arm <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, the first bracket <b>320</b> is coupled to an end of the first telescopic arm <b>326</b> and the second bracket is coupled to an end of the second telescopic arm <b>328</b>. Therefore, when a user extends the first and/or second telescopic arms <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, the distance between the first bracket <b>320</b> and the second bracket <b>322</b> increases. When a user retracts the first and/or second telescopic arms <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, the distance between the first bracket <b>320</b> and second bracket <b>322</b> decreases. Therefore, it will be understood that a user may therefore adjust the gripping distance by adjusting one or more telescopic arms <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>. As described in other embodiments, the telescopic arms <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> may be secured into position using spring-loaded pins <b>330</b> or other known mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, the lifting apparatus <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> shown and described herein solves the need in the art for an apparatus that allows a user to easily lift, transport, and place heavy objects without strain or risk of injury to fingers.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will also be appreciated that systems and methods according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure may include, incorporate, or otherwise comprise properties or features (e.g., components, members, elements, parts, and/or portions) described in other embodiments.
