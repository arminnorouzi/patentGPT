may be operated as a heat engine and/or a heat pump, includes moveable separators at a cold side and/or moveable separators at a hot side. Each separator divides a volume into two smaller volumes. Working fluid may be sequentially filled and emptied from volumes between the separators. The separators may move to maintain uniform pressure in the volumes. Hot-side separators may allow for near adiabatic compression/expansion of working fluid. Cold-side separators may allow for near adiabatic expansion/compression of working fluid. Two displacers are positioned between the cold-side separators and the hot-side separators. The displacers are independently actuatable to force working fluid into and out of the volumes between separators and into and out of a variable intermediate volume between the displacers. Heat exchangers, including a warming heat exchanger, are provided to heat, cool, and warm working fluid as it flows between separated volumes and the intermediate volume.</p></abstract><drawings

engine, such as a Stirling engine, run in the reverse direction requiring the addition of external power to operate. The techniques described herein use a source of heat energy in a unique way to provide cooling while being capable of providing heating through enhanced cogeneration and power simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present disclosure concerns apparatuses, which may be termed heat engines and/or heat pumps, which may be used to provide heating, cooling and/or produce work. An apparatus may include separators at the cold side, hot side, or both hot and cold sides to cause a working fluid to undergo near adiabatic expansion or compression, so as to improve efficiency of the apparatus's cooling, heating, and power generation. An apparatus may include primary and secondary displacers that provide for a warming volume therebetween, so that cold working fluid may be warmed and then deposited in the warming volume prior to being sent to the hot side. Further improvements and advantages of the techniques discussed herein will be apparent from the detailed description below.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example apparatus <b>100</b>.

The hot-side heat exchanger <b>110</b> may receive heat input Qh from a heat source, and the cold-side heat exchanger <b>108</b> may provide heat output Qc to a cold sink. The warming heat exchanger <b>112</b> may receive warm input Qw from a warming source that may have a temperature lower than the temperature of the heat source. In various examples, the warming source may be cooler than the cold sink, as will be discussed. Such examples may provide for enhanced cooling capacity. In other examples, the warming source may have a temperature between the temperatures of the heat source and the cold sink. In such examples, enhanced power may be extracted from the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The apparatus <b>100</b> is a closed system that contains a working fluid.

The connected piston <b>1402</b> is used to compress an external gas in a cylinder <b>1404</b>. During compression of the cylinder (warming and heating stage of the apparatus <b>500</b>), the pressure of the gas continues to rise until it is fully compressed (point <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) before being pushed out of the cylinder <b>1404</b>. Once the cylinder <b>1404</b> is emptied, the connection to high pressure side of the compression system is blocked via the output one-way valve <b>1410</b>. The working fluid inside the apparatus <b>500</b> begins to cool but initially does not change in volume (i.e., isochoric cooling) since the total force exerted on the pressure plate <b>542</b> initially exceeds the total force exerted by the cylinder gas on the piston <b>1402</b>. When the pressure inside the external cylinder <b>1404</b> drops below the pressure of the low-pressure gas (point <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>), the input one-way valve <b>1408</b> begins to open allowing new low-pressure gas to enter the cylinder <b>1404</b> at a continuous pressure (i.e., isobaric cooling).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, point <b>1</b> indicates what may be termed a cold state of the apparatus <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and described above. Consider an example in which a piston and cylinder filled with a gas is at some external pressure and waiting to be compressed.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">From point <b>1</b> to point <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is the warming stage of a thermodynamic cycle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>. During this stage in this example, low temperature heat is extracted from a location where cooling is required Qw. This is the heat pump effect that provides cooling. Many such applications exist such as the cooling of industrial equipment or the cooling of a building during the summer. In this example, heat may also be extracted by cooling a gas that is to be compressed by the apparatus itself, or by the after cooling of an external gas that has been compressed. Since the volume of the apparatus is increasing in this example, the apparatus can be used to begin the compression of an external gas in a cylinder using a piston, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. During this stage, in this example, by causing the external gas to be compressed, the low temperature heat, in addition to providing cooling is simultaneously being used to generate power. Using low temperature heat to produce power while simultaneously cooling is a useful and unique capability.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Point <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is the warm state when warming is completed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">From point <b>2</b> to point <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is the heating stage.

At this point the working fluid has reached its maximum pressure, volume, and temperature since all of the volumes are in their heated state. In this state the maximum temperature volume in the hot side may be above the heat source temperature due to near adiabatic compression of the hot gas as the pressure continues to increase. Conversely the volume of the external cylinder, having been reduced by the piston <b>1402</b> due to the expansion of the apparatus, would be at its minimum volume but maximum pressure.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Point <b>3</b> to <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is the isochoric cooling stage. As the apparatus begins the cooling stage, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, this first part of the cooling stage is isochoric or at constant volume. This may be achieved by placing a hard stop at the piston <b>1402</b> when it reaches the minimum volume such as fully emptying the cylinder <b>1404</b>. Output one-way valve <b>1410</b> prevents the displaced gas from re-entering cylinder <b>1404</b>. The pressure in the cylinder <b>1404</b> continues to decrease until it drops to the same pressure as the low-pressure gas inlet. The apparatus will not start to reduce in volume until force exerted on the power output component <b>540</b> by the external gas pressure on the piston <b>1402</b>, plus any compensating force such as a spring, is greater than the force exerted on the power output component <b>540</b> from the apparatus <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Point <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> occurs when the pressure in the cylinder <b>1404</b> drops to the pressure of the low-pressure gas inlet. At this point, the force exerted on the power output component by the pressure plate <b>542</b> becomes equal to the force exerted by the piston <b>1402</b>. This allows gas to enter the cylinder <b>1404</b> and allows the piston <b>1402</b> to move up as the apparatus <b>500</b> begins to reduce in volume.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Point <b>4</b> to <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> the cooling stage continued. At this point the pressure in the apparatus continues to drop due to the cooling of the working gas volumes. When the force caused by the pressure of the working fluid acting on a pressure plate <b>542</b> drops below the force caused by the pressure of the external gas acting on the piston <b>1402</b>, the internal volume of the apparatus <b>500</b> will decrease while the volume <b>1406</b> of the cylinder <b>1404</b> will increase until it reaches its original cycle volume at the cold state point <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">During the cooling stage, including all stages from point <b>3</b> to point <b>4</b> and point <b>4</b> to point <b>1</b>, heat may be removed from the apparatus and provided to where heat is required. This could be for heating a building. In such cases it would be considered cogeneration where heat is used to generate power with its excess used to heat a building. In this example, it may be considered &#x201c;enhanced cogeneration&#x201d; since it includes heat from the high temperature heat source and from the low temperature heat source. The heat could also be used for many other uses such as heating material as part of an industrial process.
