user's Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This results in a search page that presents results in an order and prominence that improves user understanding and information accessibility. Features from IoT devices are used to train a machine learning model that receives as an input information from an IoT entity index, the query, and results from the search engine along with their static rankings. The resultant IoT positioning scores are used to assign an initial location on the search results page. A second machine learning model trained using IoT features is then used to assign a final location on the page.

In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following overview is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Description. This overview is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In prior systems, results from a user entered query were put through several layers of static ranking to produce an ordered list of results that a user could scroll through looking for the desired information. More modern systems aggregate results from several different types of data such as web pages, news, video, shopping, maps, and so forth. The results are placed on the search results page in a manner that attempts to improve the whole page relevance of the results presented to a user. Whole page relevance defines how well the surface-level representation (e.g., format, size, relative location, and so forth) of all elements on a search result page and the corresponding holistic attributes of the presentation respond to users' information needs.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Improving whole page relevance is more than simply a better way to present information. Improving whole page relevance allows a user to access relevant information in a more efficient manner. Improving whole page relevance presents information that is more likely to be relevant in a location and in a fashion that allows a user to not only quickly locate desired information but to quickly recognize the desired information. Improving whole page relevance is a technical improvement to the search engine because it improves the efficiency of using the device by bringing together more relevant information and presenting the information in a manner and/or location that allows a user to quickly find and recognize desired information.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present disclosure improve whole page relevance by using information from and/or about a user's Internet of Things (IoT) devices to improve ranking and/or positioning of search results on the search results page prior to displaying the user. IoT devices include devices that a user owns or interacts with and that are becoming computerized and that are able to communicate over networks and/or collect data such as cars, refrigerators, furnaces, wearables, medical devices, and so forth. The user may interact with and/or be associated with many IoT devices without even being aware of it.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Data from and/or about a user's IoT devices can be collected, rationalized, and conflated with one or more search knowledge indexes to create an IoT entity index that can be used as described herein to improve whole page relevance. Data is collected and used with user consent to improve the efficiency with which a user interacts with the system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A user submits a search query to a search system. The search system produces a set of results that are relevant to the query. The results are ranked using one or more static rankers to produce a set of results, each having an associated static rank. An enhanced IoT ranker having a trained machine learning model then assigns a placement score to each of the results. The machine learning model is trained using features from and/or about the IoT devices. During the enhanced IoT ranking process, features from the IoT entity index are used in conjunction with the query and the static ranking of the answer to assign placement scores.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A positioner assigns initial page placement positions on the results page based on the position scores. An answer classifier assigns final page positions using another trained machine learning model. The system then causes display of the search results to the user.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a representative diagram <b>100</b> illustrating a prior art method of organizing search results on a search engine results page. A query <b>102</b> is submitted to a search engine <b>104</b>. Using traditional methods, the search engine identifies results <b>106</b> that are deemed relevant to the query. The results are then ranked through several layers of static rankers <b>108</b> to arrive at a final ranked list of search results. The final list is placed in rank order and are returned as a list of results <b>112</b> on a search results page <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A user is then left to page through pages of results until the desired result(s) are located. In such a prior art approach, there is no attempt to optimize the placement of results beyond the static ranking and the placement of results in rank order. Thus, this approach is not attempting to increase or even consider the whole page relevance of the search results page. In addition, all results of different types (web results, video, image, and so forth) are ranked together in the same list.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a representative diagram illustrating a representative architecture <b>200</b> of ranking and positioning search results according to some aspects of the present disclosure. This architecture represents a high-level diagram of architectures that are described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this architecture, a user submits a query <b>202</b> to a search engine <b>204</b>. The search engine uses subqueries and/or other mechanisms to identify results of different types that are relevant to the query, such as web results <b>206</b>, image results <b>208</b>, task pane results <b>210</b>, video results <b>212</b>, and so forth as indicated by the illustrated ellipses. All these types should be self-explanatory except for maybe the task pane results. Task pane results are results that are typically placed in a region of the output screen (the task pane) that remains relatively constant in terms of location but whose content in terms of type and existence is dependent on the user query and/or user context. Thus, for one query the task pane may not be used, for another the task pane may contain one type of data, and for yet another query a different mix of types of data.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ranking and positioning engine <b>214</b> takes the different type of search results that have been determined to be relevant to the query by the search engine and ranks them and determines where to place them on the search results page <b>216</b>. The ranking and positioning engine <b>214</b> utilizes one or more trained machine learning models to perform ranking and positioning as described in greater detail below. The machine learning models are trained using features of IoT devices so that ranking and positioning increases the whole page relevance of the search results page <b>216</b>. A representative training process is described below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The resultant search results page <b>216</b> has improved whole page relevance due to using IoT entity index data as described herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a representative diagram illustrating another representative architecture <b>300</b> of ranking and positioning search results according to some aspects of the present disclosure. The architecture <b>300</b> utilizes information about or from users' IoT devices <b>302</b>. These IoT devices are associated with various users and data is collected on a per user basis in many embodiments with users' permission and knowledge. As previously discussed, IoT devices <b>302</b> can comprise any devices that a user interacts with, owns, or otherwise utilizes.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Often IoT devices are thought of in a one-to-one relationship between items and IoT devices (e.g., a car is a single IoT device). However, a single item could include multiple IoT devices. For instance, a car could have an IoT device for its electrical system, an IoT device for its emission system, an IoT device for its fuel system, and so forth. Thus, a real-world implementation may include billions of IoT devices associated with millions of users and architecture <b>300</b> is configured to handle such an implementation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Architecture <b>300</b> can include and/or communicate with an IoT data collector <b>304</b>, an IoT entity collector <b>306</b>, a knowledge graph or index <b>308</b>, an IoT entity index <b>310</b>, a search engine <b>314</b>, and/or an IoT enhanced ranking and positioning engine <b>318</b>. In this example, the IoT data collector <b>304</b>, and/or IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can be part of a system which collects data about and from IoT devices and produces the IoT entity index <b>310</b> or can be part of a search system.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">IoT data collector <b>304</b> can be viewed as a central hub where sensor data from users' IoT devices <b>302</b> and or information about a user's IoT devices <b>302</b> is communicated. For instance, in an example where a user's IoT devices included a refrigerator and a car, the IoT data <b>302</b> could include &#x201c;Whirlpool ABC&#x201d; at <b>304</b>, where &#x201c;ABC&#x201d; is a contrived model of refrigerator. The IoT data could also includes &#x201c;Honda Civic&#x201d; at <b>304</b>. For sake of brevity the amount of IoT device data in the illustrated example is relatively brief. However, more extensive IoT device information could be conveyed. For instance, relative to the Honda, the IoT device data could include mileage, status of various systems, percent of oil life remaining, next projected service, and so forth. The IoT data collector can associate the IoT data with a particular user, with the user's informed consent. For example, the IoT collector could associate User<b>1</b> with both the &#x201c;Whirlpool ABC&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Honda Civic&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some cases, a client component (not specifically illustrated) can run on the IoT devices <b>302</b> and can collect information from the IoT device. The client component can send the information to the IoT data collector <b>304</b>. In some of these configurations, the client component can include a push-based notification agent. The push-based notification agent can detect changes in the state of the IoT device and/or new data to transfer and push the information to the IoT data collector <b>304</b>. The type of information about the IoT device and/or how often information changes can vary based upon device type and/or environment. For instance, a car parked in a garage may send less data and/or send the data less frequently than a car driving down the road.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Collecting a user's IoT data can implicate certain privacy issues. Thus, such data can be collected with the user's informed consent. Furthermore, embodiments of the disclosure can allow the user to customize parameters such as what data is collected, what devices the data is collected from, how long the data is utilized, and so forth. For example, the user may allow collection of information from the user's car, but not from the user's wearable device, or allow collection of the make and model of the wearable device but not location or health data.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Allowing the user to customize data collection gives the user control of the IoT enhanced ranking and positioning since, as described herein, the data drives how the ranking and positioning operates. Thus, the data customization translates into a system customization by the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although IoT data is collected by the IoT data collector, the IoT device data may not be in a form that is recognized and/or useful in a search context. Stated another way, the IoT device data may not have any value in a search context. From one perspective, the discussion that follows explains techniques for increasing the value of the IoT device data in the search context. From another perspective, one technical problem is that IoT data does not currently exist in a manner that is understood in the highly developed search context. The discussion below provides a technical solution to this problem.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">IoT entity collector <b>306</b> extracts and processes the data from IoT data collector <b>304</b>. The extraction and processing can entail multiple stages. For instance, one stage can process and ingest the IoT device data and place the data into an intermediate store. Another stage can include integration of all IoT device data across different IoT applications and/or sources to draw correlations. Another stage can entail periodically reading IoT device data from the intermediate store and store it in distributed storage. Another stage can entail deserializing the IoT device data and converting the IoT data into an indexable data format.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, the IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can analyze the IoT device data relative to entity and popularity indexes. Stated another way, this analysis can identify entities in the IoT device data. For instance, the IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can extract entity names from the IoT device data by finding matches between the IoT device data and one or more entity indexes. The IoT entity collector can also employ a popularity index relative to the IoT device data. For example, the popularity index can be populated with various entity information relating to frequency of usage, duration of usage, last time use, novelty factor, and/or brand of entity, among others. For instance, one manifestation of the popularity index can include a weighted mean of these facets. Thus, once the IoT entity collector <b>306</b> identifies an entity in the IoT device data, the IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can identify how often that entity is accessed, and so forth (e.g., what entities does the IoT device data relate to and how interested is the user in individual entities).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can utilize knowledge index <b>308</b> to derive additional information about the IoT device data. For instance, IoT entities from the IoT device data can be compared to the knowledge index <b>308</b>. Various knowledge indexes can be employed. Search engine knowledge indexes are available, for example from search services and/or search engines <b>314</b>. The process can compare entities of the IoT device data to entities of the knowledge index <b>308</b>. If an entity match is found, the existing entity ID and metadata from the knowledge index can be utilized by the IoT entity collector <b>306</b>. In an alternative case where the entity is not found, the new IoT entity from the IoT device data can added to the knowledge index <b>308</b> for future use.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">IoT entity collector <b>306</b> can also identify related entities (such as parent and/or child relationships (e.g., ontological relationships)) and metadata associated with the IoT entity using N step graph traversal over the knowledge graph <b>308</b>. Thus, in the illustrated example, the IoT entity collector <b>306</b> obtains additional information relative to the IoT device data from the IoT data collector <b>304</b>. This additional information can be viewed as structured IoT device data (e.g., the IoT device data is augmented with information about the IoT device data from knowledge index <b>308</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The structured IoT device data can be compared to the IoT device data from IoT data collector <b>304</b> for purposes of explanation. Using the refrigerator and car above as illustrative, the additional information can specify that &#x201c;Whirlpool&#x201d; is an entity of entity type &#x201c;refrigerator,&#x201d; and &#x201c;ABC&#x201d; is a model of Whirlpool refrigerator. Similarly, the additional information can specify that &#x201c;Honda&#x201d; is an entity of entity type &#x201c;car,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Civic&#x201d; is a model of Honda car. Some of this information was in the IoT device data. For instance, &#x201c;Honda&#x201d; was in the IoT device data, but without context. The knowledge index <b>308</b> provided information that &#x201c;Honda&#x201d; is an entity. Other information was not in the IoT device data and was derived from the knowledge graph. For instance, the information that the entity &#x201c;Honda&#x201d; has a child relationship to parent entity type of car was derived from the knowledge graph and added to the structured IoT device data. Thus, from one perspective, the structured IoT device data can add context to the IoT device data that makes the structured IoT device data useful or meaningful in the search context.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The structured IoT device data can be added to the IoT entity index <b>310</b>. For instance, in some implementations, the identified entities can be ingested into the IoT entity index <b>310</b> with several fields, such as user ID, entity ID, popularity index, etc. In this case, a user ID can be an anonymous unique identifier for the user. The entity ID can be the search engine knowledge base unique ID. The popularity index can be a score of relevance which is a measure of trending interest (e.g., relative trending popularity), virality, and/or usefulness. In some implementations, the structured IoT device data can be converted into an indexable data format for the IoT entity index <b>310</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an IoT entity schema for this conversion.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> above that culminates with the IoT entity index <b>310</b> explains one strategy for making users' IoT device data useful in a search context (e.g., as structured IoT device data stored in a format that allows search and retrieval). The remaining discussion relating to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> explains examples for employing the structured IoT device data in a constructive way to increase whole page relevance. In this example, the user submits the query to a search engine <b>314</b> or other search tool. The search engine <b>314</b> can provide a set of results <b>316</b> (e.g., documents, images, videos, etc.) which are relevant (e.g., contain terms of the query and/or have otherwise been identified as relevant).

The indexable data format can relate to entities in an IoT entity list <b>402</b>, to properties or attributes of the entities at <b>406</b>, and/or roles of the entities at <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one case, the IoT entity schema <b>400</b> can be employed in an index build environment for the IoT entity index.

An index as a service environment can download (e.g., stream) the chunk files generated by the index build as they are available. Periodically, the IoT entity feeds index can begin a merge process. During index merge, the index chunk files can be combined into a new, complete version of the IoT entity feeds index.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a representative diagram illustrating a representative architecture <b>500</b> of an Internet of Things enhanced ranker and positioner according to some aspects of the present disclosure. In response to a user query, a search engine identifies a set of results <b>502</b> that are relevant to the query. In some embodiments, these results comprise results of different types (web results, video, audio, image, task pane, and so forth as described). The results can be kept as groups of separate search result types.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The groups of search results are ranked using a static ranker <b>504</b> to assign a static rank score to at least a subset of results in the group. The static ranker <b>504</b> utilizes one or more layers of ranking to rank the results of the groups. These layers typically use heuristics and other methods that are developed offline. The static ranking can be performed using the static rankers typically used by search engines to rank results. In some embodiments, the static ranking can be part of the search engine.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The output <b>506</b> of the static ranker <b>504</b> is a subset (e.g., all or less than all) of results in each group, each result having an associated static rank, also referred to as a static score. In other words, in some embodiments the static ranker may drop some results out of a group.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The output <b>506</b> of the static ranker <b>504</b> is presented to an enhanced IoT ranker <b>508</b>, along with the input query in some embodiments. The enhanced IoT ranker <b>508</b> assigns an initial positioning score (also referred to as an enhanced IoT rank or enhanced IoT score) based on IoT features from the IoT entity index <b>520</b>. Thus, the output <b>510</b> of the enhanced IoT ranker <b>508</b> is a subset of results that have associated initial positioning scores that account for IoT features. At this point in the process the group of results can be kept separate in groups according to result type, or the results in one or more groups can be merged, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The initial ranking scores are then used by a positioner <b>512</b> to assign initial positions on a search results page to at least a subset of results. Thus, the output <b>514</b> of the positioner <b>512</b> are results that have been assigned to locations on the search results page. Not all results may be assigned a position on the search results page. Thus, some results can be dropped by the positioner <b>512</b>. The positioner can account for the different regions on the search results page where results are to be assigned. Other criteria can be used to assign results to a location on a search page. For example, one region of a search results page may be reserved for a particular type of results (e.g., image results) and the results (e.g., images) can be assigned to a location in the region by positioning score (e.g., highest scores on the left).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The output <b>514</b> of the positioner <b>512</b> can be sent to a result experience classifier <b>516</b> for final ranking and positioning.

The output <b>518</b> can go to a compositor or other component or system that creates the search results page and sends it to a device for display to the user.

In some example embodiments, trained machine learning models, also referred to as machine-learning algorithms or tools, are utilized to perform operations associated with feature generation, ranking, position score determination, and other functions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms, also referred to herein as models or tools, that may learn from existing data and make predictions about new data. Such machine-learning tools operate by building a model from example training data <b>712</b> in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs or assessments <b>720</b>. Although example embodiments are presented with respect to a few machine-learning models, the principles presented herein may be applied to other machine-learning models.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some example embodiments, different machine-learning models may be used.

Classification problems, also referred to as categorization problems, aim at classifying items into one of several category values (for example, is this object an apple or an orange). Regression algorithms aim at quantifying some items (for example, by providing a numerical value). In some embodiments, example machine-learning models provide a positioning score (e.g., a numeric) to identify where results should be placed on a search results page to improve the whole page relevance.

A feature <b>702</b> is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed. The concept of a feature is related to that of an explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression. Choosing informative, discriminating, and independent features is important for effective operation of the MLP in pattern recognition, classification, and regression. Features may be of different types, such as numeric features, strings, and graphs.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one example embodiment, the features <b>702</b> may be of different types of things that are about and/or are from IoT devices.

Additionally, these feature can include other information such as the popularity of an IoT device, a measure of importance of an IoT device, and so forth. Other information can also be used as features such as the query, the static rank for a result, the associated result, information about the result, and/or any other information that will be input into the trained machine learning model. As an example, when the function of the machine learning model is to select IoT features that will be input into another machine learning model (e.g., IoT features generator <b>610</b>), then the query will be a feature used in training.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The machine-learning models utilize the training data <b>712</b> to find correlations among the identified features <b>702</b> that affect the outcome or assessment <b>720</b>.

For example, suppose the following features have been gathered with the user's knowledge and consent and placed into the IoT entity index:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0091">Audi, Q5, 2017, 10,763 miles (e.g., the user's car make, model, year, and mileage);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0092">Amazon, Echo, 2016 (e.g., the user's home automation hub make, model, and year of manufacture);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0093">Trend Insights, Lynx, 2015 (e.g., the user's home security camera make, model, and year of manufacture);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0094">Rachio, Rachio 3 (e.g., the user's smart sprinkler system make and model).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0084" num="0095">As the static ranked search results are re-ranked and positioned by the IoT enhanced ranking and positioning mechanisms disclosed herein, the system can increase the ranking and positioning of results by accounting for the IoT information. For example, the feature generator in the IoT enhanced ranker can select as features those related to the user's car: (make, model, year, miles). The values (Audi, Q5, 2017, 10,763 miles) can then be used as feature vectors for the relevant search results to derive placement scores for the results. Thus, the trained machine learning model can identify higher placement for results like Audi dealers, the type of service related to the number of miles on the car, locations where warranty service can be performed, and so forth. Thus, the system is able to improve the whole page relevance for the results presented to the user.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example Machine Architecture and Machine-Readable Medium</heading><p id="p-0085" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a representative machine architecture suitable for implementing the systems and other aspects disclosed herein or for executing the methods disclosed herein.
