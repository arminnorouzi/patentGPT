One class of HVAC systems, variable refrigerant flow systems, may perform this same refrigeration cycle at intermediate speeds during partial-load conditions, allowing for efficiency gains compared to conventional systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These systems may implement multiple linked units to provide coverage for larger areas and allow for more added control of refrigerant conditions between zones. The complexity of such systems requires distributed controllers that are networked together in order to achieve the improved system control. To operate over such a network, each unit on the network must have a unique address to facilitate proper communication. Manual configuration of each unit address can be difficult and time-intensive, especially with many controllers in unknown or physically inaccessible locations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to certain embodiments, a system comprises a primary unit and a plurality of secondary units which each have a unique unit number. The primary unit is configured to communicate a first command with instructions to reply during a time window to each secondary unit, receive a reply communication indicating the secondary unit's unique unit number from at least one of the secondary units, and determine an address to assign to the secondary unit based at least in part on the unique unit number received from the secondary unit's reply.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to communicate the assigned address to the corresponding secondary unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to display a number of secondary units for which the primary unit maintains an associated address. In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to communicate a second command with instructions to reply during a second time window, receive a reply communication indicating the secondary unit's unique unit number from at least one of the secondary units that has not been assigned an address, and determine an address to assign to the secondary unit based at least in part on the unique unit number received from the secondary unit's reply.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the secondary unit is configured to calculate a time slot within the time window and to send the reply communication within the time slot. In some embodiments, the secondary unit is configured to determine not to reply to the first command if the secondary unit already has an assigned address. In some embodiments, the unique unit number is the secondary unit's serial number.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the system comprises a heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the primary unit comprises a controller communicatively coupled to the system via a network, and the secondary unit comprises a refrigeration component and a controller communicatively coupled to the system via a network.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to communicate an HVAC-related configuration to one of the secondary units using the assigned address. The secondary unit to which the HVAC-related configuration is addressed is further configured to use the HVAC-related configuration to perform an HVAC-related operation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to detect a bus contention based on receiving a reply communication from a first secondary unit and a reply communication from a second secondary unit during a same time slot within the time window. Based on detecting the bus contention, the primary unit determines not to assign an address to the first secondary unit. The primary unit is further configured to communicate a second command comprising a second instruction to reply during a second time window to the first secondary unit, receive a second reply communication indicating the first secondary unit's unique unit number from the first secondary unit that does not cause a bus contention in response to the second command, and determine an address to assign to the first secondary unit based at least in part on the unique unit number received from the first secondary unit's reply.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the primary unit is further configured to receive a first reply communication from a first secondary unit, perform a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the first reply communication, and detect an error with the first reply communication based on the CRC. Based on detecting the error with the first reply communication, the primary unit determines not to assign an address to the first secondary unit. The primary unit is further configured to communicate a second command comprising a second instruction to reply during a second time window to the first secondary unit, receive a second reply communication from the first secondary unit in response to the second command that passes the CRC and indicates the first secondary unit's unique unit number, and determine an address to assign to the first secondary unit based at least in part on the unique unit number received from the first secondary unit's reply.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Certain embodiments may provide one or more technical advantages. As an example, certain embodiments provide advantages over manual configuration of unit addresses on a network. Such a system may save time and physical toll from moving between units in order to manually assign each address to each unit on a network. As another example, certain embodiments may also have the advantage of making it easier for a technician to identify all units communicatively coupled to the system. As another example, certain embodiments may be advantageous for performing software upgrades on already-installed systems. As another example, certain embodiments may also have the advantage of making it easier to add new units to an existing system because the newly added unit may be assigned an address when coupled to the network by broadcasting another command from the primary unit on the network.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Certain embodiments may include all, some, or none of the above-described advantages.

As an example, an HVAC system configured to perform air conditioning functionality may lower the temperature and remove humidity from the conditioned space. The HVAC system may achieve this desirable effect by employing a refrigeration cycle. By compressing a refrigerant and circulating the compressed refrigerant through the HVAC system, usually first through a condenser, then through an expansion valve, and lastly through an evaporator before returning to the compressor, cooling may be achieved within the conditioned space. One type of HVAC system, known as a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system, operates using the same refrigeration cycle but may adjust the temperature and rate of cooling by adjusting the rate at which refrigerant is compressed and cycled through the system. This is unlike conventional HVAC systems which regulate the cooling rate by simple on/off operation. By operating only at the needed refrigerant flow rate, VRF systems may allow for more desirable conditioned spaced by providing more steady conditioned air and doing so more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Larger VRF systems may utilize multiple refrigeration units in order to provide greater thermal influence over a space and also to provide more selective heat transfer between various spaces. In some systems, there may be an outdoor unit linked to at least one indoor unit. In especially large systems, multiple outdoor units may be linked together along with their associated indoor units to form a single connected system. For these larger systems, each unit may have its own controller to set the HVAC-configurations for that individual unit. These multiple controllers may all be communicatively coupled via a network to allow for more complete control over the entire system rather than on a unit-by-unit basis. For example, the network may be facilitated by connecting the controllers using a balanced multipoint connection, such as RS485 serial cables. To provide appropriate communication between coupled units, each unit must have a unique address so that HVAC-related configurations may be communicated to specific units to distribute the desired overall HVAC configuration. For example, the HVAC related configuration may be software, firmware, and/or one or more parameter settings. Rather than manually assign each address to each unit and provide the assigned addresses to the primary unit, the networked units may reply with a unique unit number for each unit and then be assigned an address from the primary unit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system including a plurality of units communicatively coupled to a network.

In particular embodiments, primary unit <b>101</b> may perform all of the steps of method <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, primary unit <b>101</b>A initiates method <b>400</b> in step <b>402</b>. In step <b>402</b> the primary unit <b>101</b>A communicates a command to every secondary unit <b>110</b> by broadcasting the command with instructions for the unaddressed secondary units <b>110</b> to reply during a time window. For example, primary unit <b>101</b>A may use address 00h to broadcast instructions to secondary units <b>110</b>. If system <b>100</b> includes multiple primary units <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, and <b>101</b>C, each primary unit may be configured to address its respective secondary units <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, and <b>120</b>. As an example, each primary unit <b>101</b> may assign addresses from an address pool (e.g., 1-n) that is based on the maximum number of secondary units per primary unit <b>101</b> along with a unique prefix associated with the respective primary unit <b>110</b> (e.g., primary unit <b>101</b>A may assign addresses A<sub>1-n </sub>and primary unit <b>101</b>B may assign addresses B<sub>1-n</sub>). Alternatively, in some embodiments, primary unit <b>101</b>A may be configured to manage addressing for all of the secondary units <b>110</b>, <b>115</b>, and <b>120</b> of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the length of the time window communicated in step <b>402</b> may be based at least in part on the number of secondary units <b>110</b> being configured by primary unit <b>101</b>A. For example, as discussed below, each secondary unit <b>110</b> may respond during a respective time slot within the time window. In certain embodiments, the beginning of the time slot is based on the equation X+K*N, wherein X is an initial wait time, K is a scaling factor, and N is a random number. In certain embodiments, X may be selected to delay responses in order to allow primary unit <b>101</b> and/or secondary units <b>110</b> processing time to prepare for the next steps and/or to cause the responses to align with a time slot boundary. In certain embodiments, X may be a value between 1 ms and 20 ms, such as 10 ms. In certain embodiments, K may be configured based on the duration of a slot or the amount of time required to process a response in order to space the timing of the responses from multiple secondary units <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, K may be a value between 1 and 100, such as 50. In certain embodiments, N may be a random number selected by the secondary unit <b>110</b>. The pool of numbers from which N is selected may be large enough to reduce the likelihood of many secondary units <b>110</b> selecting the same value for N, but small enough to avoid prolonged response time. In certain embodiments, N may be a number between 0 and the maximum number of secondary units <b>110</b> capable of being addressed by primary unit <b>101</b>. For example, if primary unit <b>101</b>A is configured to address sixty four secondary units <b>110</b>, N may be a random number between 0-63. The time window communicated in step <b>402</b> may be configured to allow a secondary unit <b>110</b> an opportunity to reply in the last available time slot (e.g., X+K*63).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, in step <b>404</b> the primary unit <b>101</b> may receive a reply communications from secondary units <b>110</b>. Each reply communication indicates the replying secondary unit <b>110</b>'s unique unit number. In certain embodiments, the unique unit number corresponds to a unique serial number of secondary unit <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">After receiving the unique unit number of a secondary unit <b>110</b> in step <b>404</b> the primary unit <b>101</b> may error-check the reply communication in step <b>406</b>. For example, the primary unit <b>101</b> may perform a cyclic redundancy check. If there was an error in the reply communication from the secondary unit <b>110</b>, then the primary unit <b>101</b> may send a second command to all of the secondary units <b>110</b> by returning to step <b>402</b>. If there was no error, the method may proceed to step <b>408</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>408</b> the primary unit <b>101</b> may also determine if there were two secondary units <b>110</b> which replied during the same time slot. Two secondary units <b>110</b> replying during the same time slot could lead to a bus contention and improper address assignment. If there were two secondary units <b>110</b> that replied simultaneously, then the primary unit <b>101</b> may send a second command to all of the secondary units <b>110</b> by returning to step <b>402</b>. Otherwise, the method may proceed to step <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>410</b> if there were not multiple reply communications received simultaneously and there was no error in the reply communication, then the primary unit <b>101</b> may determine an address to assign to the replying secondary unit <b>110</b> from step <b>404</b>. The determined address to be assigned to the replying secondary unit <b>110</b> may be based on the unique unit number received from the secondary unit <b>110</b>. For example, if the unique unit number does not yet have an assigned address then the primary unit <b>101</b> may assign that secondary unit <b>110</b> an address. In certain embodiments, addresses may be selected sequentially from the available addresses. For example, a secondary device <b>110</b> replying in the earliest time slot would receive address 01h, a secondary device <b>110</b> replying in the next time slot would receive address 02h, a secondary device <b>110</b> replying in the next time slot after that would receive address 03h, and so on. Alternatively, addresses may be selected randomly from any of the available addresses. After assigning an address to a particular secondary unit <b>110</b>, the primary unit <b>101</b> may associate that unique unit number with the assigned address and remove the assigned address from the pool of addresses available to be assigned.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain embodiments, in step <b>412</b> the primary unit <b>101</b> may communicate the assigned address to the corresponding secondary unit <b>110</b>. The communication assigning the address may include the unique unit number or other unique information, such as a unique header or other field received in the reply message of step <b>404</b>, so that each secondary unit <b>110</b> can determine its corresponding assignment message. All future communicates directed to this individual secondary unit <b>110</b> may be communicated using the assigned address now associated with that secondary unit <b>110</b>. After the expiration of the time window in step <b>414</b>, the primary unit <b>101</b> may determine whether every secondary unit <b>110</b> on system <b>100</b> has an assigned address. The primary unit <b>101</b> may repeat method <b>400</b> if there are still secondary units <b>110</b> without an assigned address. In some embodiments, primary unit <b>101</b> may automatically determine the number of secondary units <b>110</b> (e.g., based on a parameter configuration or a detection procedure) and may repeat the process until each secondary unit <b>110</b> has been assigned an address (or until primary unit <b>101</b> has performed a maximum number of rounds attempting to assign the addresses). In some embodiments, primary unit <b>101</b> displays the assigned addresses to a user and the user may initiate another round of method <b>400</b> if primary unit <b>101</b> does not display that it has an assigned address for all of the secondary units <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of operation from the perspective of a secondary unit <b>110</b>. In particular embodiments, secondary unit <b>110</b> may perform all of the steps of method <b>500</b>. In some embodiments, secondary unit <b>110</b> may initiate method <b>500</b> in step <b>502</b>. In step <b>502</b> the secondary unit <b>110</b> receives a command from the primary unit <b>101</b>. The command comprises instructions to reply during a time window. For example, the command may be received on the broadcast address 00h intended for all units on system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the instructions in step <b>502</b> to reply during a time window may specify instructions for selecting a time slot within the time window. The instructions for selecting a time slot within the time window may be based at least in part on the number of secondary units <b>110</b> on system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain embodiments, in step <b>504</b> the secondary unit <b>110</b> may determine if it has already been assigned an address. If the secondary unit <b>110</b> already has an assigned address then the secondary unit <b>110</b> may end the method <b>500</b>. For example, a secondary unit <b>110</b> may already have an assigned address if method <b>500</b> has been previously performed or if an address had been manually entered by a user. If the secondary unit <b>110</b> does not already have an address in step <b>504</b> then it may continue to step <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain embodiments, in step <b>506</b> the secondary unit <b>110</b> may calculate a time slot within the time window based on the received instructions from the primary unit <b>101</b> in step <b>502</b> (or, in certain alternative embodiments, based on rules maintained by secondary unit <b>110</b>). The time slot may be a fractional amount of time during the time window. For example, for a system <b>100</b> with sixty-four secondary units <b>110</b> on network <b>102</b> coupled to primary unit <b>101</b>, the time slot may be one sixty-fourth of the time window instructed by primary unit <b>101</b> (e.g., the time slot may be calculated as X+K*N ms where N is a random number from 0 to 63) to reduce the number of potential bus contentions resulting from multiple secondary units <b>110</b> replying simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, in step <b>508</b> the secondary unit <b>110</b> would reply to the primary unit <b>101</b> with its unique unit number in the reply communication payload during the time slot calculated in step <b>506</b>. For example, the unique unit number included in the reply communication payload may be the unit's serial number. In step <b>510</b> the secondary unit <b>110</b> may receive a communication for the primary unit <b>101</b> with an address assignment intended to be used as the address of that secondary unit <b>110</b> for all future communications. The secondary unit <b>110</b> may save this address assignment in memory <b>210</b>/<b>310</b> to be used to receive future communications from the primary unit <b>101</b> at that address.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of operating example multi-unit HVAC systems. In some embodiment, primary unit <b>101</b> may initiate step <b>602</b> and broadcast a command to all secondary units <b>110</b> with instructions to reply to the primary unit <b>101</b> during a time window. For example, primary unit <b>101</b> may broadcast instructions using address 00h to all units on system <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the instructions to reply during a time window may include instructions to select a time slot during the time window. The time slot may be a fractional amount of time based at least in part on the number of secondary units <b>110</b> on system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In certain embodiments, in step <b>604</b> each secondary unit <b>110</b> may check its memory <b>210</b> or <b>310</b> to see if it has already been assigned an address primary unit <b>101</b>. For example, a secondary unit <b>110</b> may already have an assigned address if method <b>600</b> has been previously performed or if an address had been manually entered by a user. In step <b>606</b>, if the secondary unit <b>110</b> has already been assigned an address from the primary unit <b>101</b> then it may determine not to send a reply communication to the primary unit <b>101</b> in step <b>612</b>. However, in step <b>606</b>, if the secondary unit <b>110</b> has not already been assigned an address from the primary unit <b>101</b> then it may proceed to step <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>608</b>, the secondary unit <b>110</b> may select a time slot within the time window from the primary unit's instructions in step <b>602</b>. The time slot may be a fractional amount of time during the time window. For example, for a system <b>100</b> with sixty-four secondary units <b>110</b> on network <b>102</b> coupled to primary unit <b>101</b>, the time slot may be one sixty-fourth of the time window instructed by primary unit <b>101</b> (e.g., the time slot may be calculated as X+K*N ms where N is a random number from 0 to 63) to reduce the number of potential bus contentions resulting from multiple secondary units <b>110</b> replying simultaneously. In some embodiments, the secondary unit <b>110</b> would pick the time slot within the time window at random. The random selection may be accomplished by implementing a computation random number generator using processing circuitry <b>220</b>/<b>320</b> or a pseudorandom number generator. In some embodiments, the serial number associated with the device may be used as a seed value for the random number computation algorithm. In certain embodiments, in step <b>610</b> the secondary units <b>110</b> may all, after selecting a time slot within the time window, reply to the primary unit <b>101</b> during their selected time slot within the time window. In some embodiments, the secondary unit <b>110</b>'s reply payload may contain the secondary unit's unique unit number.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain embodiments, in step <b>614</b> when the primary unit <b>101</b> receives a reply containing the unique unit number from a single secondary unit <b>110</b> during a single time slot within the time window, the primary unit <b>101</b> may save the responding secondary unit's unique unit number to memory <b>210</b>/<b>310</b>. In step <b>616</b>, the primary unit <b>101</b> may determine an address to assign to the unique unit number. The address may be selected from the remaining available addresses and may be assigned in any order (e.g., sequentially, randomly, etc.). In step <b>616</b> the primary unit <b>101</b> may also communicate the assigned address to the respective secondary unit <b>110</b> that replied and is now associated with the assigned address. For example, when the primary unit <b>101</b> receives a reply from secondary unit <b>110</b>B with serial number IDU_002 the primary unit <b>101</b> may save the serial number to memory <b>210</b>/<b>310</b> and then send an assign command to that secondary unit <b>110</b>B with the first available address 01h, when the primary unit <b>101</b> receives a reply from secondary unit <b>110</b>A with serial number IDU_001 the primary unit may save the serial number to memory <b>210</b>/<b>310</b> and then send an assign command to that secondary unit <b>110</b>A with the next available address 02h, when the primary unit <b>101</b> receives a reply from secondary unit <b>110</b>C with serial number IDU_003 the primary unit may save the serial number to memory <b>210</b>/<b>310</b> and then send an assign command to that secondary unit <b>110</b>C with the next available address 03h, continuing in this fashion until all of the secondary units <b>110</b> have replied or the time window expires. In step <b>614</b>, if the primary unit <b>101</b> receives replies from two or more secondary units <b>110</b> in the same time slot (e.g., bus contention) and/or receives any replies which do not pass a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) then the primary unit may ignore those replies.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain embodiments, in step <b>618</b> a determination may be made as to whether all of the secondary units <b>110</b> on system <b>100</b> have been assigned an address. This determination may be made by the primary unit <b>101</b> or by user selection after primary unit <b>101</b> displays the number of secondary units <b>101</b> with assigned addresses. For example, the primary unit <b>101</b> may detect that the number of secondary units <b>110</b> coupled to the system <b>100</b> is greater than the number of secondary units <b>110</b> for which the primary unit <b>101</b> maintains an associated address or by the primary unit <b>101</b> failing to receive a reply from each unassigned secondary unit <b>110</b> within the time window. If there are still secondary units <b>110</b> that do not have an assigned address, for instance if they replied simultaneously resulting in a bus contention, or if the message contained an error detected by the CRC, then the primary unit <b>101</b> may reinitiate method <b>600</b>. To reinitiate method <b>600</b>, primary unit <b>101</b> broadcasts a second command by returning to step <b>602</b>. The second command includes a second time window. This loop of method <b>600</b> may continue until all secondary units <b>110</b> have been assigned an address. In some embodiments, the primary unit <b>101</b> may perform a predetermined maximum number for rounds of address assignment. If there any secondary unit <b>110</b> on the system <b>100</b> remains without an assigned address after the maximum number of rounds, the primary unit <b>101</b> may notify a user that there is an error. With every successive loop of method <b>600</b> the probability of a potential bus contentions from simultaneous replies from secondary units <b>110</b> may decrease because as more secondary units <b>110</b> received their assigned addresses, fewer units may be replying during the time window.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to any of the methods disclosed herein.
