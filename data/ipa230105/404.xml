The measurer <b>120</b> may use a battery in the apparatus <b>1</b> for estimating bio-information as a current source or may use power of an external device connected by wire or wirelessly to the apparatus <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model by analyzing a correlation between the bio-impedance, measured from the user's body part, and a variety of bio-information to be estimated. The processor <b>200</b> may estimate bio-information based on the bio-impedance by using the generated estimation model. In particular, by further using user characteristic information including at least one of a user's gender, age, stature, and weight in addition to the bio-impedance, the processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model personalized for each user. The bio-information estimation model may be expressed as a linear function, but is not limited thereto and may be defined as various nonlinear functions such as a logarithmic function and the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, the processor <b>200</b> may generate a free fatty acid estimation model by analyzing a correlation between bio-impedance and free fatty acid, and may obtain a free fatty acid concentration based on the bio-impedance by using the generated free fatty acid estimation model.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating blood fatty acid levels of three subjects FFA<b>01</b>, FFA<b>02</b>, and FFA<b>03</b> which are measured in a blood test, in which the X axis denotes a time domain including a plurality of measurement time indexes, and the Y axis denotes free fatty acid (FFA) levels in blood at each measurement time. A first measurement (i.e., measurement index <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) shows fatty acid levels measured in a fasting state after fasting for 12 hours or more, and a second measurement (i.e., measurement index <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) shows fatty acid levels measured one hour after food intake when the first measurement is complete. The measurements from the second measurement to a seventh measurement show fatty acid levels measured at one hour intervals without food intake. It can be seen that the fatty acid levels measured after fasting for 12 hours or more are much greater than the second test performed after a meal, and immediately after the meal, the fatty acid levels decrease sharply, and then increase again three hours after the meal.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally, when the body lacks energy after fasting or skipping a meal, or when the body requires energy after exercise and the like, the triglyceride (TG) breaks down into fatty acids and glycerol in the mitochondria of fat cells. The triglyceride (TG) is composed of one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids. In this case, the hydrolyzed fatty acids, which are also referred to as free fatty acids, are hydrolyzed in fat cells to pass through blood vessels, and then are transported to each body tissue, e.g., muscle and the like, which requires energy for use in generating an energy source. The transported free fatty acids are oxidized in the mitochondria to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a final source of energy.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The free fatty acids are electrically nonpolar and hydrophobic, and the free fatty acids transported to the body tissue are also present in the interstitial tissue fluid or the interstitial fluid while the free fatty acids are transported to tissue cells. The fatty acid concentration and the fatty acid variation in the tissue fluid are almost equal to the fatty acid concentration and the fatty acid variation in blood.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Based on a relationship between the free fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid and the free fatty acid concentration in blood, and the measurement value of the bio-impedance, the processor <b>200</b> may obtain the free fatty acid concentration in blood. For example, by analyzing a correlation between the bio-impedance and the free fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid, the processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model for estimating the free fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid, and may obtain the free fatty acid concentration in blood based on the estimated free fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid. Alternatively, by analyzing a correlation between the bio-impedance, the free fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid, and the free fatty acid concentration in blood, the processor <b>200</b> may generate a model for estimating the free fatty acid concentration in blood directly from the bio-impedance, and may obtain the free fatty acid concentration in blood directly from the bio-impedance by using the generated model.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Generally, in bio-impedance measurement, a difference between an amount of tissue water (body water) and electrical conductivity for compositions is output as an electrical resistance value. The tissue fluid is composed of ionized electrolyte, organic acid, etc., and is maintained at a constant concentration by homeostasis. Tissue fluid composition is polar and hydrophilic, such that there is almost no change in electrical resistance according to the type of composition. There may be a difference in electrical resistance of the tissue fluid between individual users according to each individual's characteristics (e.g., obesity, muscularity, etc.), but the electrical resistance of the tissue fluid of each individual does not change abruptly in a short period due to homeostasis. The free fatty acids hydrolyzed in fat cells and transported to body tissue/tissue fluid are nonpolar and hydrophobic, such that the electrical resistance increases with an increase in free fatty acid concentration. Accordingly, while there is almost no change in electrical resistance of the tissue fluid due to homeostasis, the fatty acid is a principal substance that causes a change in electrical resistance of the tissue fluid.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating a change in bio-impedance according to a change in fatty acid concentration in the tissue fluid, in which the X axis denotes a time domain including a plurality of measurement time indexes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a diagram illustrating a correlation between bio-impedance and free fatty acid. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, a change in fatty acid concentration may be a main cause of a change in electrical resistance of the tissue fluid, such that there is a high correlation between a change in fatty acid concentration and a change in bio-impedance. As the free fatty acid is a main cause of the change in electrical resistance of the tissue fluid, and there is a high correlation between the fatty acid in the tissue fluid and the fatty acid in blood, such that by measuring a free fatty acid concentration and/or a free fatty acid variation in the tissue fluid based on bio-impedance, the free fatty acid concentration and/or the free fatty acid variation in blood may be measured.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example, based on a correlation between the free fatty acid concentration, a fat level (e.g., an amount of an accumulated fat, a hydrolyzed fat, a consumed fat, or fat cells), or accumulated or consumed calories, and calories that turn into energy (hereinafter &#x201c;burned calories&#x201d;), the processor <b>200</b> may obtain the fat level or the accumulated or consumed calories in real time or during a predetermined period of time. The term &#x201c;consumed calories&#x201d; may refer to the calories that have been consumed by a body. The term &#x201c;accumulated calories&#x201d; may refer to the calories that remain in the body after burning some of the consumed calories. That is, when the body requires energy after fasting/skipping a meal, exercise, etc., triglycerides are hydrolyzed in the fat cells to use fatty acids as a source of energy, such that by measuring the free fatty acid concentration or the free fatty acid variation in real time or during a predetermined period time, the processor <b>200</b> may obtain the fat level in real time or during a predetermined period of time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, by using a free fatty acid estimation model that defines a correlation between the bio-impedance and the free fatty acid concentration, the processor <b>200</b> may first estimate the free fatty acid concentration, and may obtain the fat level based on the estimated free fatty acid concentration. Alternatively, based on a correlation between the bio-impedance, the free fatty acid concentration, and the fat level or the burned calories, the processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model for obtaining the fat level or the accumulated or consumed calories based on the bio-impedance, and may obtain the fat level or the accumulated or consumed calories directly from the bio-impedance.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another example, the processor <b>200</b> may estimate a triglyceride concentration based on the bio-impedance by using a correlation between the free fatty acid concentration and the triglycerides. Generally, the free fatty acid is hydrolyzed from triglycerides in fat cells, and the triglyceride is composed of one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids, such that the processor <b>200</b> may estimate the triglyceride concentration based on the free fatty acid concentration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating a change in impedance according to a change in triglyceride, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating a correlation between triglyceride and impedance. If there is a large amount of hydrolyzed fatty acids, the amount of triglycerides used increases, and the amount of triglycerides in tissue decreases, such that the fatty acids and the triglycerides have a negative correlation, and the bio-impedance and the triglycerides have a negative correlation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">By using the correlation, the processor <b>200</b> may estimate a free fatty acid concentration based on the bio-impedance, and may predict a triglyceride concentration from the estimated free fatty acid concentration. Alternatively, the processor <b>200</b> may obtain the triglyceride directly from the bio-impedance by generating a triglyceride estimation model that indicates a correlation between the bio-impedance and the triglyceride concentration, and by using the generated estimation model.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another example, the processor <b>200</b> may estimate various blood test markers, such as uric acid, creatinine, cholesterol, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), blood glucose, hematocrit (Hct), plasma protein, and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are diagrams respectively illustrating a correlation between bio-impedance and uric acid and a correlation between bio-impedance and creatinine. The processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model by analyzing a correlation between bio-impedance and a blood test marker by using regression analysis and the like, and may estimate a blood test marker by using the generated estimation model. In this case, by further using user characteristic information including at least one of a user's gender, age, stature, weight, etc., the processor <b>200</b> may generate the estimation model for estimating the blood test marker by regression analysis of the information.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, by using a correlation between each bio-information to be estimated and bio-impedance measured from a body part that is highly correlated with each bio-information to be estimated, the processor <b>200</b> may generate an estimation model for each bio-information, and may estimate each bio-information by using the estimation model. Generally, the breakdown of fatty acids actively occurs in the stomach having a small amount of muscle and a large amount of fat tissue, such that the free fatty acids and triglycerides have a high correlation with an abdomen impedance, and uric acid and creatinine have a high correlation with impedance of a highly muscular body part, such as an upper body (e.g., a torso), an arm, a leg, and the like.
