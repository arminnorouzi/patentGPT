U.S. Published Pat. App. No. 2010/0296949 is incorporated by reference herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a power unit or pneumatic drive motor system <b>1010</b> according to another example form of the invention. Pressurized air or other high-pressure drive fluid is delivered from the pressure boost tank <b>1012</b>, or alternatively from a compressor or other high-pressure drive fluid source, at a pressure designated the &#x201c;supply&#x201d; or &#x201c;high&#x201d; pressure. A pressure regulator <b>1014</b> in the high-pressure fluid supply line <b>1016</b> maintains the delivery pressure and flow within specified parameters. The high-pressure drive fluid is delivered to the intake or supply manifold <b>1018</b>, where it is distributed to one or more supply side pressure air lines <b>1020</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the pneumatic drive motor is a modified six-cylinder internal combustion engine <b>1022</b> having six pistons reciprocatingly mounted within cylinders in the engine block, and the supply manifold <b>1018</b> distributes high-pressure drive fluid to six supply side pressure air lines <b>1020</b>. In alternate embodiments, single-cylinder, two-cylinder, four-cylinder, eight-cylinder, ten-cylinder, twelve-cylinder, and other arrangements are within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The supply side pressure air lines <b>1020</b> deliver high-pressure drive fluid to the cylinders of the pneumatic drive motor <b>1022</b> in a delivery sequence controlled by air solenoid injectors <b>1024</b>. Optionally, an electronic timing device <b>1026</b> such as a programmed computer controls the actuation sequence of the air solenoid injectors to open and close in a specified sequence to drive the pistons and thereby turn the crankshaft of the engine according to a two-stroke or four-stroke cycle, and output rotational drive power to the engine's driveshaft <b>1030</b>. A starter subassembly is optionally provided, comprising an electrical starter motor <b>1040</b>, starter solenoid <b>1042</b>, starter switch <b>1044</b> and battery <b>1046</b>, for initiating the operation of the drive motor in similar fashion to that of starting an internal combustion engine of an automobile. The high-pressure drive fluid introduced to the cylinders of the pneumatic drive motor drives the pistons within the cylinders in similar fashion to that of the combustion gasses driving the cylinders of a standard internal combustion driven motor. The driveshaft output can be used to power an electrical generator G, to drive the drivetrain of an automobile or other vehicle, or for various other uses.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The drive fluid is discharged from the cylinders of the pneumatic drive motor <b>1022</b> via one or more exhaust or return air lines <b>1050</b> and collected in an exhaust pressure return manifold <b>1052</b>. The discharged drive fluid has a reduced pressure (designated the &#x201c;exhaust&#x201d; or &#x201c;low&#x201d; pressure) relative to the higher supply pressure, due to energy extracted to drive the pistons of the drive motor. The exhausted drive fluid is delivered from the exhaust manifold <b>1052</b> to a compressor <b>1060</b>. A secondary drive shaft or power take off shaft <b>62</b> coupled to the output-power drive shaft of the motor <b>1022</b> drives the compressor <b>1060</b>, optionally via a crank pulley <b>64</b> and compressor pulley <b>1066</b> drive mechanism, with the diameter ratio of the crank and compressor pulleys selected to deliver the necessary power to the compressor necessary to raise the pressure of the air or other drive fluid from the lower exhaust pressure back to the higher supply pressure. An oil and air separator <b>1068</b> optionally is provided to remove any oil suspended in the pressurized drive fluid delivered from the compressor. The pressurized drive fluid is then recirculated back to the supply side of the motor system and into the supply manifold <b>18</b> via a primary circulation line <b>1070</b>, or alternatively is directed back to the pressure boost tank <b>1012</b> via a secondary or bypass circulation line <b>1072</b>. Optionally, a three-way valve <b>1074</b> is provided to control the circulation of the pressurized drive fluid to the primary circulation line <b>1070</b> or the bypass circulation line <b>1072</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A clutch <b>1080</b> is optionally controlled by the controller <b>1026</b> via a switch <b>1082</b> to operate the compressor on demand, as needed to pressurize the drive fluid. Optionally, a secondary drive source such as an electrical drive motor (unshown) may drive the compressor in addition to the secondary drive shaft <b>1062</b> to provide make-up pressurization, and/or allow the pressure boost tank <b>1012</b> to be switched off by closing a control valve and taken out of the fluid cycle. Electrical power to drive the electrical drive motor may be delivered from one or more batteries, the power grid, solar panels, wind turbine power generation and/or other source(s).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Because the drive fluid is recirculated through a closed loop&#x2014;from the supply side, through the motor, to the exhaust side, repressurized, and returned to the supply side&#x2014;rather than discharging the exhaust to the atmosphere, the system of the present invention is highly efficient, both in terms of its fuel usage and its emissions. If renewable energy sources are used to pressurize the drive fluid, the system of the present invention may be operated without the need for hydrocarbon-based fuels and have very low or even no emissions. Depending upon factors including: the efficiencies of the various components; the amount of energy drawn from the motor system to drive the generator, vehicle or other application to which the system is applied; the relative pressures of the supply and exhaust sides of the system; the capacity of the pressure boost tank; the flow rate of the drive fluid; the electrical power source, and/or the length of time the motor is to be operated, the system may be self-sustaining or require only periodic recharging.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Various components and subassemblies are suitable for use in the motor system <b>1010</b> of the present invention. In example forms, the pressurized air supply vessel <b>1012</b> is capable of containing drive fluid of up to and about 3500 psi pressurized air and is tapped with a &#xbd;&#x2033; ID (inside diameter) pressure port and a &#xbd;&#x2033; ID return air port, and one or more pressure relief or &#x201c;pop off&#x201d; valves set to release or pop off at factory settings of between 200 psi and 350 psi in example forms. The air injector solenoids <b>1024</b> are coupled to the air rail manifold <b>1018</b> and fitted in a parallel configuration to feed drive fluid through supply lines to each spark plug port <b>1025</b> of the drive motor <b>1022</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The solenoids <b>1024</b> are optionally 3-way solenoids that route supply fluid to the motor in a first stage, and then are switched to shut off the supply flow and allow exhaust fluid to discharge out of the same port <b>1025</b> of the drive motor to the exhaust manifold <b>1052</b> via the return air lines <b>1050</b> in a second stage. Alternatively, output or return air lines connect between separate exhaust ports of the motor cylinders to the return manifold. The pipe connections are, for example, &#xbd;&#x2033; ID flexible high-pressure hose, stainless steel tubing, or other form of conduit. Air pressure regulator valves, sensors and/or gauges are optionally provided for controlling and monitoring the pressures at various stages within the system. An air dryer is optionally included to separate moisture formed by the air compression process and can for example be mounted on the return air side of the pressurized air supply vessel.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drive motor <b>1022</b> can comprise a modified standard automotive-type engine having an engine block with cylinders, valves, pistons, a crankshaft and other components in typical fashion, for example taking the form of a six-cylinder engine. The cylinder head assembly may be substantially similar to a standard automotive cylinder head assembly with modified intake and exhaust manifolds mounted thereon. In alternate forms, the engine block, cylinder heads and pistons may be specially fabricated and formed of aluminum, polymers and/or other lightweight materials, since there is no fuel combustion that would require high-temperature resistant materials. The motor system of the present invention can operate on a modified conventional four-stroke sequence, adjusting the timing of the cam shaft, modifying the distributor rotor, and with the addition of the solenoid air switches. Alternatively, the motor system operates on a modified two-stroke sequence. In further forms of operation, the motor initially starts using a two-stroke cycle, and then switches to a four-stroke cycle. Pressurized drive fluid is delivered to each cylinder in a controlled sequence to drive the cylinder's piston down (the power stroke), thus rotating the crank shaft. In the exhaust stroke, as the subsequent cylinder upstroke begins, the air injector electric solenoid switch closes, and exhaust returns through the three-way solenoid allowing pressurized air to be exhausted from each cylinder to the exhaust manifold <b>1052</b> and returned to the intake of the air compressor <b>1060</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electric timing device or controller <b>1026</b> may comprise, for example an automotive-type rotor distributor, modified with a spring mounted on its outer contact to enhance twelve-volt electrical connection with distributor cap conductors as it makes contact. The coil is optionally removed from the distributor circuit, as fuel ignition is not required in the system of the present invention. The timing device actuates the solenoids in a specified sequence to control operation of the motor. Alternatively, a programmed computer or microprocessor-based controller may be utilized. The controller supplies low voltage electric current to open and close the air injector solenoids <b>1024</b> in the proper sequence. As noted above, if an automotive distributor is used, the coil can be removed to maintain low voltage delivery to the distributor, thereby protecting the solenoids in the air injector electric switches, and the distributor's internal rotor can be modified with a metallic spring to enhance the electrical connection to each of the distributor cap's contacts. As the spring on the distributor's rotor makes contact over the distributor's conductors, electric power can be transferred through electric wires to the respective air switches <b>1024</b> for opening and closing. The timing can be changed from a four-cycle to a two-cycle operation, by way of energizing corresponding cylinder solenoids in the proper sequence on every power stroke. Timing can be accomplished by energizing solenoids <b>1</b> and <b>6</b>, then 2 and 5, then 3 and 4, and so on. A voltage regulator and twelve volt (12V) automotive battery charged by a standard automotive electric alternator can complete the electrical system for the electrical system for the example embodiment. In an alternative method of timing the opening and closing of the air switches <b>1024</b>, an electronic programmable semiconductor timing circuit powered by low voltage is provided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">One or more pressure relief valves within the system prevent over-pressurization, for example, fitted before and after the pressurized air supply vessel <b>1012</b>, in the air pressure supply and air return lines, and/or in the high-pressure drive fluid conduits. One-way check valves are optionally provided in the air pressure lines, the air return lines, and/or in the high-pressure drive fluid conduits, to prevent pressurized air from reversing flow direction and creating back pressure and drag in the system. An air dryer is optionally included in the pneumatic system to reduce moisture produced by the compressed air. An air pressure regulator <b>1014</b> is optionally mounted on or adjacent the air rail <b>1018</b> to set and maintain optimum regulated system pressure. The compressor <b>1060</b> may, for example, take the form of an external belt-driven air compressor driven by the crankshaft of the motor to replenish sufficient air pressure to working fluid driving the motor <b>1022</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A variable manual pressure regulator can optionally be substituted for the pressure regulator described above. Fitted with a floor pedal, the variable manual pressure regulator can function as a &#x201c;throttle&#x201d; in an automotive application to increase or decrease motor revolutions by increasing or decreasing the air pressure to the cylinders. A range of automotive engines can be modified according to the present invention to achieve different power outputs including for example two (2), four (4), six (6), eight (8), ten (10) and twelve (12) cylinder engine configurations. The cylinder count and displacement can be directly proportional to power output of the pneumatic drive motor system providing a range of applications from automotive transportation to constant speed pump or electric generator drives. Diesel engines may be modified according to the invention to provide increased power output due to their larger cylinder displacement. Each manifold of the engine can be modified as described below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Standard automotive engine components can be prepared and modified for conversion to the pneumatic drive motor by providing a retrofit kit for carrying out the modifications according to the present invention. The kit can include a distributor modified by mounting an enlarged conductive metallic spring to the rotor end to provide longer contact with conductors on distributor cap, or the components to modify an automotive distributor in like manner. The standard automotive intake and exhaust manifold can be removed and replaced with the high-pressure manifold <b>1018</b> and exhaust pressure manifold <b>1052</b>, as described, which are also optionally included in the retrofit kit. The air solenoid injectors <b>1024</b> are optionally included in the kit, along with tubing and/or other conduit and connectors for piping the solenoids into communication with the respective spark plug ports of the engine block. The exhaust sides of the solenoids are connected via return pressure air lines to the exhaust pressure manifold <b>1052</b>, also optionally included in the kit. A pressurized air supply vessel <b>1012</b> is optionally included, along with piping and connectors for the drive fluid circuit.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">An assembly method for modifying an engine according to the present invention includes connection of the high-pressure manifold or air rail <b>1018</b> via the pressure air lines <b>1020</b> to the air injector electric solenoids <b>1024</b>, and connection of the air injector solenoids to the spark plug ports of the engine block. The electrical connections from the modified distributor or controller <b>1026</b> are connected to the air solenoid injectors <b>1024</b>. The crankshaft timing is set to just past &#x201c;top dead center&#x201d;. The alternator and external belt driven air compressor <b>1060</b> are installed to engine block <b>1022</b>, and the drive belts are installed and adjusted. The air pressure lines, emergency pressure valve(s), and one-way check valve(s) from the air rail manual pressure regulator are connected to the outlet/pressure side of the pressurized air supply vessel <b>1012</b>. Likewise, the air return lines <b>1050</b> from the three-way solenoids <b>1024</b> are connected to the return air rail or exhaust pressure manifold <b>1052</b>, and the output of the manifold is routed to the intake of the external belt driven air compressor <b>1060</b>. A one-way check valve, emergency pressure relief valve(s) and an air dryer are optionally added to the return air line. The battery <b>1046</b>, starter solenoid <b>1042</b>, start switch <b>1044</b>, and engine starter motor circuit <b>40</b> are connected.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To start the engine, the pressurized air supply vessel <b>1012</b> is charged to about 200 PSI. An external compressor can be used for this purpose. The manual pressure regulator <b>1014</b> is adjusted to about 150 PSI. The starter is engaged, the pressurized drive fluid is released from the supply tank <b>1012</b>, the timing device actuates the solenoids to deliver fluid to the cylinders in the proper sequence, the pistons begin turning the motor, the compressor clutch is engaged, and the drive fluid is circulated to continue the motor's operation. Operating pressure is maintained by the compressor and/or by periodic release from the pressure tank <b>1012</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show another embodiment of a power unit or pneumatic drive motor system <b>1100</b> according to another example form of the invention. An engine <b>1110</b>, such as a FORD inline-6 240CC engine, having an engine block with six pistons <b>1112</b> reciprocating in its cylinders, coupled to a crankshaft by connecting rods, drives a driveshaft <b>1114</b> to drive a power generator G or other equipment such as for example the drive train of an automobile or other vehicle, a pump, etc., in typical fashion. In example form, a 60 kW ONAN electrical generator is connected to the engine output to generate electrical power such as 110V/60 Hz A/C power. High-pressure compressed air, inert gas, water, hydraulic fluid or other liquid or gaseous drive fluid is delivered via inlet line fluid conduits <b>1116</b> to drive the pistons in a two-stroke and/or four-stroke cycle. The drive fluid is delivered to the engine cylinders through the spark plug port of each cylinder, with the intake and exhaust valves seated and disabled. In alternate forms, a customized cylinder head plate is provided, having a ported head plate with inlet ports oriented to direct the drive fluid downward onto the pistons, parallel with the axis of the cylinder and the direction of reciprocal motion of the piston. In alternate embodiments of the invention, because the high temperatures of combustion gasses are not present, the engine <b>1110</b> may include engine block, piston and/or other components comprising polyethylene or other polymeric materials, lightweight aluminum, composite or other low operating temperature materials, thereby reducing weight and manufacturing expense, as compared to iron or steel engine components.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The working fluid is pressurized by a compressor <b>1120</b>, delivered to a high-pressure inlet manifold <b>1130</b>, and distributed from the manifold to the engine inlets <b>1116</b> under the control of electronically switched solenoid valves <b>1140</b>, such as for example 12V plunger solenoids. In example form, the compressor <b>1120</b> may comprise a 45-horsepower high-volume hydraulic rotary screw air compressor, such as a VMAC VR140 vehicle mounted air compressor. An oil/water separator and hydraulic oil reservoir <b>1122</b> and an oil cooler <b>1124</b> are optionally provided in the working fluid conduit <b>1126</b> between the discharge of the compressor and the inlet manifold <b>1130</b>. The oil/water separator and hydraulic oil reservoir <b>1122</b> optionally includes a pop-off or pressure relieve valve <b>1128</b> set to release at about 200 psi. A purge valve <b>1132</b> and a control valve <b>1134</b> are optionally provided in the fluid conduit <b>1126</b> for pressurization and control of the delivery of working fluid to the inlet manifold <b>1130</b>. Optionally, a pressure boost tank (unshown) may be connected to the working fluid conduit to deliver pressurized working fluid to supplement or replace the compressor as a source of high-pressure inlet working fluid.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Operation of the compressor <b>1120</b>, the purge valve <b>1132</b>, the control valve <b>1134</b>, and/or the solenoid valves <b>1140</b>, as well as other components described below, can be controlled by an onboard or remote electronic control system. The control system comprises a programmed computer <b>1150</b> or microprocessor with software installed thereon, connector wiring (shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and control sensors and actuators on the respective system components. For example, the distributor of the engine <b>1110</b> is optionally linked to the computer <b>1150</b> as a position sensor to indicate the stroke position of the pistons for timing the delivery and discharge of the working fluid. The computer <b>1150</b> preferably comprises an input device such as a keyboard or touchscreen and an output device such as a display and/or indicator lights for controlling and displaying the operating parameters of the system.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The compressor <b>1120</b> is alternatively driven by an electric drive motor <b>1160</b> and/or the crankshaft pulley <b>1170</b> of the engine <b>110</b>, via first and second pulley and drive belt systems <b>1162</b>, <b>1172</b>, respectively. In example form, the electric drive motor <b>1160</b> comprises a 25 horsepower, 48V DC, CROWN model no. W7AA01 8.4/10.5 kW electric motor. The ratio of pulley diameters in the first and second pulley and drive belt systems <b>1162</b>, <b>1172</b>, are selected to deliver a specified operating power to the compressor. For example, a 2:1 ratio may be provided by a 7&#x2033; pulley on the motor <b>1160</b> coupled by belt to a 3&#xbd;&#x2033; pulley on the driveshaft of the compressor <b>1120</b>; and a 13&#x2033; crankshaft pulley may be coupled by belt to a 7&#x2033; pulley on the compressor shaft. An electronically switched clutch <b>1165</b> may be provided to control application of power to the driveshaft of the compressor <b>1120</b> from the motor <b>160</b> and/or the crankshaft pulley <b>1170</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reduced-pressure working fluid exhausted from the engine cylinders on the upstroke or return stroke of the pistons is ported via the solenoid valves <b>1140</b> to a return conduit <b>1180</b> and delivered back to the inlet of the compressor <b>1120</b> as a ram-air intake delivery. Because the exhaust fluid is typically at a higher pressure than the atmosphere, less power is required from the compressor to bring the working fluid back up to the working inlet pressure than ambient intake air, and the suction of the compressor inlet may assist in pulling the exhaust fluid from the return conduit and cylinders to provide improved efficiency. In alternate forms, the exhaust fluid is discharged to the atmosphere, and the compressor inlet draws in entirely fresh filtered intake air from the ambient surroundings.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The electric drive motor <b>1160</b> is powered by one or more batteries <b>1190</b>, and/or other power source(s). In the depicted embodiment, four 12V deep-cycle marine type batteries are connected in parallel to provide a 48V output to drive the motor <b>160</b>. An alternator or generator <b>1200</b> is optionally coupled by a belt and pulley drive <b>1202</b> to a crankshaft pulley of the engine, and electrically connected to charge the batteries <b>1190</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, a solar panel <b>1210</b> is provided to collect solar energy from the sun S or other light source and convert it to electrical power to charge the batteries <b>1190</b>. In alternate embodiments, a wind-power turbine or other renewable, natural and/or free energy source(s) is/are utilized in place of or in addition to the solar panel to charge the batteries <b>1190</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In operation, the compressor <b>1120</b> is initially started under power of the electric drive motor <b>1160</b>, which is in turn powered by the batteries <b>1190</b> and/or the solar panel <b>1210</b>. In example forms of operation, the compressor is purged at about 2200 revolutions per minute (rpm) for about 15 seconds to develop a working pressure of about 180-200 pounds per square inch (psi) in the air or other working fluid, and then reduced to about 800-1100 rpm to maintain a working delivery pressure of about 180-200 psi at a delivery rate of about 150-250 cubic feet per minute (cfm). The computer <b>1150</b> controls actuation of the purge valve <b>1132</b> and the control valve <b>1134</b> based on pressure sensed in the working fluid conduit <b>1126</b> as the compressor is purged and transitioned to normal operating speed. An electric starter motor starts the engine <b>1110</b> turning.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Once working pressure has been reached, the computer <b>1150</b> controls operation of the solenoid valves to deliver pressurized working fluid to and from the inlet ports of the cylinders of engine <b>1110</b> to drive the engine's pistons in a predetermined two-stroke or four-stroke sequence, and optionally switches the operating cycle between two-stroke and four-stroke operation depending on the desired operating rpm speed and/or power output. The sequence of actuation and timing of pistons <b>1</b> through <b>6</b> in two-stroke operation is: cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>6</b> at 0&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>5</b> at 60&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinders <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> at 120&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>6</b> at 180&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinders <b>2</b> and <b>5</b> at 240&#xb0; past top-dead-center, and cylinders <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> at 300&#xb0; past top-dead-center, two cylinders firing at a time. The sequence of actuation and timing of pistons <b>1</b> through <b>6</b> in four-stroke operation is: cylinder <b>1</b> at 5&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinder <b>5</b> at 60&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinder <b>3</b> at 120&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinder <b>6</b> at 180&#xb0; past top-dead-center, cylinder <b>2</b> at 240&#xb0; past top-dead-center, and cylinder <b>4</b> at 300&#xb0; past top-dead-center, one cylinder firing at a time. A sensor head is connected to the rotor rod of the engine's distributor (which turns with the camshaft of the engine). A positional sensor in the sensor head sends a signal to the computer controller <b>1150</b> indicating the timing position (corresponding to the degrees of rotation past top-dead-center), allowing the computer to control opening and closing of the solenoid valves <b>1140</b> in the desired sequence and timing. The timing is optionally initiated slightly past top-dead-center so that the cylinders are pressurized just after the piston starts its downstroke, to avoid generating backpressure at the end of the piston's upstroke. The solenoid valves are opened to allow free exhaust of the driving fluid on the piston upstroke, also to avoid developing back-pressure in the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The pistons turn the engine to drive the crankshaft and in turn the driveshaft output of the engine to drive the generator, drive train or other powered equipment. In example forms of operation, the engine turns at between about 900-2200 rpm, with the speed being controlled by the computer <b>1150</b> based on user input, via operation of the control valve <b>1134</b> and control of the solenoids <b>1140</b>. The speed of the engine (rpm) can be varied by operation of the control valve <b>1134</b> to adjust the airflow (cfm) to the supply rail <b>1130</b>. The horsepower or torque delivered by the engine can be varied by control of the duration of time during which the solenoid valves <b>1140</b> are opened to pressurize the cylinders from the supply rail, which adjusts the pressure applied to the pistons.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Upon reaching a predefined operating speed, the clutch <b>1165</b> is operated under control of the computer <b>1150</b> to engage the compressor drive from the crankshaft pulley <b>1170</b>, which in turn is driven by the engine <b>1110</b>, and to disengage the compressor drive from the electric drive motor <b>1160</b>. The electric drive motor <b>160</b> is then de-energized so as not to draw power from the batteries. Optionally, the electric drive motor may continue to be driven by the crankshaft pulley <b>1170</b> through the clutch, and act as a reverse-motor generator to recharge the batteries <b>1190</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, the alternator <b>1200</b>, the generator G, and/or the solar panel operate to recharge the batteries <b>1190</b> under the control of computer <b>1150</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the pressure of the working fluid delivered by the compressor drops below a predefined threshold minimum working pressure, the computer <b>1150</b> re-engages the electric drive motor <b>1160</b> and switches the clutch <b>1165</b> to drive the compressor from the electric drive motor in order to bring the working pressure back up. Upon reaching a predefined maximum working pressure, the clutch disengages the electric drive motor <b>160</b>, and the electric drive motor is deactivated. The engine continues to operate in this manner, with the compressor <b>1120</b> driven by the engine <b>1110</b> and periodically supplemented as needed by the electric drive motor <b>1160</b> to maintain desired operation. Because the electric drive motor <b>1160</b> only draws power from the batteries <b>1190</b> periodically, the battery charge may be very long lasting. Recharging of the batteries as described, optionally supplemented by solar or other renewable energy, results in a highly efficient, low emission, and long-lasting source of power.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show an example embodiment of a power module <b>100</b> according to an example form of the present invention.

In example embodiments, the power unit comprises a modified cylinder head with no valves, lifters, or separate intake and exhaust ports. Rather, each pair of intake and exhaust ports is combined into a single port located directly above and axially aligned to the center of each piston (i.e., four combined injection/exhaust ports <b>16</b> for a four-cylinder motor). The placement of the combined injection/exhaust ports in this manner increases the force applied to the pistons and the overall performance. In alternate forms, the power unit <b>21</b> does not comprise a modified head and the compressed driving fluid is injected into the power unit through the igniter or spark plug entry. Additionally, single-cylinder, two-cylinder, six-cylinder, eight-cylinder, ten-cylinder, twelve-cylinder, and other arrangements are within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">An integrated fluid storage tank <b>40</b> and/or manifold <b>10</b> built into the charging system enclosure or frame <b>44</b> of the power module <b>21</b>. Under normal operation, the system manifold <b>10</b> is configured to store a volume of compressed drive fluid. In the depicted embodiment, the compressed drive fluid is delivered from the high-pressure system manifold <b>10</b> to the power unit <b>21</b> via compressed fluid supply lines <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>in a delivery sequence controlled by four independent solenoids (i.e., supply system solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>)&#x2014;one solenoid per cylinder.

In example embodiments and modes of operation, compressed air or other inert gas drive fluid from the tank <b>10</b> may be used for system startup upon initial activation and/or pressure addition to make up for pressure loss during operation, while the system's compressor provides most of the pressurized drive fluid during normal operation after the initial start-up</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The firing (i.e., piston reciprocation) sequence and timing of the supply system solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be driven by a slipring timing shaft assembly <b>300</b>. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;firing&#x201d; refers generally to the act of activation or actuation, for example by time actuation of one or more solenoid valves to deliver pressurized air or other inert fluid to a cylinder of the modified engine to drive the piston, rather than to the combustion of fuel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-C</figref>, the slipring assembly comprises a plurality of sliprings&#x2014;including one positive-lead slipring <b>310</b> (slipring #1) and four negative-lead sliprings <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>350</b> (slipring #2, slipring #3, slipring #4, and slipring #5, respectively)&#x2014;and a plurality of slipring spacers <b>360</b> connected to a central timing shaft <b>302</b>. In the depicted embodiment, a slipring spacer <b>360</b> is positioned between each slipring. The central shaft <b>302</b> is mounted to a slipring assembly housing or enclosure via bearings provided at each end of the central shaft. The central shaft is further connected to a crank shaft of the power unit <b>21</b> (i.e., by two matching, or similarly sized, timing geared pulleys&#x2014;one on the crankshaft and one on the slipring assembly shaft <b>302</b>&#x2014;via a common toothed belt matching the teeth on the geared pulleys) such that the rotation of the slipring assembly matches the rotation of the power unit <b>21</b>. The sliprings are also connected via a central electrically conductive wire <b>305</b> extending through each of the sliprings to provide 12 VDC connectivity from slipring <b>304</b><i>a </i>to sliprings <b>304</b><i>b</i>-<i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In example embodiments, each slipring comprises an arcuate electrically conductive or contact strip (preferably, of copper or other conductive material) provided along at least a portion of its body periphery. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the positive lead slipring <b>310</b> comprises a contact strip <b>314</b> which extends entirely around the periphery of its slipring body <b>311</b>. On the other hand, negative lead sliprings <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b>, and <b>350</b> comprise contact strips <b>324</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>344</b>, and <b>354</b> (respectively) which extend along a portion of the periphery of the slipring bodies <b>321</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>341</b>, and <b>351</b> (respectively). Each of the contact strips are further connected in electrically conductive contact to the central carrier wire by flat wires or conductive paths <b>316</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>346</b>, and <b>356</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As noted above, firing of the supply system solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>is directly correlated to the configuration of the slipring assembly <b>300</b>. Specifically, the position and configuration of contact strip of each negative lead slipring dictates the firing sequence and timing of the supply system solenoid valves. In the depicted embodiment, the position of the contact strip on each subsequent negative lead slipring is phased 90 degrees, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> shows the positions of the contact strips on the sliprings relative to one another). In the depicted embodiment, the firing order of the cylinders in the power unit <b>21</b> is &#x201c;cylinders #1-3-4-2.&#x201d; Accordingly, cylinders #1, 3, 4, and 2 in the power unit <b>21</b> are paired to sliprings #2, 3, 4, 5, respectively.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Additionally, the stroke of each piston in the power unit is determined by the length of the contact strips. In example embodiments, the length of the contact strip is established to match the stroke of the power unit plus an advance connection to provide compressed drive fluid slightly after the cylinder reaches the top dead center firing position. In the depicted embodiment, for example, the contact strips <b>324</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>344</b>, and <b>354</b> are approximately 18-22 mm in length including a 7 mm advancement; however, the length of the contact strip may vary depending on each power unit's cylinder stroke.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, each slipring (<b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b>, and <b>350</b>) is paired to a spring-loaded brush assembly (<b>304</b><i>a</i>, <b>304</b><i>b</i>, <b>304</b><i>c</i>, <b>304</b><i>d</i>, <b>304</b><i>e</i>, respectively) configured to make contact with the contact strips <b>314</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>344</b>, and <b>354</b>, respectively. In example embodiments, the brush assemblies are mounted to a wall of the slipring assembly housing (not shown) with brush assemblies <b>304</b><i>b</i>, <b>304</b><i>c</i>, <b>304</b><i>d</i>, and <b>304</b><i>e </i>wired to four supply system solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In operation, as the crank shaft drives and turns the slipring assembly <b>300</b>, the contact strip of each negative lead slipring makes intermittent contact with its respective brush assembly at different times (determined by the distribution of the contact strips). Each time a brush assembly makes contact with a corresponding contact strip, the contacted contact strip carries a 12 vdc or other signal voltage back through the associated brush assembly to complete the circuit which in turn fires (i.e., opens) the appropriate solenoid valve, and after the contact strip moves out of contact with the brush assembly, the signal voltage stops and the solenoid closes. Alternatively, the power unit solenoids may be controlled and managed digitally using a crank sensor coupled to the PLC module.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In example embodiments, a computer control system or programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>30</b> controls the operation of the power unit <b>21</b> by controlling the percentage or degree the proportional control valve <b>3</b> is opened or closed. The PLC has an internal clock that runs continuously and measures the total run time and intermittent system run time. Under normal operations, the power unit <b>21</b> starts in a two-stroke mode. In the two-stroke mode, the compressed drive fluid is supplied to one cylinder per one rotation of the crankshaft. If the power unit <b>21</b> falls below 1800 rpm (revolutions per minute), the PLC automatically shifts the system to the modified two-stroke mode wherein the compressed drive fluid is supplied to two cylinders simultaneously in one rotation of the crankshaft. On the other hand, if the power unit runs above 1,800 rpm, the PLC shifts the system to the four-stroke mode wherein the compressed fluid is supplied to one cylinder per two rotations of the crankshaft. If the system is pressurized beyond a set point or parameter, pressure is automatically released via pressure relief valve <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In example embodiments, the power unit or engine <b>21</b> operates with a four-stroke sequence or cycle completing one power cycle per two rotations of the crankshaft and four strokes of the piston, the four-stroke cycle comprising four stages including intake, compression, power, and exhaust. In other example embodiments, the power unit <b>21</b> comprises a two-stroke cycle completing one power cycle per rotation of the crankshaft.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some example embodiments, the power unit <b>21</b> may also operate with a two-stroke or modified two-stroke cycle completing one power per rotation of the crankshaft but firing on two cylinders simultaneously. For example, in the two-stroke mode, the compressed fluid is delivered or injected per the firing sequence of the power unit (i.e., cylinder #1, cylinder #3, cylinder #4, and cylinder #2) with the injection occurring at approximately two degrees after 0 degrees equating to a cylinder firing one time per rotation of the crank. Therefore, in a four-cylinder engine, the firing sequence is cylinder #1, cylinder #3, cylinder #4, and cylinder #2. In other words, for two stroke mode, each cylinder will fire once per rotation; however, while in two-stroke modified mode, cylinders #1 and cylinder #4 fire together and cylinders #3 and cylinder #2 fire together. Accordingly, the modified two-stroke cycle can approximately double the torque of the power unit <b>21</b> compared to a non-modified two-stroke cycle.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In still other example embodiments, the power unit <b>21</b> may operate with a double modified two-stroke cycle completing two power cycles per rotation of the crankshaft. In a double modified two-stroke power unit or engine <b>21</b>, two cylinders are fired at the same time at approximately 2&#xb0; (degrees) past the top dead center and approximately 2&#xb0; (degrees) past the bottom dead center. In the double modified two-stroke mode, the compressed fluid is injected twice per rotation (i.e., cylinders #1 and #4, cylinders #3 and #2, cylinders #4 and #1, and cylinders #2 and #3) with the injection occurring at approximately two degrees after 0 and 180 degrees equating to completion of two power cycles per rotation of the crank. Similar to the modified two-stroke cycle, the firing sequence in the double modified two-stroke cycle is also cylinder #1, cylinder #4, cylinder #3, and cylinder #2, meaning cylinder #1 and cylinder #4 fire together and cylinder #2 and cylinder #3 fire together. However, with the double modified two-stroke cycle, the torque is more than four-times the torque produced by the normal four stroke cycle. As noted above, the modified two-stroke cycle or mode about doubles the torque of the power unit and the double modified two-stroke cycle about quadruples the torque of the power unit when compared to a normal four-stroke cycle</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Compression of the operating or drive fluid is provided or accomplished with one or more compressors. In the depicted example embodiment, independent 12 VDC compressors <b>1</b> and <b>37</b>. In example embodiments, compressors <b>1</b> and <b>37</b> provide a minimum of 40 L/min (volumetric flow) and approximately 30 psi (pounds per square inch) in pressure to the overall power module system. In some example embodiments, at least one of the compressors <b>1</b> and <b>37</b> may be a vertical conical compressor, such as for example Vert Rotors&#x2122; Vert Conical Rotary Compressor. The compressed fluid is stored in the fluid storage tank <b>40</b> and/or manifold <b>10</b> which are built into the frame of the system and configured to store a volume of compressed fluid. In example embodiments, the primary compressor <b>1</b> is adapted to provide enough compressed fluid for normal operations. However, if additional compressed fluid is required (for example, when the power module shifts into a modified two-stroke mode), secondary compressor <b>37</b> is engaged to supplement the system with additional compressed fluid. Alternatively, additional pressured fluid may be provided from the tank <b>10</b> upon demand. Once the demand or load is reduced and the system returns to normal operation, the secondary compressor <b>37</b> disengages and the system relies on the primary compressor <b>1</b> alone once again.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the power module <b>100</b> also comprises a recirculation line between the power unit <b>21</b> and the fluid storage tank <b>40</b> via a venturi <b>4</b>. In example embodiments, the recirculation line directs the exhaust from the power unit <b>21</b>, which can be classified as an uncompressed or lower-pressure fluid (i.e., uncompressed air or other inert fluid), to the suction side of the venturi. In example embodiments, the venturi is provided between the compressors <b>1</b> and <b>37</b> and the fluid storage tank <b>40</b>. The compressed fluid creates a slight negative pressure on the recirculation line as the high-pressure fluid from the compressor(s) flows across the venturi, which in turn applies a negative pressure on the exhaust side of the power unit <b>21</b>. This helps evacuate each cylinder in the power unit <b>21</b> by removing any back pressure from the system. Accordingly, the recirculation line lowers the overall friction and drag on the power module <b>100</b>, which in turn corresponds to lower internal energy consumption and higher overall efficiency. While this is advantageous in both open and closed loop operations, the advantage is greater in closed-loop operations because removal of such resistance in closed loop operations helps conserve the inert fluid used in the system. In some example embodiments, lower-pressure exhaust fluid from the motor of the power unit is delivered to the compressor inlet, and operation of the compressor raises the pressure of the working fluid back up to the higher operating or fluid-drive pressure, whereupon the working fluid is then recycled back to the intake ports of the motor and/or to the fluid storage tank.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The electrical power required to run the power module <b>100</b> is stored and supplied by the generator <b>29</b> and/or the battery bank <b>34</b>. In example embodiments, battery bank <b>34</b> comprises three separate batteries (i.e., battery #1, battery #2, and battery #3) working in tandem to ensure at least one battery has enough charge to power the power module. For example, when battery #1 is in use, #2 is in standby and #3 is charging; when battery #2 is in use, #3 is in standby and #1 is charging; and when battery #3 is in use, #1 is in standby and #2 is charging. As each battery reaches about 25% capacity, the battery in standby is switched into service while the battery that was charging goes into standby, and the battery coming out of service begins charging. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the battery bank <b>34</b> is configured to receive a trickle charge from the generator during operation or from a solar panel connected to the system when the power module is not in use, to recharge the battery bank. If the battery bank is empty, the power module <b>100</b> may draw enough power from the powered system (e.g., the EV or HEV) to start the power module. Accordingly, battery power is always available.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In example embodiments, the battery bank is used to provide 12 vdc power to the electrical components of the power module. When the power unit is running it is attached to a generator via a drive shaft. The generator produces a power (for example, 10 kW at 7,000 rpm, 240 V, &#x2dc;42 amps). A portion of this produced power is placed into a recharge circuit to charge the batteries or battery bank. The remaining power (for example, 240 V, &#x2dc;32 amps) is converted to VDC and output to the powered electrically powered system (e.g., the EV or HEV), or an onboard battery management system to charge the powered system's batteries during operation or use.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In example embodiments, the power module <b>100</b> further comprises a gearing assembly, including a gear box, mounted between the power unit <b>21</b> and the generator <b>29</b>. Generally, an input shaft of the gear box is attached to a flywheel of the power unit <b>21</b> and an output shaft of the gear box is attached to the rotor of the generator <b>29</b>. Gearing is such that a ratio of 4 to 1 is created allowing the power unit to operate at a lower RPM (approximately 2,500-3,000 rpm) and the output shaft to the generator has a resulting rotation at about 10,000-12,000 rpm. Variable output rpm allows for an increase in output electrical capacity from the generator with no additional work from the power unit. However, the power unit would have a corresponding reduction in torque. For example, replacing a 10 kW generator with a 20 kW generator will not affect any change to the power unit or any other component. In example embodiments, lower power unit rpm corresponds to less operating wear on the power unit and a longer unit/system life. In some example embodiments, the generator is PCB (printed circuit board) stator type generator (alternative to copper winding type generators).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to example modes of use, the power module <b>100</b> is activated with a press of a start button <b>48</b>. In example embodiments, the start button <b>48</b> is provided on a display screen <b>47</b> provided for example on the top or front panel of the power module <b>100</b> for easy and convenient user access. In other example embodiments, the start button may additionally or alternatively be provided on a remote control and/or a wireless device to activate the power module remotely. In still other example embodiments, the power module <b>200</b> may be started remotely from another device via a wireless connection such as for example Bluetooth, Wi-fi, cellular, radio, or the like. For example, the power module could be started from a dedicated mobile application installed on a mobile smartphone or a dedicated remote control.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Pressing the start button <b>48</b>, or otherwise activating the power module, engages the PLC which initiates a startup sequence including an initial check of the system components such as for example sensors A-G. The results of the system check are displayed on displays <b>47</b> and, if paired or connected, on other paired remote devices. If no issues or errors are identified during the initial system check, the starter motor <b>22</b> is energized allowing the power unit <b>21</b> to cycle for an initial cycle period (for example about five seconds) and lubricate all internal parts via the belt <b>23</b> connected flywheel <b>24</b>. After the initial cycle period, the starter motor <b>22</b> positions the flywheel <b>24</b> so that Sensor C indicates and displays a reading indicating power unit cylinder #1 is at two degrees past top dead center. Once this indication is recognized by the PLC, energy is removed from the starter motor <b>22</b> and the main power unit cycle or operations begins.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As noted above, the power module <b>100</b> is operable in two main operating modes: a closed-loop or -system mode and an open-loop or -system mode. In the open system mode, the power module <b>100</b> compresses air from its environment to drive the power unit <b>21</b>. In the closed system mode, no outside air is introduced into the system. Rather, the compressible fluid utilized to drive the power unit <b>21</b> is stored in an internal, pressurized fluid storage tank <b>40</b>. Accordingly, in the closed system mode, the power module <b>100</b> is still operable in environments with low or no air (such as for example underwater and in space).

In the depicted embodiment, the timing module is the slipring assembly <b>300</b>. In other example embodiments, the timing module may be a software-controlled PLC module using a crank position sensor that transmits the crank position back to the PLC module which then controls the firing of the supply system solenoids <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>accordingly. The compressed fluid then begins flowing from the primary compressor <b>1</b> to the manifold (not shown) where the manifold is pressurized. As solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>open, the compressed fluid flows through lines <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>&#x2014;d, then through lines <b>14</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and into power unit cylinders <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, per the timing module for the power unit. The resulting pressure applied to each cylinder <b>15</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, and the corresponding piston heads, forces the piston down creating a rotational energy turning the attached shaft mounted generator <b>29</b> and providing a prescribed output power based on the generator design specifications and the rotational speed of the crankshaft.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0094">In example modes of use, the compressed fluid is exhausted via exhaust lines <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>through solenoid valves <b>13</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and into supply system solenoid valve exhaust lines <b>17</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, and finally through the main exhaust line <b>18</b>. The exhausted fluid continues through the main exhaust isolation solenoid valve <b>19</b> and exhaust line check valve <b>20</b> into the exhaust injection venturi <b>4</b>. As noted above, the use of the venturi creates a slight negative pressure on each cylinder exhaust acting to remove any back pressure on the system that would adversely place drag on the system and effectively increase overall system operating efficiency. Some or all of the lower-pressure exhaust fluid is returned to the compressor inlet, and the compressor repressurizes the working fluid to the higher-pressure working fluid operating pressure and discharges the working fluid to be recycled back to fluid supply line to the motor intake. The compressor <b>1</b>, <b>37</b> is electrically driven by an electric motor powered by the battery bank <b>34</b> and/or the generator <b>29</b>.

By recycling the working fluid through the closed-loop system and onboard recharging, example embodiments of the present invention enable a self-contained and highly efficient system for electrical power generation capable of long-duration sustained power delivery.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0095">If the PLC senses a decrease in the system speed (in revolutions per min, rpm) at sensor C below a predetermined setpoint (indicating an increased load on the generator), then the proportional control valve <b>3</b> is opened further. As a result, more compressed fluid enters the system, and the overall pressure increases in the system. In turn, more compressed fluid is injected into the power unit which raises the system speed of the power unit and more electrical energy is produced. Conversely, if the PLC senses an increase in the system speed at Sensor C (indicating a decrease in load on the generator), then steps (1)-(5) above are reversed and the opposite effect occurs.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0096">In the open-loop mode, if the primary compressor <b>1</b> is unable to maintain the necessary fluid flow or the prescribed system pressure, charging system isolation solenoid valve <b>43</b> and intake isolation solenoid valve <b>56</b> are opened to charge second, auxiliary compressor <b>37</b>, and additional compressed fluid (i.e., atmospheric air) is applied to the system to support the system operations. Once the increased system volume is no longer required, and demand has decreased, the secondary compressor <b>37</b> is de-energized and valves <b>43</b> and <b>56</b> are closed. In example embodiments, the volume requirement of the system is directly related to the power unit operation mode&#x2014;i.e., a four stroke, two stroke or two stroke modified mode. In the two-stroke mode, each solenoid fires with every rotation&#x2014;compared to every 2<sup>nd </sup>rotation in a four-stroke mode&#x2014;thus the volume requirement is doubled. In the two-stroke modified mode, two solenoids (two cylinders) fire with every rotation thus the volume requirement is quadrupled and equally increases the resulting torque.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0097">On the other hand, in a closed-loop system, if the primary compressor <b>1</b> is unable to maintain the necessary fluid flow or the prescribed system pressure, charging system isolation valve <b>43</b> and fluid recharge isolation value <b>55</b> (in lieu of intake isolation valve <b>56</b>) are opened to charge the second, auxiliary compressor <b>37</b>, and additional compressed fluid (i.e., compressible fluid from fluid storage tank <b>40</b>) is applied to the system to support system operations.

In alternate embodiments, the default mode of operation is the closed-loop mode, and the user may switch to open-loop mode operation. The main operation (in either open- or closed-loop mode) will continue as normal until either (1) the power module is turned off or shut off via stop button <b>49</b>; (2) the powered article's (e.g., the EV or HEV) battery bank is at 90% capacity and charging is no longer required; or (3) the power module is removed the rack.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0108">In example embodiments, the motor or power unit <b>21</b> is driven by air or other inert pressurized fluid as described above and drives the generator <b>29</b> to produce electrical power. The generated electrical power may be utilized to directly power for example an electric or hybrid vehicle; to charge the battery of an electric or hybrid vehicle; to power a home or commercial electric system; as a standalone generator; to power other electrically powered systems, articles, or objects; for sale to utility companies via the power grid; or for various other purposes. A portion of the electrical power generated may be also directed to recharge the batteries <b>34</b>. Optionally, two or more power modules <b>100</b> may be utilized in combination with one another in applications with higher power requirements or for longer duration of extended use.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an application of the power module <b>100</b> with electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. In the depict embodiment, power module <b>100</b> is a portable, interchangeable power system for charging electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and other manned and unmanned electric vehicles including, but not limited to, drones, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), aircrafts, and other similar electric vehicles and/or devices. Preferably, the power module is sized to be portable and easily handled by its users. For example, in example embodiments, the power module is preferably about two cubic feet. However, the power module can be sized as needed or desired to meet the demands of each application (or, alternatively, multiple power modules can be used together to meet the demands of each application). In example embodiments, different types of vehicles (e.g., different manufacturers, different models, etc.) or other powered objects or systems may be configured with a universal receiver and power connections configured for compatibility with the power module <b>100</b>, whereby the power module is configured for universal use in multiple applications.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0110">The power module <b>100</b> optionally includes a rectifier, whereby the module is capable of operating in both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) modes. When paired to an EV or HEV for example, the power module can be configured to produce usable DC voltage and amperage. For example, a 240 VAC (volts of alternating current) output from the system generator may be rectified to produce for example approximately 288 to 336 VDC (volts of direct current) where it is then utilized for use in charging the EV or HEV battery bank.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0111">Alternatively, or additionally, the power module <b>100</b> can be used as a stand-alone power source (i.e., in the same manner as a conventional generator or alternator) to supply power to other electronic devices and/or systems. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the power module <b>100</b> secured to a receiving or docking station <b>250</b> installed in a residential structure or building R. In this form, the power module <b>100</b> is configured to supply electrical energy to power the building or a portion thereof. In such use, the 240 VAC output is rectified and inverted to produce a usable voltage. While in AC mode, software in the power module may also activate one or more AC outlets on the power module with each outlet wired through for example a minimum 20-amp breaker located and operated from the front panel. The AC outlets can be used to charge or power other electronic devices, such as for example, phones, laptops, appliances, electronic equipment, etc. In some example embodiments, using the power module <b>100</b> to provide power to for example a residential building may require connection from the power module to a transfer switch provided or installed on the building's electrical circuit.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0112">According to example embodiments of the present invention, multiple power modules <b>100</b> may be connected or used together to increase the usable output power to meet the demand of each application as needed. Depending on the application, the power module, or set of power modules, may be configured to function as the sole, primary power system or as a back-up, secondary power system to other existing power systems.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0113">In example embodiments, each electrically powered system or article (e.g., vehicle, device, or structure) configured for use with power modules <b>100</b> is preferably configured or fitted with a racking system or operating rack <b>400</b>. The racking system <b>400</b> is preferably mounted or affixed to the powered system and comprises a housing or receptacle <b>402</b> for receiving a power module <b>100</b> therein. Preferably, the operating rack <b>400</b> is sized to accommodate the power module required or dedicated for each application. For example, the power module for a tractor trailer rig may be larger than a power module for an electric pontoon boat. Accordingly, the racking system on the tractor trailer rig will be larger than the racking system on the electric pontoon boat which requires a smaller power module. Alternatively, the racking systems may comprise more than one receptacle to accommodate multiple power modules to meet the demands of different applications. For example, the racking system mounted to a tractor trailer rig may comprise three receptacles for receiving three universally sized power modules whereas the racking system mounted to an electric pontoon boat comprises only one receptacle for one power module. Herein, modular charging and power system (MCPS) refers to a system comprising an operating rack and the respective power module(s); however, each power module can be used independently for all intents and purposes as long as a means to connect the power module to the system or device needing power is provided&#x2014;for example, a power cable or other suitable electrical connectors plugged or connected to the power module's power output plug adapter <b>36</b><i>a </i>or <b>36</b><i>b </i>or outlets <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0114">In example embodiments, the racking system comprises one or more receptacles configured and sized to receive therein one or more power modules. Likewise, each power module is configured to slide or otherwise fit into a corresponding receptacle utilizing guide rails attached to the receptacle, the power module, or both. The guide rails ensure that each power module that is inserted into a receptacle is properly aligned to charging ports provided in the receptacles. Installing a power module into a proper receptacle automatically connects the power module to the powered article (such as for example an EV or HEV) via a module plug provided on a rear face or side of the power module. The power modules also include one or more handles on its front face or side for handling and manipulating the power modules in and out of the rack. In example embodiments, the guiding rails comprise one or more predetermined stops affixed thereto which prevent power modules from being pulled out or falling out inadvertently from the receptacle. The guide rails comprise a release trigger or mechanism to release the power module from the guide rails for removal. According to example embodiments of the present invention, removal of any power module from the racking system does not adversely affect the operation of the powered article.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0115">Moreover, each module comprises one or more display features on its exterior. In example embodiments, the power modules also comprise digital displays or interactive user interfaces which display the power module's and/or the MCPS's health and operating parameters. Preferably, the digital displays are provided on the front, exposed face, or surface of each power module for easy access and reading even during use. Optionally, each power module inserted in a racking system requires a multi-digit (for example, a four digit) code to begin operations. If the power module is removed and reinserted into the racking system, the multi-digit code must be reentered for the MCPS to function and operation. In some example embodiments, if more than one power module is secured to the racking system, the entire system can be controlled from one power module&#x2014;preferably the power module in the first position.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0116">In example embodiments, the power module <b>100</b> is configured to operate in either open-loop or closed-loop operational modes. In the open-loop mode, the power module compresses air drawn from its surrounding environment which is then used to drive the power unit and generator to produce electrical energy. In the closed-loop mode, the power module utilizes compressed inert fluids stored in an internal pressurized storage tank in a closed system. As such, the closed-loop mode allows use of the power module in environments and settings where there is limited or no atmospheric air, such as for example in explosive environments, underwater, and in space.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0117">The power module <b>100</b> is also rechargeable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a charging station <b>200</b> according to one example form of the present invention. In the depicted embodiment, the charging station <b>200</b> is configured to support and charge multiple power modules <b>100</b> simultaneously and comprises a plurality of receptacles or slots <b>202</b> for removably receiving power modules <b>100</b> therein. Each receptacle <b>202</b> comprises at least one charging outlet or port adapted for establishing an electrical and/or fluid connection with the power modules <b>100</b> to replenish or recharge the batteries and/or pressurized driving fluids. Each receptacle <b>202</b> further comprises guidance or transfer features such as for example sliding rails or channels to facilitate easy module insertion into and retrieval from the receptacle. Alternatively, the sliding rails also ensure that each power module inserted into a receptacle is properly aligned to the charging ports during installation. Installing a power module into a proper receptacle automatically connects the power module to the powered article or system (such as for example an EV or HEV) via a module plug provided on a rear face or side of the power module. In example embodiments, each receptacle also comprises certain safety features. For example, the sliding rails include safety stop mechanisms which prevent a power module from being pulled out or sliding out beyond a preset distance unless the safety stop mechanism is intentionally disengaged.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0118">Charging stations may also comprise other forms and configurations to handle various capacities and demands. In some example embodiments, the charging station <b>200</b> may alternatively, or additionally, include one or more means, such as for example cables, tubes, lines, etc., for directly plugging into or connecting to the powered system. In other example embodiments, charging station may be configured to charge one power module at a time rather than multiple power modules simultaneously. In still other example embodiments, the station <b>200</b> may alternative, or additionally, be utilized as a vending station for power modules. For example, users may deposit dead or malfunctioning power modules into an empty receptacle <b>200</b> for example in exchange for a replenished or new power module. The station <b>200</b> conducts a system check on the deposited power module, and if the power module is dead or malfunctioning, the power module is locked to the receptacle and a service provider or supplier is alerted to retrieve and replace the dead power module from the station <b>200</b>. In still other example embodiments, a docking station <b>250</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, may be configured to receive a power module <b>100</b>. In some example embodiments, the docking station <b>250</b> may also include a separate charging station in addition to the docking station <b>250</b>. In other example embodiments, the docking station <b>250</b> may be configured with charging capabilities for recharging spent or dead power modules in the same station.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0119">Preferably, the charging stations <b>200</b> are located in high-traffic areas to maximize and ease use thereof. For example, charging stations <b>200</b> can be located near high-traffic intersections, commercial and business centers, parking lots/decks, etc. so that the charging stations are easily and conveniently accessible. In use, users either acquire new power modules or exchange used or spent power modules for fully charged or new ones at the charging stations. In some example embodiments, users may recharge their power module rather than exchanging theirs with another. In example embodiments, the charging stations can be set up or constructed with payment systems to facilitate the sale or rental of power modules. The charging stations may also comprise one or more displays showing the health and/or available charge of each power module docked in the charging station.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0120">The modular charging and power system and/or the power modules can deliver a wide range of DC voltage. Accordingly, the self-charging system and its power modules can be used with lithium-ion batteries, or any other suitable type of batteries being developed now or planned for development in the future, such as for example solid state batteries, lithium silicon batteries, lithium metal batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, lithium air batteries, NanoBolt&#x2122; lithium tungsten batteries, zinc manganese oxide batteries, etc. Additionally, or alternatively, the system may be scaled up or down in size and/or capacity in order to accommodate different power demands or needs of each application.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0121">In example embodiments, the modular charging and power system and/or the power modules can be configured for use with EVs, HEVs, fuel cell vehicles, or other types of vehicles or machines that for example use batteries to drive or power motors for propulsion, including, but not limited to, passenger cars, SUVs, vans, pickup trucks, RVs, buses, taxis, limousines, delivery trucks, garbage trucks, intermodal delivery trucks, trains, race cars, drones, electric airplanes, delivery robots, warehouse robots, boats, barges, yachts, cruise ships, freighters, etc.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0122">In other example embodiments, the MCPS and/or the power modules can be used for example as primary or secondary (i.e., back-up) power systems for homes, farms, businesses, police, military, schools, cell towers, data centers, islands, or to charge other power systems, such as for example the Tesla Wall&#x2122;, when solar or wind power is not available or as a supplemental power source working in conjunction with solar and wind power systems.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0123">The MCPS can generate 120 v or 240 v AC, or comparable DC, through inversion and/or rectification, providing flexible alternatives depending on each power requirement. The MPCP can also be configured for use as an AC power source for all types of vehicles or conditions mentioned above, whether they are open-loop or closed-loop system, for cars, vans, pickup trucks, RV's, buses, taxis, limousines, delivery trucks, semi's, trains, boats, yachts, cruise lines, freighters, helicopters, drones, air taxi's, submarines, space stations, space vehicles, or other suitable space apparatuses, systems, vehicle, and/or objects.
