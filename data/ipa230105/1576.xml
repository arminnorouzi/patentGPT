In the present automatic polishing device, there is performed an action of moving a tool based on a polishing force measurement device for measuring a polishing force applied to the polishing tool to thereby keep the polishing force constant, namely an action using force control. Therefore, it is possible to perform a polishing task while keeping the polishing force in a value as close to a predetermined value as possible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When performing the force control, it is necessary to set force control parameters to an appropriate value. However, in this setup, there is adopted a method of repeating the task while changing the force control parameters to search for the force control parameters suitable for the polishing task, and

It should be noted that the installation place of the force detection section <b>19</b> is not limited to the sixth arm <b>17</b>, namely the arm located at the farthest to the tip side, and can be, for example, another arm, an area between the arms adjacent to each other, or a place below the platform <b>11</b>, or it is possible to provide the force detection section <b>19</b> to each of the joints.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is possible to detachably mount the end effector on the force detection section <b>19</b>. In the present embodiment, the end effector <b>20</b> is formed of a polishing tool for performing polishing. The end effector <b>20</b> has a grinder at the tip, and polishes a work W<b>1</b> with the grinder making contact with the work W<b>1</b> while rotating.

Further, by figuring out a type, in particular a length, of the end effector <b>20</b> in advance, it is possible to figure out an amount of an offset between the tool center point TCP and the control point CP. Therefore, it is possible to figure out the position of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system.

In the force trigger control, the force detection is performed by the force detection section <b>19</b>, and the robot arm <b>10</b> is made to perform an operation such as a displacement or a change in posture until a predetermined force is detected by the force detection section <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The impedance control includes imitation control. First, in a brief description, the operation of the robot arm <b>10</b> is controlled in the impedance control so as to keep the force applied to the tip portion of the robot arm <b>10</b> to a predetermined force as precisely as possible, namely so as to keep the force in a predetermined direction detected by the force detection section <b>19</b> at the target force f<sub>St </sub>as precisely as possible. Thus, for example, when the impedance control is performed on the robot arm <b>10</b>, the robot arm <b>10</b> performs an operation imitating an external force applied from the object or an operator with respect to the predetermined direction. It should be noted that the target force f<sub>St </sub>includes 0. For example, as one of the settings when performing the imitation operation, it is possible to set the target value to &#x201c;0.&#x201d; It should be noted that it is possible to set the target force f<sub>St </sub>to a numerical value other than 0.

The command using the target positional posture S<sub>t </sub>and the target force f<sub>St </sub>as parameters is set for every step of the operation performed by the robot <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The drive control section <b>3</b>B controls the first arm through the sixth arm <b>17</b> so that the target positional posture S<sub>t </sub>and the target force f<sub>St </sub>thus set are achieved at the tool center point TCP.

Here, the character &#x201c;S&#x201d; is assumed to represent any one of the directions (X, Y, and Z) of the axes defining the robotic coordinate system. Further, it is also assumed that the character S also represents a position in the S direction. For example, in the case of S=X, the X direction component of the target position set in the robotic coordinate system becomes S<sub>t</sub>=X<sub>t</sub>, and the X direction component of the target force becomes f<sub>St</sub>=f<sub>Xt</sub>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, in the drive control section <b>3</b>B, when the rotational angles of the motor M<b>1</b> through the motor M<b>6</b> are obtained, the coordinate conversion section <b>31</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> converts the rotational angles into the positional posture S (X, Y, Z, U, V, or W) at the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system based on the correspondence relationship.

It should be noted that the control device <b>3</b> stores a correspondence relationship which defines a direction of a detection axis in a sensor coordinate system of the force detection section <b>19</b> for every positional posture S of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system. Therefore, it is possible for the control device <b>3</b> to identify the acting force f<sub>S </sub>in the robotic coordinate system based on the correspondence relationship with the positional posture S of the tool center point TCP in the robotic coordinate system. Further, the torque acting on the robot <b>1</b> can be calculated from the acting force f<sub>S </sub>and a distance from the contact point to the force detection section <b>19</b>, and is identified as a torque component. It should be noted that when the end effector <b>20</b> makes contact with the work W<b>1</b> to perform an operation, the contact point can be assumed as the tool center point TCP.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The correction section <b>33</b> performs a gravity compensation on the acting force f<sub>S</sub>.

The inertia compensation means elimination of a component of a force or a torque caused by an inertial force from the acting force f<sub>S</sub>. The acting force f<sub>S </sub>on which the inertia compensation has been performed can be assumed as a force other than the inertial force acting on the robot arm <b>10</b> or the end effector <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The force control section <b>34</b> performs the impedance control. The impedance control is active impedance control which realizes an imaginary mechanical impedance with the motor M<b>1</b> through the motor M<b>6</b>. The control device <b>3</b> performs such impedance control when performing direct teaching and a step in a contact state in which the end effector <b>20</b> receives a force from the work W<b>1</b> as an object such as a fitting task of the work W<b>1</b>, a screwing task, or a polishing task. It should be noted that besides such a step, by performing the impedance control when, for example, a human makes contact with the robot <b>1</b>, it is possible to enhance the safety.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the impedance control, the target force f<sub>St </sub>is substituted into a motion equation described later to derive the rotational angles of the motor M<b>1</b> through the motor M<b>6</b>.
