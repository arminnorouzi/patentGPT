As noted above, droplet microfluidics can be used for a variety of applications. Droplet microfluidics can allow one to compartmentalize a bulk sample into a large number of subsamples and perform detailed analysis on each subsample. However, once compartmentalized it may be difficult to de-compartmentalize the contents of the droplets individually and transfer these contents into wells of a multi-well plate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The droplet delivery system of the present disclosure provides individual droplet de-emulsification. Moreover, the droplet delivery system can eject many droplets simultaneously into respective wells. As a result, the contents of each droplet can be mapped for various different applications. The droplet delivery system can be used for biological analysis as well as printing applications.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one example, the droplet delivery system may contain a particle in a droplet of a first liquid that is carried in a second liquid within the droplet delivery system. For example, the second liquid may be in a continuous phase and the first liquid may be dispersed in the second liquid. In an example, the first liquid and the second liquid are immiscible.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The droplet delivery system may use a heating element to create a vapor bubble or steam bubble. The energy released from the steam bubble can be used to eject the droplet of the first liquid through a bore. A minimal or negligible amount of the second liquid may be ejected along with the droplet of the first liquid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some examples, the bores may be shaped to help position the droplet over the heating element. Sensors can be used to control operation of the heating element when the droplets are in position over the heating element. In addition, electrical and/or mechanical components can be used to manipulate or steer the droplets toward the bores of the droplet delivery system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example block diagram of a system <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. In an example, the system <b>100</b> may include a droplet delivery apparatus <b>102</b> (also referred to herein as apparatus <b>102</b>), an analysis system <b>104</b>, a droplet/fluid reservoir <b>112</b>, and a controller <b>110</b>. In one example, the apparatus <b>102</b> may include an interior volume formed by the outer walls of the apparatus <b>102</b> (e.g., side wall, top, and bottom). The interior volume may include channels that contain a fluid that carries droplets <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an example, a side of the apparatus <b>102</b> may include a plurality of bores or openings <b>106</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>106</b><sub>n </sub>(hereinafter also referred to individually as an opening <b>106</b> or collectively as openings <b>106</b>). The apparatus <b>102</b> may include mechanisms (discussed in further details below) that can eject the droplets <b>108</b> out of the openings <b>106</b> without ejecting the fluid that is in the channels of the apparatus <b>102</b>. For example, the droplets <b>108</b> may be contained in a fluid that is fed through the apparatus <b>102</b> from the droplet/fluid reservoir <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an example, the analysis system <b>104</b> may be a well plate that may include a plurality of wells. The wells may be aligned with each opening <b>106</b> and the droplets <b>108</b> may be ejected into respective wells of the well plate. The droplets <b>108</b> may then be tracked, sorted, and identified in the well plate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another example, the analysis system <b>104</b> may be a chamber or volume for further analysis. The droplets <b>108</b> may be ejected into an analysis chamber for further observation, processing, or study.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another example, the analysis system <b>104</b> may be another apparatus <b>102</b> that contains another fluid to carry the droplets <b>108</b> to another section for analysis. In an example, the analysis system <b>104</b> may be a combination of the above possibilities. For example, some openings <b>106</b> may eject the droplets <b>108</b> into well plates, other openings <b>106</b> may eject the droplets <b>108</b> into an analysis chamber, and other openings <b>106</b> may eject the droplets <b>108</b> into another section of the apparatus <b>102</b> that contains a different fluid for carrying the droplets <b>108</b> to another area for analysis. Although the analysis system <b>104</b> is shown as being separated from the apparatus <b>102</b> for ease of explanation, it should be noted that the analysis system <b>104</b> may be part of the apparatus <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example, the controller <b>110</b> may be communicatively coupled to various components within the apparatus <b>102</b> to control the ejection of the droplets <b>108</b>. The controller <b>110</b> may control a heating element, sensors, monitoring systems, and the like (discussed in further details below) to eject the droplets <b>108</b> out of the openings <b>106</b>. The controller <b>110</b> may selectively eject a droplet <b>108</b> out of a particular opening <b>106</b>, may eject several droplets <b>108</b> out of a subset of the openings <b>106</b>, or may eject droplets <b>108</b> out of all of the openings <b>106</b> simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example, the system <b>100</b> may include a recirculation loop <b>113</b>. The recirculation loop may allow droplets <b>108</b> that were not trapped by a respective opening <b>106</b> to be recirculated through the apparatus <b>102</b> until the droplets <b>108</b> are trapped adjacent to a respective opening <b>106</b>. In an example, when the droplets <b>108</b> are ready for ejection, the controller <b>110</b> may activate a heating element to eject the droplets <b>108</b> through the openings <b>106</b> and into the analysis system <b>104</b>, as discussed in further details below.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example cross-sectional view of the apparatus <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a channel <b>120</b> that is formed between two sides of the apparatus <b>102</b>. The droplet <b>108</b> may be fed through the channel <b>120</b> toward an opening <b>106</b>. In one example, the internal sides of the channel <b>120</b> may be hydrophobic. In one example, the sides of the opening <b>106</b> may be hydrophilic.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one example, the droplet <b>108</b> may be carried via a fluid <b>114</b>. The fluid <b>114</b> may be a continuous phase liquid and the droplet <b>108</b> may be a liquid that is dispersed in the fluid <b>114</b>. A surfactant may be used to stabilize the droplet <b>108</b> in the fluid <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the droplet <b>108</b> and the fluid <b>114</b> are selected to be different immiscible liquids. For example, the droplet <b>108</b> may be a liquid that does not mix with the fluid <b>114</b>. Examples of immiscible liquids may include water and oil, alcohols in oil, and the like. For example, the droplet <b>108</b> may be a water droplet and the fluid <b>114</b> may be an oil. Thus, the droplet <b>108</b> may flow in the fluid <b>114</b> without bursting and mixing into the fluid <b>114</b>. It should be noted that other types of immiscible fluid combinations can be used.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an example, the droplet <b>108</b> may include a particle <b>116</b>. The particle <b>116</b> may be a biological cell, a print fluid, and the like. The droplet <b>108</b> may be used for a variety of different applications depending on the particle <b>116</b> that is contained in the droplet <b>108</b>. For example, the particle <b>116</b> may be a cell or biological matter. The droplets <b>108</b> may allow for sample preparation, single cell isolation, highly multiplexed chemical reaction assays (e.g., polymerase chain reactions), and the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another application, the particle <b>116</b> may include unstable print fluids. For example, the pint fluids may include a suspension of particles including pigment particles, unstable suspensions, or particle slurries. The print fluids may be ejected without the surrounding oil in precise amounts. As a result, the print fluid may dry faster as less fluid overall is dispensed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example, the droplet <b>108</b> may flow toward the opening <b>106</b> via a variety of different mechanisms. In an example, the droplet <b>108</b> may be drawn towards the opening <b>106</b> via a &#x201c;cheerios&#x201d; effect caused by the surface tension of the droplet <b>108</b> and the surface tension of the fluid <b>114</b> at the opening <b>106</b>. For example, the opening <b>106</b> may cause the fluid <b>114</b> to form a meniscus against the walls of the opening <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the gradual evaporation of the fluid <b>114</b> at the opening <b>106</b> may cause the fluid <b>114</b> to flow towards the opening <b>106</b>, thereby also drawing the droplet <b>108</b> towards the opening <b>106</b>. When the droplet <b>108</b> encounters the meniscus at the opening <b>106</b>, capillary forces of the meniscus may pull the droplet <b>108</b> towards an immobile part of the meniscus (e.g., a portion of the meniscus against the sidewalls of the opening <b>106</b>). In other examples, discussed herein, mechanical and electrical devices can be used to manipulate the movement of the droplets <b>108</b> within the channel <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the droplet <b>108</b> arrives at the opening <b>106</b>, the droplet <b>108</b> may be attracted to the sidewalls of the opening <b>106</b>. The droplet <b>108</b> may be positioned to be aligned with a heating element <b>118</b>. The heating element <b>118</b> may be aligned with the opening <b>106</b> and be located on an opposite side of the channel <b>120</b> relative to the opening <b>106</b>. In other words, if the opening <b>106</b> is on a top side of the channel <b>120</b>, then the heating element <b>118</b> may be located on a bottom side of the channel <b>120</b> opposite the opening <b>106</b>. In an example, the heating element <b>118</b> may be aligned such that a center of the heating element <b>118</b> may be approximately aligned with a center of the opening <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example, the heating element <b>118</b> may be any type of energy source that can locally heat the liquid of the droplet <b>108</b>. For example, the heating element <b>118</b> may be an inductive heater or a thermal inkjet (TIJ) resistor. In an example, the TIJ resistor may include a controllable circuit that includes a resistor heater. When the circuit is activated, current may flow through the resistor heater to generate heat.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an example, the droplet <b>108</b> dispersed in the fluid <b>114</b> may be selected to be a liquid that can be easily jetted by the TIJ resistor when the heating element <b>118</b> is a TIJ resistor. Examples of liquids for the droplet <b>108</b> that can be easily jetted by the TIJ resistor may include water, alcohols, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an example, the heat generated by the heating element <b>118</b> may create vapor bubbles in the liquid of the droplet <b>108</b> near the heating element <b>118</b>. The vapor bubbles may move the droplet <b>108</b> towards the opening <b>106</b>. As the vapor bubbles burst, the force exerted by the bursting vapor bubbles may eject the droplet <b>108</b> out of the opening <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, the fluid <b>114</b> may have a vapor pressure that is lower than the vapor pressure of the liquid used to form the droplet <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the fluid <b>114</b> may have a boiling point that is higher than a boiling point of the liquid that forms the droplet <b>108</b>. Thus, the heat flux generated by the heating element <b>118</b> is to be such that the heat flux is not enough to input power into the fluid <b>114</b>, but enough to input sufficient power into the droplet <b>108</b> to generate an expanding vapor bubble in the droplet <b>108</b>. As a result, the expanding vapor bubble may have sufficient momentum to push the droplet <b>108</b> out of the opening <b>106</b>. Thus, the droplet <b>108</b> may be ejected without ejecting any, or a very minimal amount, of the fluid <b>114</b>. In other words, the apparatus <b>102</b> may provide an efficient de-emulsification of the droplet <b>108</b> from the fluid <b>114</b> for a variety of different applications.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The diameter or size of the opening <b>106</b> may be a function of the size of the droplets <b>108</b>. The diameter of the opening <b>106</b> may also be selected to form a desired meniscus of the fluid <b>114</b> without allowing the fluid <b>114</b> to escape. Thus, the diameter of the opening <b>106</b> may be sized to allow the droplets <b>108</b> to be ejected through the opening <b>106</b>, but not large enough to allow the fluid <b>114</b> to freely flow out of the opening <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an example, the diameters of the individual openings <b>106</b> may be the same size. In another example, the diameter of the openings <b>106</b> may be different sizes. For example, different sized droplets <b>108</b> may be fed into the fluid <b>114</b> and through the channel <b>120</b>. The different sized diameters of the openings <b>106</b> may be used to capture different sized droplets <b>108</b> for ejection in a non-homogeneous emulsion of droplets <b>108</b> in the fluid <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an example, the controller <b>110</b> may be communicatively coupled to the heating element <b>118</b>. In an example, a respective heating element <b>118</b> may be aligned with each opening <b>106</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>106</b><sub>n</sub>. The controller <b>110</b> may independently control each heating element <b>118</b>. As a result, when a droplet <b>108</b> is to be ejected from a particular opening <b>106</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>106</b><sub>n </sub>the controller <b>110</b> may activate the respective heating element <b>118</b> to eject the droplet <b>108</b> from the desired opening or openings <b>106</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>106</b><sub>n</sub>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of a cross-sectional view of the example cell trapping array with the TIJ resistor array and a sensor of the present disclosure. In an example, the opening <b>106</b> may include features <b>122</b> to trap the droplet <b>108</b>. The features <b>122</b> may be mechanical features. For example, the opening <b>106</b> may include a cut-out, an indentation, or a stepped bore. As the droplet <b>108</b> moves towards the opening <b>106</b>, the droplet <b>108</b> may expand into the large volume created by the features <b>122</b> and be temporarily trapped between the opening <b>106</b> and the heating element <b>118</b>. Although the features <b>122</b> are illustrated as rectangular shaped cut-outs, it should be noted that the features <b>122</b> may be any shape.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although the features <b>122</b> are illustrated as being on a top side of the channel <b>120</b> near the opening <b>106</b>, it should be noted that the features <b>122</b> may also be on a bottom side of the channel <b>120</b> near the heating element <b>118</b>. For example, a cut out may be added around the heating element <b>118</b>. In one example, the features <b>122</b> may be located on both a top side and a bottom side of the channel <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example, the droplet <b>108</b> may be trapped by changing a surface contact angle of the droplet <b>108</b> to the sidewalls of the opening <b>106</b>. For example, features <b>122</b> can be used to change the surface contact angle, or other methods (e.g., electrical manipulation of the contact angle via electrodes) may be used.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the apparatus <b>102</b> may also include a sensor <b>124</b>. The sensor <b>124</b> may be an impedance sensor or a capacitive sensor. In other examples, the sensor <b>124</b> may be an optical sensor.
