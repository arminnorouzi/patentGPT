For example, a processing system having at least one processor may obtain usage volume information for a plurality of endpoint devices for at least one cell site of a cellular network. For each of the plurality of endpoint devices the usage volume information may comprise a total usage volume via the cellular network in a given time period and a usage volume via the at least one cell site in the given time period. The processing system may next determine at least one earning value of the at least one cell site in the given time period based upon a summation of an earning metric of each of the plurality of endpoint devices for the at least one cell site, where the earning metric comprises for each of the plurality of endpoint devices: a total earning for the cellular network from the endpoint device in the given time period times a ratio of the usage volume via the at least one cell site in the given time period divided by the total usage volume via the cellular network in the given time period. The processing system may then train a prediction model to predict an earning value of a new cell site, where the prediction model is trained based upon geospatial features of the at least one cell site as predictor factors of the at least one earning value of the at least one cell site, and determine a predicted earning value of the new cell site in a time interval via the prediction model, by applying geospatial features of the new cell site as inputs to the prediction model and obtaining the predicted earning value as an output of the prediction model.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, the present disclosure describes a method, computer-readable medium, and apparatus for identifying a second instance of a geospatial category within a candidate cell site and determining a predicted earning value of the candidate cell site in a time interval based upon at least a first earning value for at least a first instance of the geospatial category within at least one cell site and a scaling factor based upon a size of the at least the second instance and a size of the at least the first instance. For example, a processing system having at least one processor may obtain usage volume information for a plurality of endpoint devices receiving services from at least one cell site of a cellular network when determined to be present within at least a first instance of at least a first type of geospatial category within the at least one cell site, where for each of the plurality of endpoint devices the usage volume information comprises a total usage volume via the cellular network in a given time period and a usage volume when determined to be present within the at least the first instance of the at least the first type of geospatial category within the at least one cell site in the given time period.

The first earning metric may comprise for each of the plurality of endpoint devices: a total earning for the cellular network from the endpoint device in the given time period times a ratio of the usage volume when determined to be present within the at least the first instance of the at least the first type of geospatial category in the given time period divided by the total usage volume via the cellular network in the given time period.

There are high costs involved in the design and planning of networks, purchase of network elements, installation of elements like antennas, fibers, wireless connections, routers, switches and other network functions. The maintenance and operations of the network incur high costs as well, including costs like power, cooling, taxes, fees, etc. Thus, network planning decision may be based not just on the cost of the equipment and the installation, but also on the potential earning from each item. However, it is challenging to attribute network revenues across individual pieces of equipment. In addition, it may be even more challenging to forecast the potential earning when deploying new equipment, such as a new network access point. Examples of the present disclosure learn the earning value of a given cellular network access point (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), or the like) based on the users that it serves. Network access points may broadly comprise at least one antenna (or antenna array), may comprise multiple antennas in one or more sectors, and may further include towers, rooftop installations, and/or indoor solutions that contain several antennas (broadly, &#x201c;network access points&#x201d;). Thus, given a location in which there is no network access point, the present disclosure forecasts the potential earning value of a new network access point at such location. Based on this potential earning value, network configuration decisions of the cellular network may be made. In one example, to estimate the value of an existing network access point, the present disclosure may first identify the customers (or endpoint devices) the network access point serves, and obtain usage volume information for such endpoint devices, from which the effect of the network access point on the total revenue of the network may be determined. While there is some lack of precision in this estimate, the earning values can still support decision making since network access points may be compared to one another.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To illustrate, in one example, let C be the set of all the customers (e.g., subscribers) of the cellular network. In one example, there are two types of customers with two different payment methods&#x2014;prepaid and postpaid. Let p(c) be the monthly payment of a postpaid customer c in C. Similarly, let p(c) be the cost of a prepaid card for a prepaid customer. To estimate the earning of each network access point, in one example, the present disclosure divides the gain from the customers between the network access points the customers are using, according to the amounts of use.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Earning by call number&#x2014;In one approach, the present disclosure estimates a contribution of network access point to a revenue from an endpoint device in a given time period (e.g., a monthly billing cycle) as follows. Given a network access point (e.g., an antenna) A, for each postpaid endpoint device d, the payment of d is multiplied by the ratio of (1) the number of calls of dthat were served by A and (2) the total number of calls of d. This can be the monthly average for the postpaid customer. For a prepaid endpoint device d, the prepaid value is multiplied by the ratio of the number of calls of dusing network access point A and the total number of calls of d. In one example, both options are represented by Equation 1:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Earning of <i>A </i>from <i>d</i>=payment per device <i>d</i>*(calls of <i>d </i>through <i>A</i>/total number of calls of <i>d</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">Earning by data volume&#x2014;In a second example, instead of relating to the number of calls, the effect of a network access point on the revenue from a given endpoint device is measured by the volume of data served via the network access point; that is, the total gigabytes (or other metrics) of information that the network access point sent and received from the endpoint devices in the area of coverage of the network access point (broadly a &#x201c;cell site&#x201d;). Given a network access point A, for each postpaid endpoint device d, the payment of d is multiplied by the ratio of (1) the data that device d sent or received via A and (2) the total amount of data that d sent or received via any network access point. This can be based on the monthly average. For a prepaid endpoint device d, the prepaid value is multiplied by the ratio of volume of data transfer of d via network access point A and the total volume of data sent or received by d through any network access point. In one example, both options are represented by Equation 2:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Earning of <i>A </i>from <i>d</i>=payment per device <i>d</i>*(volume of data of <i>d </i>through <i>A</i>/total volume of data of <i>d</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Earning by service time&#x2014;In a third example, instead of relating to the number of calls, the effect of a network access point on the revenue from a given endpoint device is measured by service time; that is, the total time that the endpoint device was connected to the network access point and received service from it during the given time period. Given a network access point A, for each postpaid endpoint device d, the payment of d is multiplied by the ratio of (1) the time that endpoint device d received service by A and (2) the total time that d received service from any network access point. This can be based on the monthly average of the service time. For a prepaid endpoint device d, the prepaid value is multiplied by the ratio of the service time of d via network access point A and the total service time of d through any network access point. In one example, both options are represented by Equation 3:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Earning of <i>A </i>from <i>d</i>=payment per device <i>d</i>*(service time of <i>d </i>through <i>A</i>/total service time of <i>d</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 3<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">The service time that network access point A provides to endpoint device d can be measured as the time when there are active calls and data transfer from the endpoint device d to the network access point A, and from A to d. The service time can also be measured as the total time that the endpoint device was near the network access point and received connectivity service from it.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">Threshold&#x2014;For all three examples above (earning by call number, earning by data volume and earning by service time), in one example, if for some endpoint device d and network access point A the percentage of serviced calls by A among all calls of d or the percentage of data transfer or the percentage of service time by A per the entire service time to d exceeds a given threshold, the entire payment of d may be attributed to the earning of A. For instance, if endpoint device d conducts 70% of all calls in a given month via network access point A, then without network access point A, the owner of d will probably churn to a different network, so all the revenue from d can be attributed to network access point A.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">Total Earning&#x2014;The total earning of a network access point in a given time period is the sum of earning from all endpoint devices that it serves in the given time period. Thus, the total earning for the network access point may be computed as the sum of the contributions based on time, volume of data or number of calls, per any of Equations 1-3 above, summed over all endpoint devices served by the network access point in the given time period. In one example, for any given network access point the maximum value per any of Equations 1-3 may be selected as the earning value of the network access point for each endpoint device in the given time period. For instance, this may be represented by Equation 4.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Total earning for network access point <i>A=&#x3a3;</i><sub>all devices d</sub>(max{<i>E</i><sub>c</sub>(<i>A,d</i>),<i>E</i><sub>d</sub>(<i>A,d</i>),<i>E</i><sub>t</sub>(<i>A,d</i>)})&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 4<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0024" num="0019">In another example, when computing the total earning value of a network access point in a given time period, the maximum of E<sub>c</sub>(A,d), E<sub>d</sub>(A,d), E<sub>t</sub>(A,d) can be replaced by three averages or by a weighted average of the three metrics. For instance, a weighting may be set by a network operator according to the important of each one to the network operator, e.g., per Equation 5:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Total earning for antenna <i>A=&#x3a3;</i><sub>all devices d</sub>(<i>w</i><sub>c</sub><i>&#xd7;E</i><sub>c</sub>(<i>A,d</i>)+<i>w</i><sub>d</sub><i>&#xd7;E</i><sub>d</sub>(<i>A,d</i>)+<i>w</i><sub>t</sub><i>&#xd7;E</i><sub>t</sub>(<i>A,d</i>))/(3(<i>w</i><sub>c</sub><i>+w</i><sub>d</sub><i>+w</i><sub>t</sub>))&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0026" num="0020">For example, if it is important to provide coverage to devices at almost all times, the weight of E<sub>t</sub>(A,d) could be increased. If data usage is more important, than the weight on E<sub>d</sub>(A,d) could be higher than the other two weights.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0021">The foregoing describes examples of determining earning value per network access point for network access point having available data from which such a determination may be made. However, for network planning, this type of data does not exist for places where there are no network access points. Thus, as noted above, the present disclosure forecasts the earning value in different places for possible locations of new network access points.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0022">To illustrate, for a possible new network access point location, the present disclosure may utilize geospatial features of the area that is covered by the network access point, e.g., a cell, or cell site. In one example, geospatial information about the area is obtained from a detailed map and/or aerial photos of the area. In one example, the estimation involves evaluation of the number of users in the examined area and the amount of time such users may spend in that area (derived from the geospatial features). Based on these calculations, the potential earning value of the new network access point in a given time interval may be estimated. In accordance with the present disclosure, no customer identifying information is used, and the privacy of all users and all customers is strictly maintained.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0023">In one example, estimation is conducted through the following steps. First, earnings values of network access points having known data are calculated (e.g., as per the above). Next, the present disclosure may train a prediction model to predict an earning value of a new cell site/new network access point, where the prediction model is trained based upon geospatial features of cell sites of existing network access points as predictor factors of network access point earning value. The existing network access points may be selected from a threshold distance around the location of the new network access point, or a prediction model may be pre-trained for a particular zone or region of the network in which the new network access point may be deployed. The geospatial features may include a number of buildings of each of a plurality of building types of a given cell site, a size of the buildings of each of the plurality of building types of the given cell site, a length of roads of each of a plurality of road types of the given cell site, a volume of at least one non-building-predominated land type (e.g., park space, farmland, natural preserved space, etc.), and so on.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0024">The geospatial features may be determined from one or more maps including labels of geospatial features in the cell site, and/or may be determined from one or more aerial images. For instance, if the map(s) is/are incomplete, one or more aerial images may be applied to one or more ML-classifiers for detecting buildings in the area and their features, such as type of building, footprint, and estimated number of floors, for detecting road, road types, and their lengths, and/or for detecting non-building-predominated lands, the land types, and the areas/sizes of such spaces. In one example, the one or more ML-classifiers may comprise one or more deep neural networks (DNNs) (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN), region detection using CNN (R-CNN), Fast-CNN, etc.). In one example, the detection of a building and its type may use a first detection model and the extraction of each feature may use a different model. The ML-classifier models may be trained on aerial images for areas in which the information on buildings is complete and accurate (e.g., from the one or more maps). In one example, the present disclosure may determine the building's total floor area, e.g., by multiplying the area according to the building footprint by the number of floors in the building.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0025">It should be noted that the ML-classifier models for detecting geospatial features in aerial images are different from the prediction model that uses such geospatial features as predictors for an earning values of a network access point/cell site. In particular, the geospatial features of cell sites of existing network access points may be extracted from one or more maps and/or one or more aerial images. Then, these geospatial features and associated earning value for each of a plurality of existing network access points (or the associated coverage area/cell site) are used as examples to train the prediction model to predict (output) a forecast earning value given a set of input geospatial features. The prediction model may comprise, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN), or the like. The number of layers, the number of cells per layer, and so forth may be set based upon a variety of considerations, such as a desired accuracy, computation time, etc. However, such a prediction model may have a different form in accordance with the present disclosure, such as a support vector machine (SVM), e.g., a binary, non-binary, or multi-class classifier, a linear or non-linear classifier, and so forth. It should be noted that various other types of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and/or machine learning models (MLMs) may be implemented in examples of the present disclosure, such as k-means clustering and/or k-nearest neighbor (KNN) predictive models, support vector machine (SVM)-based classifiers, e.g., a binary classifier and/or a linear binary classifier (e.g., high revenue vs. low revenue network access points, where the cutoff may be predefined by the network operator), a multi-class classifier, a kernel-based SVM, etc., a distance-based classifier, e.g., a Euclidean distance-based classifier, or the like, and so on. For instance, geospatial features of an area may be represented as a vector or point in a feature space, and the earning value may be calculated based upon a distance of the vector/point to a separation hyperplane in the feature space (e.g., where the separation hyperplane may represent the cutoff between high earning value and low earning value as defined by the network operator). In one example, the MLA may incorporate an exponential smoothing algorithm (such as double exponential smoothing, triple exponential smoothing, e.g., Holt-Winters smoothing, and so forth), reinforcement learning (e.g., using positive and negative examples after deployment as a MLM), and so forth.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0026">Accordingly, for a new network access point, the coverage area/cell site (if the new network access point were deployed) is identified and geospatial features are extracted (e.g., in the same or similar manner as described above, using one or more maps and/or one or more aerial images). Applying these geospatial features as inputs to the trained prediction model, the prediction model may output a forecast earning value (for a given time period) for the new network access point if deployed at the selected location.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0027">In another example, estimation is conducted through the following steps. First, estimate the number of devices per building type and building size, e.g., for a building type like department store, train station, or office building estimate the number of devices in the place divided by the square footage of the building. This estimation is based on the count of unique devices seen in such types of buildings in areas where there are antennas/network access points.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0028">In one example, the present disclosure may first find all the buildings in the area. If the map (or maps) is/are complete, all the buildings should be in the map(s). If the map(s) is/are incomplete, one or more aerial images may be applied to one or more ML-classifiers for detecting buildings in the area and their features: type of building, footprint, and estimated number of floors. In one example, the one or more ML-classifiers may comprise one or more deep neural networks (DNNs) (e.g., a convolutional neural network (CNN), R-CNN, Fast-CNN, etc.). In one example, the detection of a building and its type may use a first detection model and the extraction of each feature may use a different model. The ML-classifier models may be trained on aerial images for areas in which the information on buildings is complete and accurate (e.g., from the one or more maps). In one example, the present disclosure may determine the building's total floor area, e.g., by multiplying the area according to the building footprint by the number of floors in the building.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0029">In one example, for each building type, the present disclosure may estimate the average time that an endpoint device is in the building. For example, the average stay time of an endpoint device may be 45 minutes in a department store, 9 hours in an office building, and 15 minutes in a train station. For each building, the present disclosure may estimate the number of calls that a device is performing, based on data from places where there are similar network access points. In addition, for each building, the present disclosure may estimate the volume of data that a device is consuming, based on data from places where there are network access points. Based on the above steps, the present disclosure may then compute an estimation of the number of devices, the number of calls per device, the volume of data, and the service time per device for buildings in the examined area.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0030">Similarly, in one example, the present disclosure may find the roads in the area, their lengths (and/or areas), and their types (e.g., highway, municipal road, service road, etc.). If the information is not available on the map(s), one or more ML-classifiers model may be deployed to discover this information from one or more aerial images of the area. In one example, the present disclosure may, for each road type, estimate the number of endpoint devices per distance, e.g., <b>100</b> devices per mile. This can be based on counts for roads that are already covered by an existing network access point. Next, the present disclosure may estimate the average service time, average data usage, and the average number of calls, per device and mile of road, for roads of different types. Based on the road lengths, road types, and density of devices on the road, the present disclosure may then estimate the number of devices, the service time, the data usage, and the number of calls.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0031">Lastly, the present disclosure may compute an estimated earning value of a new network access point based on (a) the average payment per device multiplied by the estimated number of devices and the average number of calls/service time per devices in buildings in the coverage area (e.g., cell site) of the new network access point, and (b) the average payment per device, the expected number of devices per road distance multiplied by the length of the roads in the area (e.g., in the cell site/coverage area), and the expected number of calls/service time per device per mile.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0032">Adoption of new technology&#x2014;There are sometimes different payment models based on technology. For instance, a 5G plan could have different payment model than a 4G plan. In that case, the estimation model may also account for the distribution of plan types in the analyzed area, and the expected adoption of new technologies. Both the adoption rate of new technologies and the distribution of technologies across devices may be determined based on statistics for areas where the information is available and using the numbers in similar areas. For example, if in a first area there is adoption rate of new technologies of 5% per year and a second area is similar to the first area, then the adoption rate of the first area may also be assigned to the second area. Similarity between areas is computed based on parameters such as: population density, type of area (e.g., urban, suburbs, rural), survey data regarding new technologies and early technology adoption estimates based on such survey data, types of usage and of applications in the area, if available (e.g., the distribution of data usage for streaming video, streaming audio, gaming, voice calls, text messages, etc., which can be based on surveys or real measurements), the type of existing cellular plans for people in the area (the distribution), and so forth. To find the effect of these features on similarity, an ML model may be trained based on places where similarity is known, and may then be applied to testing similarity in places where the information is missing. In addition, a telecommunication network operator may offer paid-for services that are provided using the network, such as a streaming media service. Customers may use these services at different locations for an additional fee. The predicted earning might take usage of such services and applications into account. The usage can be measured in areas where there are antennas, and a prediction model can be trained and applied to potential new cellular sites. Note that the existence of cellular reception might be required for accessing the service from the considered location and paying for the service.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0033">Seasonality&#x2014;Some of the computed values are affected by seasonality. For example, some tourist areas are very active during the summer but are not as active during other times of the year. Some places, like ski resorts, are more active during the winter than during other seasons. Some worship places can be more crowded during religious holidays than during workdays, and so on. One approach to cope with seasonality is to measure the average usage over a longer period of time, say a year, and to employ this metric in the calculations. Notably, using an average may give the same weight to times in which there is high activity and times where the activity is low. In one example, a weighted average may be used instead, where the earning computed for each time period is multiplied by a weight that expresses the significance of the earning during that time period. For example, if E<sub>1</sub>, . . . , E<sub>12 </sub>are the earning values for January, . . . , December, respectively, then the weighted computation of the earning may be calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i><sub>1</sub><i>&#xd7;E</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ . . . +w</i><sub>12</sub><i>&#xd7;E</i><sub>12</sub>, such that for all <i>i,</i>0&#x2264;<i>w</i><sub>i</sub>&#x2264;1 and <i>w</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ . . . +w</i><sub>12</sub>=1&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 6<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0034">For computing the earning values in places where there is seasonality, the number of users during different times may be determined. In places where there are nearby network access points, the estimation may be based on the number of devices seen at each time by the closest antenna and/or network access point to the location that is considered. For isolated places, like resorts, if there is no nearby antenna, or network access point, the estimation may be based on either surveys or by counting the number of cars in the area at different times. For example, counting the number of cars may be accomplished by applying an ML model like, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting cars, to one or more aerial images of the area of interest. According to the location type, the number of people per car may be estimated, and the estimated crowd size may be calculated by multiplication of the number of detected cars by the expected number of people per car. Other estimation methods of the number of people in the area at different times can be used as well.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0035">Costs&#x2014;As explained above, an EBITDA computation for a network access point may account not for just the earning, but also the costs of installing, operating, and maintenance of equipment in different places. It may include power costs, taxes, municipal and other fees, etc. These costs may be either known or estimated based on the costs in existing nearby network access points. These and other aspects of the present disclosure are described in greater detail below in connection with the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0036">To aid in understanding the present disclosure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> in which examples of the present disclosure for training a prediction model and determining a predicted earning value of a new cell site in a time interval by applying geospatial features of the new cell site as inputs to the prediction model and obtaining the predicted earning value as an output, and/or for identifying a second instance of a geospatial category within a candidate cell site and determining a predicted earning value of the candidate cell site in a time interval based upon at least a first earning value for at least a first instance of the geospatial category within at least one cell site and a scaling factor based upon a size of the at least the second instance and a size of the at least the first instance may operate.

In one example, telecommunication network <b>102</b> may combine core network components of a cellular network with components of a triple play service network; where triple-play services include telephone services, Internet services and television services to subscribers. For example, telecommunication network <b>102</b> may functionally comprise a fixed mobile convergence (FMC) network, e.g., an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network.

It should again be noted that the prediction model may be pre-trained for a region or zone of the system <b>100</b> in which the new cell site <b>189</b>/NAP <b>199</b> is being considered for deployment, or may be trained after the location of the new cell site <b>189</b> is selected for consideration. In the latter case, AS <b>104</b> may select data relating to cell sites/NAPs that are within a threshold distance as training (and/or testing) data for building the prediction model. For instance, data for at least cell site <b>181</b>/NAP <b>191</b> and cell site <b>182</b>/NAP <b>192</b> may be selected due to the proximity of these to the new cell site <b>189</b>. It should also be noted that the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is simplified and that in the same, other, further, and/or different examples, data from additional cell sites/NAPs may be used to train/build the prediction model.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0050">In a second example, e.g., in accordance with the example method <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> for identifying a second instance of a geospatial category within a candidate cell site and determining a predicted earning value of the candidate cell site in a time interval based upon at least a first earning value for at least a first instance of the geospatial category within at least one cell site and a scaling factor based upon a size of the at least the second instance and a size of the at least the first instance, AS <b>104</b> may alternatively calculate an earning value for each instance of each type of geospatial category within each of cell sites <b>181</b> and <b>182</b>, respectively. For instance, AS <b>104</b> may perform similar operations as described above. However, instead of tracking a number of calls, call duration, data volume, or connection time per NAP (or per cell site) and calculating an earning value of the NAP/cell site per endpoint device, in this case AS <b>104</b> may track a number of calls, call duration, data volume, or connection time per location (or per instance of each geospatial category) within each of cell sites <b>181</b> and <b>182</b>. For example, AS <b>104</b> may track a number of calls made by each unique endpoint device when determined to be present at the instance of building type <b>3</b> in cell site <b>181</b>, a number of calls made by each unique endpoint device when determined to be present at a first instance of building type <b>1</b> in cell site <b>181</b>, and also for a second instance of building type <b>1</b> in cell site <b>181</b>. A similar process may be applied to instances of building type <b>2</b>, road type <b>2</b>, and road type <b>3</b>, as described above. In one example, as also noted above, the data from which these metrics may be determined is stored in DB(s) <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0051">In one example, AS <b>104</b> may next derive models for each type of geospatial category, e.g., a linear model which scales based upon the size of an instance of the type of geospatial category. For instance, AS <b>104</b> may gather metrics per the above for each instance of each type of geospatial category for a plurality of existing cell sites (e.g., including at least cell sites <b>181</b> and <b>182</b>). Earning values of instances of a same type of geospatial category may be plotted or otherwise fitted to a linear prediction line which describes a ratio of the size of the instance to the earning value earned by the system <b>100</b> in a given time period for network usage from endpoint devices located at or within the instance. For example, on average, more revenue is derived from a large office building than a small office building, e.g., because the large office building generally has more people (and hence more subscribers/users making calls, using network data, etc.).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0052">Continuing with the present example, AS <b>104</b> may then determine all of the instances of geospatial categories in new cell site <b>189</b>, e.g., one instance of building type <b>1</b>, five instances of building type <b>2</b>, one instance of building type <b>3</b>, two instances of road type <b>1</b>, and one instance of a non-building predominated land (e.g., a park). For each instance of each type of geospatial category, AS <b>104</b> may also retrieve from one or more map(s) and/or determine from one or more aerial/overhead images, sizes of each instance. With this information and the linear models of each type of geospatial category, AS <b>104</b> may then determine a per-instance earning value during the given time period. The sum over all of the instances of different types of geospatial categories in cell site <b>189</b> may then be returned as the forecast earning value of the new cell site <b>189</b>/new NAP <b>199</b> for a time interval of the same duration as the given time period over which the base data from cell sites <b>181</b>, <b>182</b>, etc. is/are obtained.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0053">It should again be noted that in one example, models may be created for each type of geospatial category (e.g., different models for each building type, each road type, etc.) for a region or zone of the system <b>100</b>, in advance. However, in another example, the models may be created for each building type, each road type, etc.) after the candidate location for new cell site <b>189</b>/new NAP <b>199</b> is selected. For instance, the models for each building type, each road type, etc. may be built from data of cell sites/NAPs within a threshold distance from the new cell site <b>189</b>/new NAP <b>199</b>. In addition, this distance may vary depending upon whether the new cell site <b>189</b> is in a rural area, a suburban area, an urban area, etc. These and other aspects of the present disclosure are further discussed below in connection with the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0054">It should be noted that the system <b>100</b> has been simplified.

Thus, the scaling factor may be in accordance with the linear scaling model based upon the plurality of earning values and associated sizes or the plurality of instances of the first geospatial category.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0079">Similarly, the first geospatial category may be just one geospatial category for which instances are found in the candidate cell site. Thus, for example, the predicted earning value of the candidate cell site in the time interval may be further determined based upon the at least second earning value (e.g., as determined at optional step <b>360</b> and a second scaling factor based upon a size of the at least the third instance and a size of the at least the fourth instance), and so on for other instances of the same or different geospatial categories (if any). For instance, the processing system may determine a per instance earning value during the given time period. The sum over all of the instances of all of the types of geospatial categories in the candidate cell site may then be returned as the forecast earning value of the candidate cell site for the time interval.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0080">At optional step <b>390</b>, the processing system may select the candidate cell site for deploying at least one antenna in accordance with the predicted earning value. For instance, optional step <b>390</b> may be the same as or similar to optional step <b>280</b> of the method <b>200</b> discussed above.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0081">Following step <b>380</b>, or optional step <b>390</b>, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to step <b>395</b> where the method <b>300</b> ends.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0082">It should be noted that the method <b>300</b> may be expanded to include additional steps, or may be modified to replace steps with different steps, to combine steps, to omit steps, to perform steps in a different order, and so forth. For instance, in one example the processing system may repeat one or more steps of the method <b>300</b> for additional candidate cell sites or different locations for a same candidate cell site. In still another example, step <b>340</b> may precede step <b>320</b> (and similarly for optional step <b>360</b>). In this regard, it should be noted that in one example, the at least one cell site may be selected at step <b>320</b> using an incrementally expanding threshold distance until there is at least one or other minimum number of instances of each geospatial category for which an instance of the geospatial category is determined to be within the candidate cell site. In other words, if the candidate cell site is determine to have an instance of the first type of geospatial category, the threshold distance may be expanded until an existing cell site in the network is found that also has an instance of the first type of geospatial category.
