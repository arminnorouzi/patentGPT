In order to solve such a problem, it has been reported to utilize a copolymer containing a specific anionic structure and a specific cationic structure as a coating agent which can be coated with a simple and convenient operation to the surface and can provide an excellent ability to inhibit adhesion of biological substances to the circuit of the device substrate material (for example, glass, a metal-containing compound or a semi-metal-containing compound, or a resin, etc.) (for example, see Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since a microdevice is usually manufactured by adhering a circuit in which PDMS or glass is processed to a substrate made of glass or a resin an adhesive, the formed adhesive (or a cured product thereof) layer can also come into contact with the biological sample similarly to the surface of the circuit or substrate. Accordingly, it is desirable that the adhesive (or a cured product thereof) used for a device using a biological sample also has high hydrophilicity and biocompatibility.</p><heading id="h-0003"
