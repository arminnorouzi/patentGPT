The invention finds particular application as an internal heater for an electrically heated smoking system for heating an aerosol-forming substrate having a cavity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment, a heater for heating an aerosol-forming substrate includes a plurality of elongate heating elements arranged in an elongate array having a support end with a first dimension, a heating end with a second dimension and a middle portion with a third dimension. Preferably, the array is arranged to heat the substrate to form an aerosol. Also preferably, the third dimension is greater than the first dimension and greater than the second dimension.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A heater as described herein has the advantage that the heating elements can provide efficient heating of the substrate due to the contact with the substrate. The heating end may be inserted into a cavity of the aerosol-forming substrate while the support end opposite the heating end may remain outside (or near the outside) of the aerosol-forming substrate. The middle portion is between the support end and the heating end and may contact the aerosol-forming substrate. Because the middle portion of the array has the greatest dimension (which may be its diameter if the array has a generally circular or near-circular cross section), the elongate array can be easily inserted into the cavity of the aerosol-forming substrate at the heating end, while still providing good contact with the inside of the substrate. The heater is advantageous because the good contact with the substrate provides optimal heating of the substrate. Since the heating process is efficient, the temperature and power needed may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the heater has the advantage that any condensate that forms on the outside of the heating elements will be removed by contact with the inside of the substrate. The heater may additionally have the advantage that the temperature of the heating elements is high enough to allow for any condensate that is not removed by contact with the substrate to evaporate during the heating process. The elongate array also provides a robust arrangement for the heater, which reduces the likelihood that the heating elements will break.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the preferred embodiment, the heater may be used in an electrically heated aerosol-generating system. Preferably, the heater is an internal heater. However, the heater may also be an external heater.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the plurality of elongate heating elements is arranged in a substantially tubular array. That is to say, the array may be substantially tubular in shape. At least one of the first dimension, the second dimension and the third dimension may be a diameter of the array. Preferably the first dimension is the diameter of the tubular array at the support end. Also preferably the second dimension is the diameter of the tubular array at the heating end. Moreover, the third dimension is the diameter of the array in the middle portion. The diameter of the array may be measured through and substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the array. Alternatively, the heating elements are arranged in a substantially conical array. That is to say, the array may be substantially conical in shape.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the second dimension at the heating end is smaller than the first dimension at the support end. In the preferred arrangement, the heating end is in the form of a point. This facilitates easy insertion of the heating elements into a cavity of the aerosol-forming substrate. Preferably, the heating elements are curved between the support end, the middle portion and the heating end. In the preferred embodiment, the heating elements are curved towards one another to form a point at the heating end. In that case, the elongate array is preferably nose-cone shaped, and each heating element preferably has a curved, elliptical shape.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, the substantially elongate array has a generally circular cross section. However, this need not be the case and a generally rectangular, generally oval or other shaped cross section is also possible. In that case, the dimension of each of the support end, heating end and middle portion may include a measurement substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the array. The measurement may include the span of the array, the breadth of the array or the width of the array. Preferably, the dimension of each of the support end, heating end and middle portion includes the largest measurement substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the array which would be the limiting measurement if inserting the elongate array into an aerosol-forming substrate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the elongate array of heating elements extends from a collar at the support end. The collar may be substantially circular in cross section. However, the collar may also take a variety of other forms, for example, square, rectangular, oval or octagonal. In one embodiment, the collar includes a ring. In another embodiment, the collar includes an annular disc. The collar may be electrically conductive. Alternatively, the collar may be electrically insulating.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the plurality of heating elements are electrically connected to each other at the heating end. Also preferably, the plurality of heating elements are mechanically connected to each other at the heating end. The plurality of heating elements may be both electrically and mechanically connected to each other at the heating end.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the preferred embodiment, the dimension of the middle portion of the array is larger than an inside dimension of a cavity of the aerosol-forming substrate, such that, when the plurality of heating elements are inserted into the cavity of the aerosol-forming substrate, the heating elements are pressed towards each other so as to exert a force on the substrate. The dimension of the middle portion is preferably the diameter of the middle portion. The inside dimension of the cavity is preferably the inside diameter of the cavity.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the heating elements are pressed towards each other, they are preferably pressed towards the central axis of symmetry of the heater, that is to say, towards the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the elongate array. Preferably, the force exerted on the substrate is exerted in a direction away from the central axis of symmetry of the heater, that is to say, away from the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the elongate array. This arrangement further optimises the contact with the substrate, which increases efficiency of the heating process.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plurality of heating elements may include two heating elements. If the elongate array includes two heating elements, each heating element may be positioned away from its adjacent heating element by an angle of about 180&#xb0;, when viewed along the longitudinal axis of the heater. That is to say, the two heating elements may be substantially opposite one another. In that case, the dimension of each of the support end, the heating end and the middle portion may include the distance between the two heating elements measured substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. Alternatively, the plurality of heating elements may include three heating elements. If the elongate array includes three heating elements, each heating element may be positioned away from its adjacent heating element by an angle of about 120&#xb0;, when viewed along the longitudinal axis of the heater. In that case, the dimension of each of the support end, the heating end and the middle portion may include the distance between two of the three heating elements or another dimension measured substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, the plurality of heating elements may include four heating elements. If the elongate array includes four heating elements, each heating element may be positioned away from its adjacent heating element by an angle of about 90&#xb0;, when viewed along the longitudinal axis of the heater. In that case, the dimension of each of the support end, the heating end and the middle portion may include the distance between two of the heating elements measured substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, preferably two of the heating elements which are opposite one another.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The plurality of heating elements may include five, six, seven or eight heating elements. If the elongate array includes eight heating elements, each heating element may be positioned away from its adjacent heating element by an angle of about 45&#xb0; when viewed along the longitudinal axis of the heater. For any number of heating elements, the dimension of each of the support end, the heating end and the middle portion may include the distance between the two substantially opposite heating elements, measured substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the array.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the plurality of elongate heating elements preferably includes an electrically resistive material. Suitable electrically resistive materials include but are not limited to: semiconductors such as doped ceramics, electrically conductive ceramics (such as, for example, molybdenum disilicide), carbon, graphite, metals, metal alloys and composite materials made of a ceramic material and a metallic material. Such composite materials may include doped or undoped ceramics. Examples of suitable doped ceramics include doped silicon carbides, Examples of suitable metals include titanium, zirconium, tantalum and metals from the platinum group. Examples of suitable metal alloys include stainless steel, nickel, cobalt-, chromium-, aluminium- titanium- zirconium-, hafnium-, niobium-, molybdenum-, tantalum-, tungsten-, tin-, gallium-, manganese- and iron-containing alloys, and super-alloys based on nickel, iron, cobalt, stainless steel, Timetal&#xae; and iron-manganese-aluminium based alloys (Timetal&#xae; is a registered trade mark of Titanium Metals Corporation, 1999 Broadway Suite 4300, Denver Colo.).

For clarity, only six heating elements are shown. The heater is shown in cross section on the left hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The heater includes heating elements <b>207</b> and collar <b>205</b> as previously described, and additionally includes a substantially tubular frame <b>213</b>. The tubular frame may include one or more external heating elements on its inner surface, although this is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The aerosol-forming substrate <b>115</b> is shown schematically on the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.

It also maximizes heating efficiency if external heating elements are provided on the inner surface of frame <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Note that many of the features of the embodiments described above are interchangeable.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In operation, the heating elements of the heaters typically reach a temperature of less than about 500&#xb0; C. More preferably, the temperature reached ranges from about 300&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C. Even more preferably, the temperature reached is about 250&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The heaters shown in the drawings may be internal heaters. As used herein, the term &#x201c;internal heater&#x201d; refers to a heater in which the heating elements are arranged to be internal to or within the aerosol-forming substrate during use. In this way, any condensate that does form on the heating elements evaporates in the heating process, or is removed by contact with the substrate. In particular, this differs from an external heating element, in which the outer surface of each heating element may easily become dirty since it is never in contact with the substrate to remove any condensate. In the embodiments described which include a common pin <b>103</b>, some self-heating of the common pin <b>103</b> is acceptable because the heat will prevent condensate from forming on the surface of the common pin and even on the inside surfaces of the heating elements.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Alternatively, the heater may be an external heater. As used herein, the term &#x201c;external heater&#x201d; refers to a heater which at least partially surrounds the aerosol-forming substrate.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In addition, because the heater may be an internal heater, the heating process can be more efficient, Thus, less power may be required and the time between a consumer's puff and the aerosol being generated can be minimized. This is because the heating elements are internal to the aerosol-forming substrate during operation, so that most of the heat is used to heat the substrate and only a small amount of the heat is dissipated. In addition, unlike external heating elements, there is contact only with the substrate itself rather than, for example, an outer paper sleeve. This increases efficiency and also reduces the likelihood that undesirable flavors are released.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The heaters shown in the drawings are optimized when used with an aerosol-forming substrate having a substantially conical or tubular shape. For example, the substrate may include a conical or tubular shaped mat of tobacco material which defines a cavity for receiving the heating elements. Preferably, the heater and substrate are sized such that the heating elements need to be pressed inwards slightly in order to be inserted into the tubular or conical substrate. This results in an outward force being exerted by the heating elements on the inside wall of the substrate, which ensures good contact with the substrate. This may also assist in keeping the heating elements in place in the substrate. The tubular substrate may be formed in a rod of smoking material, such as in a cigarette.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>11</b>, and <b>13</b></figref>, the heating elements are shown with a generally elliptical shape, that is to say, bowed outward along their length. The heater has a first dimension at the support or collar end (marked A), a second dimension at the heating end (marked B) and a third dimension at the middle portion (marked C). (Because the heater in the drawings has a substantially circular cross-section, those dimensions are diameters.) This means that the largest diameter of the assembled heater is at the middle portion, around the center of the heating elements. This ensures a good contact with the substrate. Also preferably, the diameter at heating end B is smaller than the diameter at support end A, which facilitates insertion of the assembled heater into a tubular substrate. Preferably, the heating elements have a stiffness that allows them to be inserted into the substrate and a flexibility that allows them to fill the cavity formed by the substrate and maintain contact with the substrate.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In this specification, the word &#x201c;about&#x201d; is often used in connection with numerical values to indicate that mathematical precision of such values is not intended.
