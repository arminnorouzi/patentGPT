While progress in this area has been made, there remains a need for foamed polyurethane compositions exhibiting improved physical properties in order to meet the requirements of specific applications for these materials.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">International patent application WO2020086470A1 filed Oct. 21, 2019 is commonly owned by the applicant and discloses polyol compositions useful in the preparation of high strength, temperature resistant non-foamed polyurethane materials.

Such monomeric polyols are illustrated by glycerol alkoxylated with 3, 4, 5, 6, or more equivalents of propylene oxide and for convenience abbreviated: glycerol 3&#xd7;PO, glycerol 4&#xd7;PO, glycerol 5&#xd7;PO, glycerol 6&#xd7;PO, etc. respectively; trimethylolpropane alkoxylated with 3, 4, 5, 6, or more equivalents of 1,2-butylene oxide and for convenience abbreviated: TMP 3&#xd7;BO, TMP 4&#xd7;BO, TMP 5&#xd7;BO, TMP 6&#xd7;BO, etc. respectively; pentaerythritol alkoxylated with 4, 5, 6, 7 or more equivalents of propylene oxide and for convenience abbreviated: PE 4&#xd7;PO, PE 5&#xd7;PO, PE 6&#xd7;PO, PE 7&#xd7;PO, etc. respectively; and dipentaerythritol alkoxylated with 5, 6, 7, 8 or more equivalents of propylene oxide and for convenience abbreviated: DiPE 5&#xd7;PO, DiPE 6&#xd7;PO, DiPE 7&#xd7;PO, DiPE 8&#xd7;PO, etc. respectively.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Exemplary monomeric polyols may also include alkoxylated polyether polyols comprising 3 or more primary hydroxyl groups, for example an alkoxylated monomeric polyol comprising 3 of more primary or secondary hydroxyl groups may be converted via alkoxylation as is known in the art with a sufficient amount a suitable oxirane such as ethylene oxide or a cyclic carbonate such as ethylene carbonate to a mixture of monomeric polyols in which the principal components are alkoxylated polyether polyols comprising 3 or more primary hydroxyl groups. Such alkoxylated polyether polyols may be single chemical species comprising 3 or more hydroxyl groups, but are typically mixtures of related chemical species.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The monomeric polyol may be tetrafunctional or greater and comprise 4 or more hydroxyl groups as is the case of pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and digylcerol (See additional illustrative monomeric polyols in Table 1 of this disclosure). The tetrafunctional polyol may comprise 4 or more secondary hydroxyl groups, for example an alkoxylated pentaerythritol or an alkoxylated dipentaerythritol, an alkoxylated digylcerol or an alkoxylated C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>carbohydrate (See additional illustrative monomeric polyols in Table 1 of this disclosure). Alkoxylated monomeric polyols constitute polyether polyols and include C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkoxylated polyols. Those skilled in the art will understand that C<sub>2 </sub>alkoxylated polyols may be produced by reaction of a base polyol such as pentaerythritol with, for example ethylene oxide or ethylene carbonate. The product C2 alkoxylated polyol will comprise 1 or more primary hydroxyl groups as a result. C3 and C4 alkoxylated polyols may comprise 1 or more primary, secondary and, in some instances, tertiary hydroxyl groups depending on the manner in which they are prepared. For example, a base polyol such as trimethylol propane when reacted with 1,3-propylene carbonate will produce a C3 alkoxylated polyol comprising 1 or more primary hydroxyl groups. Whereas, a base polyol reacted with 1,2-propylene carbonate or propylene oxide will produce a C<sub>3 </sub>alkoxylated polyol comprising 1 or more secondary hydroxyl groups. By way of further example, a base polyol such as dipentaerythritol reacted with 1,4-butylene carbonate will produce a C<sub>4 </sub>alkoxylated polyol comprising 1 or more primary hydroxyl groups. Whereas, a base polyol reacted with 1,2- or 1,3-butylene carbonate or butylene oxide will produce a C<sub>4 </sub>alkoxylated polyol comprising 1 or more secondary hydroxyl groups. By way of yet further example, a base polyol reacted with 2,2-dimethyl oxirane or 1,2-isobutylene carbonate will produce a C<sub>4 </sub>alkoxylated polyol comprising 1 or more tertiary hydroxyl groups. The presence of secondary hydroxyl groups as opposed to primary or tertiary hydroxyl groups may beneficially control the nature and chemical properties of the polyol composition. For example, during the preparation of the polyol composition the use of 1 or more monomeric polyols comprising chiefly, or exclusively, secondary hydroxyl groups may result in higher polyol components of the polyol composition wherein residues of the monomeric polyol may be predominantly linked by carbonate groups. Primary hydroxyl groups within the monomeric polyol may have a greater susceptibility to produce oxygen ether linkages between constituent residues of the higher polyol, be they residues of the monomeric polyol or residues of the polyhydroxylated aromatic compound.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The monomeric polyol may have a molecular weight sufficient to provide the requisite properties of both the polyol composition itself as well as foamable and foamed polyurethanes incorporating the polyol composition. The molecular weight of the monomeric polyol may be calculated from its hydroxyl number which can be determined experimentally according to ASTM E222. The monomeric polyol may have a molecular weight of less than 1000 g/mol, less than 800 g/mol, less than 600 g/mol, or less than 400 g/mol as determined from its hydroxyl number obtained using ASTM E222. The monomeric polyol may have a molecular weight of greater than 200 g/mol, greater than 450 g/mol, greater than 700 g/mol, or greater than 900 g/mol as determined from its hydroxyl number obtained using ASTM E222. The molecular weight may be the actual molecular weight of the monomeric polyol when the monomeric polyol is predominately a single molecular species, or may represent an average molecular weight when the monomeric polyol is a mixture of structurally related polyols such as is the case of Pluracol PEP450 polyols which are a mixture of structurally related monomeric polyols encompassing both alkoxylated homologues and diastereomers thereof. Alternatively, the molecular weight used to describe a monomeric polyol may be a nominal molecular weight of the polyol based upon a specific chemical structure assigned to such monomeric polyol. By way of example, a monomeric polyol which is a polyether polyol may be prepared by alkoxylation of a single, substantially pure base polyol (such as pentaerythritol) with propylene oxide, however, the product polyether polyol may comprise a mixture of structurally related polyols differing in molecular weight from one another by some regular amount (or multiple thereof), for example by 58 g/mol (the group molecular weight of a propyleneoxy repeat unit). Such a product polyether polyol is defined as a monomeric polyol for purposes of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The polyol composition may comprise at least one monomeric polyol and at least one higher polyol comprising 1 or more residues of such monomeric polyol.

Oxygen ether groups linking a monomeric polyol residue to a residue of a polyhydroxylated aromatic compound are thought to arise via loss of carbon dioxide from a higher polyol in which the monomeric polyol residue and the residue of a polyhydroxylated aromatic compound are linked by 1 or more carbonate groups. For example, higher polyol IIIb is thought to arise by loss of carbon dioxide from precursor higher polyol IIIa. It should be noted that appropriately controlling conditions under which the polyol composition is formed can minimize the formation of oxygen ether-linked higher polyols such as IIIb, IIId, IIIf, IIIh, IIIj, IIIl and IIIp. The carbonate-linked higher polyols such as IIIa, IIIc, IIIe, IIIg, IIIi, IIIk, IIIm, IIIn, IIIo, IIIq and IIIr are susceptible to further reaction with monomeric polyol with displacement of the residue of the polyhydroxylated aromatic compound to form a higher polyol containing the residues of 2 monomeric polyols linked together by a carbonate linkage. For example, reaction of higher polyol IIIa with monomeric polyol Ia may afford higher polyol Ia and free polyhydroxylated aromatic compound, in this instance bisphenol A.</p><p id="p-0115"

Illustrative higher polyols IVp-IVr represent aliphatic higher polyols IV comprising more than 3 monomeric polyol residues (z=2 or more) and in which X<sup>1 </sup>is a carbonate group or an oxygen ether group. Higher polyols IV are thought to arise via reaction of an initially formed higher polyol with a source of a carbonate group and a source of 1 or more additional monomeric polyol residues. For example, during the formation of the polyol composition an initially formed higher polyol such as IIa could react with an initially formed higher aromatic polyol such as IIIa which could serve both as the source of a carbonate group and a source of an additional monomeric polyol residue. Alternatively, a higher polyol such as IIa could react with a source of carbonate groups, such as an aliphatic or aromatic polycarbonate, in the presence of a monomeric polyol such as Ia.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0107">For convenience and simplicity, the fixed structures for higher polyols IV illustrated in Table 4 and throughout this disclosure may include structurally related homologues comprising residues of a monomeric polyol which is itself comprised of structurally related homologs.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0108">The presence of 1 or more polyhydroxylated aromatic compounds in the polyol compositions disclosed herein is optional.

viscous liquids at room temperature. The polyol compositions may have viscosities of less than 5000 cps, 2000 cps, 1000 cps or 200 cps at 150&#xb0; F. The polyol compositions may have viscosities of greater than 100 cps, 400 cps, or 1000 cps at 150&#xb0; F. While the chemical structures of the components of the polyol composition and their concentration may be the primary determinant of the utility of the polyol compositions in the preparation of foamable and foamed polyurethane compositions, the relatively low viscosity of the polyol compositions makes it possible to manufacture such foamed polyurethanes and articles comprising them using conventional manufacturing equipment, such as commercially available meter mixing systems, reaction injection molding machines and extruders. Commercially available meter mixing systems are ill suited for use with highly viscous polyols which may require specialized pumping and higher temperature handling capabilities than are currently available. The lower viscosity of the polyol compositions allows more complete mixing at lower temperature of the polyol composition (a), polyisocyanate (b) and blowing agent (c) components of a foamable polyurethane formulation prior to foaming of the formulation. This in turn may moderate the exotherm arising as the formulation foams and cures. Where foaming and curing takes place within a mold, lower in-mold peak exotherm temperatures make the use of FRP tooling more efficient by extending the useful life of such tooling. Similarly, cycle times may be reduced as a result of lower in-mold peak exotherm temperatures.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0116">Chromatographic and mass spectral analysis (See Experimental Part) of the polyol composition indicates a mixture of the starting monomeric polyol, higher polyols and, when present, free polyhydroxylated aromatic compound.

Additional exemplary carbonate sources include bis((2-oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl) carbonate (CAS No. 412312-38-0), (2-oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl methyl carbonate, (2-Oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl ethyl carbonate, (2-Oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl propyl carbonate and (2-Oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl butyl carbonate. Additional exemplary carbonate sources include phosgene equivalents such as carbonyl diimidazole, triphosgene and hexachloroacetone.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0119">Such polyol compositions may be prepared by contacting the source of carbonate groups with at least one monomeric polyol comprising 3 or more hydroxyl groups under conditions sufficient to cause a portion of the hydroxyl groups of monomeric polyol to displace the groups attached to a carbonyl group of the carbonate source. This may be effected by contacting 1 or more monomeric polyols with a source of carbonate groups in the presence of a catalyst, a promotor or both a catalyst and a promotor or no catalyst or promoter, at a temperature ranging from about 0&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C. When, for example, dimethyl carbonate is the source of carbonate groups at least a portion of the hydroxyl groups of the monomeric polyol displace methoxy groups initially attached to the carbonyl group resulting in the formation of methanol. Similarly, where the source of carbonate groups is di-t-butyl dicarbonate (BOC ON) transfer of 1 of the carbonate groups of the di-t-butyl dicarbonate to hydroxyl groups of the monomeric polyol results in the formation of 2 molecules of t-butyl alcohol and 1 molecule of CO<sub>2</sub>. The reaction may be driven towards completion by distilling residual components of the carbonate source (e.g. methanol and t-butanol) from the reaction mixture. The degree to which transfer of carbonate groups to the monomeric polyol and higher polyol species comprising residues of the monomeric polyol occurs can be determined by gravimetric and chemical analysis of the distillate. Proton NMR may be used for chemical analysis of the distillate. The product polyol composition may comprise a statistical mixture of the monomeric polyol and higher polyol species, the amounts of each being governed by the initial molar ratio of the monomeric polyol to carbonate groups of the carbonate source which are susceptible to transfer to the monomeric polyol and product higher polyol species containing resides of the monomeric polyol. Exemplary such initial molar ratios are greater than 1 to 1, greater than 1.5 to 1, greater than 2 to 1, greater than 3 to 1, and greater than 6 to 1. Exemplary such initial molar ratios are less than 15 to 1, less than 12 to 1, less than 9 to 1, less than 6 to 1, and less than 3 to 1. This initial molar ratio of the monomeric polyol to carbonate groups of the carbonate source which are susceptible to transfer may also be expressed as an initial molar ratio of hydroxyl groups of the monomeric polyol to susceptible carbonate groups of the carbonate source which may be greater than 4 to 1, greater than 6 to 1, greater than 8 to 1, greater than 10 to 1, less than 30 to 1, less than 25 to 1, less than 20 to 1, less than 15 to 1 and less than 12 to 1. Polycarbonate sources comprising multiple carbonate groups at least a portion of which are not susceptible to transfer include diorgano polycarbonates such as di-t-butyl dicarbonate which evolve a mole of carbon-dioxide for each mole of carbonate group transferred.

The reaction may advantageously be carried out in the presence of a catalyst, a promoter or a combination thereof. Illustrative catalysts and promoters include organic bases, inorganic bases, metal oxides, and organometallics. Catalysts are distinguished from promoters in that promoters are consumed during the formation of the polyol composition whereas catalysts are not consumed.

Exemplary chain terminators used in aromatic polycarbonates include phenolic compounds. Exemplary phenolic compounds include phenol, p-chlorophenol, p-tert-butylphenol, 4-(1,3-dimethyl-butyl)-phenol and 2,4,6-tribromophenol; and long chain alkylphenols, such as monoalkylphenols or dialkylphenols which contain a total of 8 to 20 carbon atoms in their alkyl substituents.

The initial reaction with the activating agent may be carried out at a lower or higher temperature than a subsequent conversion to the polyol composition, for instance of about 15&#xb0; C. or greater, about 25&#xb0; C. or greater, about 50&#xb0; C. or greater, or about 75&#xb0; C. or greater and about 250&#xb0; C. or less, about 200&#xb0; C. or less, about 175&#xb0; C. or less, or about 150&#xb0; C. or less.

By way of example, a polyhydroxylated aromatic polycarbonate may be heated in the presence of a catalyst together with a monomeric polyol comprising at least 3 hydroxyl groups at a temperature sufficient to cause the formation of mixed carbonate linkages between polyhydroxylated aromatic polycarbonate moieties of lower molecular weight than the polycarbonate used as the initial starting material. A mixed carbonate linkage may undergo further exchange with a hydroxyl group of the monomeric polyol to form a first higher polyol comprising 2 residues of the monomeric polyol linked by a single carbonate group. The first higher polyol may itself undergo further exchange with a mixed carbonate to afford additional higher polyol components. A mixed carbonate linkage may lose carbon dioxide and form aromatic ether linkages between a polycarbonate moiety and the residue of the monomeric or higher polyol participating in the mixed carbonate linkage but this may be minimized by careful control of the reaction conditions. As the reaction between the polycarbonate, the monomeric polyol and higher polyols continues the concentration of carbonate linkages not including a participating polyhydroxylated aromatic moiety increases as molecular weight of the remaining polycarbonate moieties decreases. When a sufficient quantity of the monomeric polyol is used, essentially all of the carbonate linkages in the polycarbonate may be converted into mixed carbonates, or carbonates between one or more monomeric polyol residues. The product polyol composition may comprise a statistical mixture of products resulting from chain scission of the polycarbonate starting material and may include a substantial amount of free polyhydroxylated aromatic compound as well as unconsumed monomeric polyol.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0133">The relative amounts of monomeric polyol and activating agent serving a source of carbonate groups of the higher polyols of the polyol composition are chosen such that physical and chemical properties of the polyol composition may be tuned as needed. The viscosity of the polyol composition may be controlled by varying the molar ratio of hydroxyl groups present in the starting monomeric polyol to carbonate groups, or equivalents thereof, in the activating agent. Where an aromatic polycarbonate serves as the source of carbonate groups in the polyol composition, the molar amount of activating agent is taken as moles of aromatic carbonate groups present in the given weight of the aromatic polycarbonate. Where the activating agent is bisphenol A polycarbonate, the molar amount of reactive carbonate groups is taken as the total weight of the polycarbonate divided by the group molecular weight of the repeat unit, 254 g/mol. The molar ratio of hydroxyl groups present in the starting monomeric polyol to carbonate groups, or equivalents thereof, in the activating agent may be greater than 5, greater than 6, or greater than 8. The molar ratio of hydroxyl groups present in the starting monomeric polyol to carbonate groups, or equivalents thereof, in the activating agent may be less than 14, less than 11, or less than 10. The molar ratio of the monomeric polyol to activating agent may be about 1.2:1 or greater, about 1.5:1 or greater or about 2:1 or greater. The molar ratio of the monomeric polyol to activating agent may be about may be about 4:1 or less, about 3:1 or less, or about 2:1 or less. Where a catalyst is present, any catalyst that is effective in causing the formation of the higher polyols may be used. The catalyst may be present in an amount based on the weight of the reaction mixture of about 0.0001% by weight or greater, about 0.01% by weight or greater, about 0.2% by weight or greater or about 1% by weight or greater. The catalyst may be present in an amount based on the weight of the reaction mixture of about 10% by weight or less, about 5% by weight or less, or about 2% by weight or less. Where a promoter is present, any promoter that is effective in causing the formation of the higher polyols may be used. The promoter may act to solubilize and/or compatibilize reactants used to create the polyol composition and enhance reaction rates of chemical transformations that result in the formation of the higher polyols. The promoter may be present in an amount based on the weight of the reaction mixture of about 0.01% by weight or greater, about 1.0% by weight or greater, or about 10% by weight or greater. The promoter may be present in an amount based on the weight of the reaction mixture of about 25% by weight or less, about 15% by weight or less, or about 9% by weight or less. The process may be performed wherein the reaction mixture comprises 1 or more polyhydroxylated amines, for example diisopropanol amine (DIPA) which contains a reactive secondary amine as well as 2 reactive secondary hydroxyl groups.

The polyurethane materials and articles containing them may be prepared using the techniques disclosed herein as well as art-recognized polyurethane polymer preparation and processing techniques such as those disclosed in E. N. Doyle's The Development and Use of Polyurethane Products (McGraw-Hill, Inc. 1971), Saunders' et al. Polyurethanes Chemistry and Technology, Parts I-II (Interscience Publishers), Saunders' Organic Polymer Chemistry (Chapman and Hall), J. M.

Foamable polyurethane formulations comprising one or more of the polyol compositions disclosed herein exhibit less intense reaction exotherms during curing than do analogous foamable polyurethane formulations lacking such polyol compositions. Articles comprising the foamed polyurethane compositions disclosed herein may exhibit excellent shrinkage resistance.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0137">The polyol compositions disclosed herein can be employed as in an easy to use A plus B plus C foamable polyurethane-forming formulation; component A comprising one or more polyisocyanates or polyisocyanate equivalents, component B comprising the polyol composition, and Component C comprising a blowing agent. Component B may be a mixture of 1 or more of the polyol compositions disclosed herein, and may contain 1 or more art recognized components such as polyurethane catalysts, mold release agents (both internal and external), and additional polyols. Component A may contain one or more polyisocyanates of any type, such as 1 or more polyisocyanate prepolymers and/or one or more monomeric polyisocyanates such as MDI and/or one or more oligomerized polyisocyanates such as HMDI trimer (CAS No. 3779-63-3), or component A may comprise one or more polyisocyanate prepolymers and be essentially free of monomeric and oligomeric polyisocyanates. Such A plus B plus C foamable polymer systems provide a useful alternative to systems affording relatively low strength foamed materials. Because the polyol compositions typically have a relatively low viscosity under normal processing temperatures, they may be combined with one or more polyisocyanates and injected at low pressure and moderate temperatures eliminating the need for expensive hydraulic presses and steel tooling such as are used in thermoplastic injection molding, and BMC and SMC processing. Low cost aluminum tooling or even gel-coat FRP tooling may be used advantageously due to the low injection pressure needed to fill the mold and the relatively low exotherm observed when the polyol compositions are reacted with polyisocyanates to form foamed polyurethanes. Significant advantages may attend the use of low cost tooling and processing equipment. Ease of processing during molding for example, will enhance the attractiveness of foamed polyurethanes comprising structural units derived from the disclosed polyol compositions relative to harder to process thermoplastics.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0138">Foamable polyurethane formulations comprising the polyol compositions disclosed herein may be processed into foamed polyurethane-containing parts using one or more known processing techniques including extrusion, meter mixing, Reaction Injection Molding (RIM), Poured Open Molding, Poured Closed Molding, Sprayed Open Molding, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0139">The polyol compositions disclosed herein may be incorporated into foamable polyurethane elastomer precursor formulations which provide for rapid set up times to produce foamed polyurethanes having enhanced physical properties required for certain applications.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0140">The foamable composition may comprise a polyisocyanate or residue thereof having structure VII</p><p id="p-0159" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>R<sup>4</sup>&#x2014;(NCO)<sub>m</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003; VII<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0160" num="0000">wherein R<sup>4 </sup>is a hydrocarbyl group and m is an integer, to form useful polyurethane materials.

latent polyisocyanate such as a blocked polyisocyanate such as are known in the art, with the polyol composition in the presence of 1 or more blowing agents to produce a foamable composition which upon curing in the presence of the blowing agent affords a foamed polyurethane composition. The polyol composition may be used as the crude reaction product in which it is formed, for example a crude reaction product obtained by contacting bisphenol A polycarbonate powder (2500 g) with a mixture of monomeric polyols Ia (7000 g) and Ie (500 g) in the presence of a metal hydroxide catalyst at a temperature in a range from about 140&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C. for a period of 20 minutes to 3 hours to provide a product polyol composition comprising either or both of monomeric polyols Ia and Ie, higher polyols derived from them, and free bisphenol A. The polyisocyanate may be combined with the polyol composition in amounts such that there is a slight excess of hydroxyl groups relative to isocyanate groups, thus assuring complete consumption of isocyanates VIIl and VIIn as the polyol composition is converted into a foamed polyurethane. The complexity of the polyol composition notwithstanding, such compositions can be converted to useful foamed polyurethane products without an intervening purification step. It may be useful to subject the polyol composition to a purification step prior to its conversion to a polyurethane. Exemplary purification steps include vacuum transfer removal of volatile components, filtration, basic and/or acidic extraction, microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, centrifugation, low temperature recrystallization, low temperature zone refining and trituration. If desired, essentially all of the free polyhydroxy aromatic compound, if present, in a polyol composition may be removed using a basic extraction protocol in which the polyol composition is dissolved in an organic solvent such as toluene, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, and the like, for which the monomeric polyol and higher polyol components have a high affinity, and thereafter washing the solution of the polyol composition with aqueous base to deprotonate and extract the relatively acidic polyhydroxy aromatic compound, thereby separating it from the relatively non-acidic monomeric polyol and higher polyol components which remain in the organic phase. The aqueous base should be sufficiently basic to deprotonate and extract all of the polyhydroxy aromatic compound in 1 or more washes, but not so basic as to cause significant loss of carbonate groups present in the higher polyol. The aqueous base may comprise a solution of a metal hydroxide or metal carbonate in water, for example a solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate in water containing greater than 1% and less than 20% by weight sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0145">In preparing the foamed polyurethane compositions and articles 1 or more additional polyols may be present in the foamable composition in addition to the monomeric and higher polyol components of the polyol composition.

In the case of the 3-part foamable polyurethane composition, also referred to herein as a reactive mixture, any single part, any 2 parts or all 3 parts of may contain a filler. Fillers are added for a variety of reasons and 1 or more types of fillers may be utilized in the foamable composition. Fillers may be added to reinforce the foamed polyurethane composition, to impart the appropriate viscosity and rheology and to strike a balance between cost and the desired properties of the foamed polyurethane composition and the cost of the foamed polyurethane composition. Reinforcing fillers, such as 1 or more carbon blacks, 1 or more clays or non-pigmented fillers, 1 or more thixotropes or combinations thereof may be used. Such fillers are used in a sufficient amount to impart an acceptable balance of viscosity and cost to the formulation and to achieve the desired properties of the foamed polyurethane composition. Among fillers useful for this purpose are clays, untreated and treated talc, and calcium carbonates. Clays include kaolin, surface treated kaolin, calcined kaolin, aluminum silicates and surface treated anhydrous aluminum silicates. Kaolin is also known as Kaolinite and comprises compounds represented by the chemical formula Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>, and it most often occurs as clay-sized, plate like, hexagonally shaped crystals. The clays can be used in any form which facilitates formulation of a foamable polyurethane composition and product foamed polyurethane composition having the desired properties. The foamable polyurethane composition may further comprise fillers which function as a thixotrope (rheological additive). Such thixotropes are well known and include fumed silica and the like. Fumed silicas include organically modified fumed silicas. The thixotrope may be added to the foamable polyurethane composition in a sufficient amount to give the desired rheological properties. Additional exemplary fillers include glass flake, glass fibers carbon fiber and basalt fiber. Additional exemplary fillers include electrically conductive fillers which may include carbon nanotubes, such as Tuball 301.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0149">The filler may be a fiber based material which may be present in woven and non-woven structures, individual fibers, rovings comprising a plurality of fiber strands, chopped fibers and the like. The filler may be applied to the outer surface of a foamed polyurethane article in order to further increase its dimensional stability and strength. The fillers may be glass, carbon, polymeric, metallic, ceramic and the like. The filler may be 1 or more of a continuous filament mat (CFM), a chopped or continuous strand mat (CSM), and an engineered stitched mat which may be used in single or multiple layers within a foamed polyurethane composite material prepared using the foamable compositions disclosed herein.

The reinforcing material may be cut to fit within a tool cavity. Slits may be made in the reinforcing material to prevent buckling or puckering of the reinforcing material during mold filling. The reinforcing material is disposed within the tool and the tool is closed. A foamable polyurethane composition comprising a first part comprising 1 or more polyisocyanates or latent polyisocyanates, a second part comprising 1 or more polyol compositions disclosed herein, and a blowing agent is prepared in a meter mixing system and is delivered in an uncured state to the mold heated to a temperature greater than about 180&#xb0; F. and less than about 220&#xb0; F. and allowed to cure as voids are created in the nascent polyurethane matrix by the blowing agent. The blowing agent may be contained within either or both of the first and the second part of the foamable polyurethane composition, or may be introduced as an independent third component. Cure times and peak in-mold exotherms vary but are typically less than about 30 minutes and less than about 260&#xb0; F. Cured composite parts may have excellent green strength and may be removed hot from the mold and may not require external support once removed in order to prevent deformation. The foamable polyurethane compositions disclosed herein, owing to the chemical structure and relatively low viscosity of the polyol composition component, flow easily around the reinforcing material as evidenced by the high quality (strength and appearance) of product composite parts and the mold fill times are the same whether a reinforcing material is present in the mold or not. Unfilled foamed polyurethane molded articles may be similarly prepared.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0152">The foamable polyurethane compositions, foamed polyurethane compositions and foamed articles may further comprise a plasticizer commonly used in polyurethane compositions.

Dividing the molecular weight of KOH expressed in mg/mol (56,100 mg/mol) by the hydroxyl number taken here to be 555 mg/mol affords an equivalent weight of 101 g PEP 450 per equivalent of OH group. Multiplying the equivalent weight by the number of OH equivalents (4 per mol of PEP 450) affords a molecular weight of 404 g/mol.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Mol Wt PEP 450=(Mol Wt KOH (mg/mol)/(OH Number (mg KOH/g PEP))&#xd7;4=404 g/mol<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0188" num="0163">Exemplary foamable compositions include NIAX Silicone L-6888 surfactant from Momentive.

Degassing is carried out by heating the polyol composition to approximately 160&#xb0; F. in a vacuum oven at slightly less than atmospheric pressure (at approximately 28 inches of mercury). The polyol composition is held within the vacuum oven until no further bubble evolution from within the liquid polyol composition is observed. This typically takes between 1 and 2 hours, depending on the polyol composition being degassed. Degassing of the polyisocyanate constituent is carried out similarly by adding a known amount of the polyisocyanate to a mixing cup and degassing separately from the polyol composition in a separate vacuum oven at 100 to 110&#xb0; F. at slightly less than atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0168">Cream time (CT), gel time (GT) and tack-free time (TFT) are used to characterize the performance of the foamed polyurethanes. The CT is a measure of the time it takes the foamable polyurethane composition to begin to rise, whereby time=0 seconds defines the time the precursors to the foamable composition are mixed together, and time=CT is the time at which the mixture begins to volumetrically expand from its initial volume. GT is defined as the time it takes the foamable composition to fully expand. GT is measured when both the lower section and the top section of the foamed polyurethane product exhibit hardness. The top section and the lower section of a typical foam are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> wherein the top section of the foam is the uppermost portion, or crown, of the foam in the photograph, and the lower section is that portion of the foam which has emerged from the mold but is disposed below the uppermost portion. This distinction is well illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by vertically foamed samples 0.8C1.5, 0.8C6, 1.1C11(A) and the 2 samples labeled 1.1C11. Sample 0.8C1 does not exhibit an accessible lower section. Hardness is considered achieved when considerable pressure must be exerted to indent the surface of the foamed polyurethane product. GT is invariably greater than the TFT. The TFT is measured using a wooden stick pressed very lightly on the accessible top and lower section surfaces of the foamed polyurethane. Typically, at time less than the TFT, the wooden stick adheres to the surface of the foamed polyurethane thereby causing a string-like feature to protrude from the surface of the foam attached to the wooden stick. This test is conducted at 30 second intervals following the complete rise of the foam. The TFT is assigned when the wooden utensil fails to adhere to the surface of the foamed polyurethane. Cream time (CT), gel time (GT) and tack-free time (TFT) are determined only for foamed polyurethane compositions prepared in open mold samples. Gel time and tack free time are not measured for closed-mold samples since the contents of the closed mold are not accessible at the relevant times. Cream time is typically measured during or just after the precursor mixing stage and prior to mold filling and is recorded for all closed-mold experiments.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0169">Following degassing, the polyol composition is allowed to cool to just under 100&#xb0; F. prior to the addition of the surfactant, catalyst and blowing agent. The polyol composition, surfactant, catalyst and blowing agent blend is mixed mechanically taking care to avoid the introduction of air. After a mixing time of approximately 30 seconds, the polyisocyanate component is added with stirring over approximately 10 seconds to the polyol composition containing the surfactant, catalyst and blowing agent and the starting time is recorded as t=0 seconds.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0170">Compression tests are carried out according to the ASTM D1621 protocol conducted on 2 inch by 1 inch cubes cut from foamed polyurethane compositions prepared in open cups as detailed herein.

The contents of the reactor are stirred and heated to 150&#xb0; C. A second monomeric polyol, pentaerythritol, (534.00 g, 3.92 mol, 4.44%) is added to the reactor with continued stirring. The pentaerythritol substantially dissolves within a 2 minute period. The mechanical agitator shaft speed is maintained at approximately 5000 rpm which corresponds to a linear velocity of the mixing blade of approximately 100 feet per second. Bisphenol A polycarbonate powder (3200.00 g, 26.59%), LEXAN&#xae; 105 (Sabic), is then added over a 7 minute period. After 25 minutes no polycarbonate powder remains visible in the reactor. Approximately 32 minutes after the addition of the polycarbonate is initiated, diisopropanol amine (132.00 g, 0.99 mol, 1.10%) is added to the reaction mixture.
