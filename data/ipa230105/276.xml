Often, to prepare a dish, ingredients must be unpackaged by hand, measured by, hand, and combined into a cooking apparatus, such as a pan, fryer, or oven. A chef or cook then often attends to the food during the cooking process before transferring the food to a plate or serving container. In some cases, a food expeditor (expo) may add garnishes and finalize preparations before delivery to a customer by a server or cashier. The resulting food must be delivered to be served while it is still fresh.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Chinese food service industry requires a relatively large amount of manual labor to prepare food for customers. Often, preparation of Chinese food requires intensive labor, such as operating a wok, which requires constant movement or agitation of the food to cook the food evenly and avoid burning. Some parts of the Chinese food industry have seen a rise in cost of food labor due to increases in wages and benefits in many major cities along with a labor supply issue caused in part by increasing education levels of the population. Moreover, many Chinese food restaurants lack standardized processes employed by other restaurants types (hamburger chains, for example), which could help offset the rising costs of Chinese food production. A lack of standardized processes and a reliance on manual labor make scaling of Chinese food (and similar cuisine) restaurants relatively difficult.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need in the art for improved apparatus and processes for cooking food that heats the food evenly and properly, avoids burning, and readily served in dishes or placed in containers for delivery. There is a further need in the art for improved apparatus and processes for preparing Chinese food that heats it evenly and properly, avoids burning, and is readily served in dishes or placed in containers for delivery.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like numerals describe similar components in different views.

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Like many food service industries, the Chinese food service industry requires a large amount of manual labor to prepare food for customers. Often, preparation of Chinese food requires intensive labor, such as operating a wok, which requires constant movement or agitation of the food to cook the food evenly and avoid burning. Some parts of the Chinese food industry have seen a rise in cost of food labor due to increases in wages and benefits in many major cities along with a labor supply issue caused in part by increasing education levels of the population. Moreover, many Chinese food restaurants lack standardized processes employed by other restaurants types (hamburger chains, for example), which could help offset the rising costs of Chinese food production. A lack of standardized processes and a reliance on manual labor make scaling of Chinese food (and similar cuisine) restaurants relatively difficult.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This disclosure addresses these and other problems by simplifying and automating several aspects of food production, such as receiving orders, mixing ingredients, and cooking the food for each customer. In various embodiments, the methods and processes disclosed lend themselves especially well to the preparation of Chinese food. In various embodiments, an automated cooking system includes a housing and a cooking vessel, such as a pan or wok, removably connected to the housing. The cooking system can further include an induction heating device within the housing positioned near the cooking vessel, where the induction heating device can heat the cooking vessel using induction. A lid of the cooking system can be coupled to the housing and movable between a covered and an uncovered position, where the lid can cover the cooking vessel in the covered position. The cooking system can further include a radiant heater connected to the lid, where the radiant heater can transfer radiant heat toward and to the cooking vessel when the lid is in the closed position. In various embodiments, the radiant and inductive heating apparatus are used in conjunction to prepare food. In various embodiments, the radiant and inductive heating apparatus are controlled by programs which enhance the accuracy and repeatability of the food preparation. In various embodiments, the programming is dependent on the type and quantity of the food prepared.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">This system and similar systems described further herein help reduce the complexity of the food preparation process, by enabling tight control of the cooking process through the use of multiple heat types. In various embodiments, the system includes a controller configured to operate one or more of a mixer of the cooking vessel, the induction heater, the radiant heater, and a convection heater based on a cooking algorithm to cook food within the cooking vessel. The controller helps to provide consistent and/or standard cooking procedures increase food quality and consistency. In some cases, it may allow for preparation of food by an attendant who does not require the level of skill and understanding of the food being prepared, but can operate the machine to produce a high quality and delicious food for the consumer as if they had years of experience in such preparation. Further, because a majority of the cooking operations can be performed by the automated cooking system, the system can help improve safety during cooking procedures.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further variations of an automated cooking system according to the present subject matter include a convection heater located within the housing and configured to deliver hot air to the cooking vessel to provide a third type of heat to the cooking vessel and food. In various embodiments, the automated cooking system can also include a mixer positioned within the cooking vessel, where the mixer can rotate relative to the cooking vessel. The system can include a motor located within the housing and operable to drive the mixer to rotate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In these examples, the automated cooking system includes the controller configured to operate a cooking algorithm, where the cooking algorithm is configured to, depending on the ingredients within the cooking vessel, independently adjust a speed of the motor, and heat produced by each of the induction heater, the radiant heater, and the convection heater to cook the food within the vessel. The cooking algorithm can also be configured to operate the mixer in both rotational directions at various time intervals during cooking.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Because these and other features discussed herein can perform a large portion of required cooking operations, the automated cooking system reduces the amount of training required to deliver top-quality food, which can help reduce labor costs and food prices. Also, because the cooking operations performed by the automated cooking system can be tightly controlled, an amount of oil used during cooking operations can be reduced, which can help reduced waste, improve food quality, and improve healthiness over traditional flying and cooking with a wok. Further, the automated cooking process can help reduce operator (cook) exposure to open flame and hot oil during cooking operations, which can create a more enjoyable (cooler) and safer work environment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another aspect of various embodiments of this disclosure are that they provide a data-driven platform where the cooking process is integrated with a point-of-sale (POS) system, intermediate computer system, and/or marketing platform to enable real-time data analysis to guide decision making process for business, to help reduce spoilage, increase efficiency, and drastically improve customer experience by providing food that is cooked faster (fresher) without reducing quality. The controller and/or intermediate computer system can log data and analyze the data for process and algorithm improvement. The controller and/or intermediate computer system can also distribute updates to other controllers and/or intermediate computer systems to help centralize preparation procedures, improving food consistency and quality.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">This overview is intended to provide an overview of subject matter of the present patent application.

The third automated cooker <b>1210</b> can then perform the cooking operation C, chicken with broccoli, #8.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">During the cooking operation A, food items <b>1212</b> can be loaded into a cooking vessel of the automated cooker <b>1206</b> (such as the cooking vessel <b>104</b>) and the automated cooker <b>1206</b> can perform heating and mixing operations to cook the food items to complete the order. During loading of the food items <b>1212</b> into the cooking vessel, each of the food items <b>1212</b> can be scanned as they are loaded into the automated cooker <b>1206</b> at the scan sensor <b>1216</b>. For example, the code <b>1214</b> of each food item <b>1212</b> can be scanned by the scan sensor <b>1216</b>, which can produce a scan signal that can be transmitted to a controller within the automated cooker <b>1206</b> and/or the intermediate system <b>1204</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The controller can receive the scan signal and can determine whether the food item <b>1202</b> is the correct food item for the cooking operation A (fried rice #6). If, for example, the food item <b>1202</b> is incorrect, the controller can produce an alert that can be transmitted to the intermediate system <b>1204</b> to alert an operator. Similarly, the controller can enable one or more indicators (such as a light or speaker) on the automated cooker <b>1206</b> to indicate to the operator that the food item <b>1202</b> is incorrect. Further, the controller can prevent cooking operations from proceeding when the food item <b>1202</b> is incorrect.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">When the food item <b>1202</b> is correct, cooking operations can proceed. When the controller determines that all of the food items <b>1202</b> have been received, heating and mixing operations of the automated cooker <b>1206</b> can begin. In some examples, as discussed in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, the controller can adjust the cooking operations based on the order and/or the food item <b>1202</b> as indicated by the scan signal received from the scan sensor <b>1216</b>. When the cooking operation is complete the automated cooker <b>1206</b> can produce an alert transmittable to the POS <b>1202</b>, the intermediate system <b>1204</b>, and/or can produce an audio or visual alert to notify an operator or user that the operation is complete. Such an alert sent to the POS can indicate that the order is ready for pick up and/or delivery.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some examples, the intermediate system <b>1204</b> can be omitted and one or more POS devices can select and monitor the first automated cookers <b>1206</b>-<b>1210</b>. In other examples, the intermediate system <b>1204</b> can update cooking and assignment algorithms that can be distributed to each of the automated cookers <b>1206</b>-<b>1210</b>. The intermediate system <b>1204</b> can also transmit updates to other controllers and/or intermediate computer systems at different locations to help centralize preparation procedures, improving food consistency and quality.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a diagram of an automated cooking system <b>1200</b>A, according to one embodiment of the present subject matter.
