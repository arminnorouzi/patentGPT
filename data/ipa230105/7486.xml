Wireless devices may be unaware of which access points are authorized and without suspecting it, may respond to a beacon. This instance can cause a serious vulnerability to an entity because the unauthorized access point may become gateway for confidential information transferred to and from unsuspecting wireless devices, allowing data theft. Operators of unauthorized access points may be not always real intruders. In one scenario, an employee adds an extra access point to an area with limited coverage, without realizing the consequences.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, the unauthorized access point is not subject to policies and procedures defined by network administrators through access points. For example, undesirable wireless devices making prohibited data transfers, such as video downloads, voice calls or chat sessions, can steal network bandwidth from other operations more critical to the entity.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, what is needed is a robust technique for securing computer networks by preventing wireless connections to an unauthorized access point using NAV values.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These shortcomings are addressed by the present disclosure of methods, computer program products, and systems for deploying idle transceivers of MIMO transceiver chains for rapid connection of Wi-Fi clients.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, MAC addresses are stored for unauthorized access points discovered on an enterprise network. Broadcasts of a probe request are detected from a wireless station with the MAC address for the unauthorized access point in order to begin association between the wireless station and the unauthorized access point.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, responsive to the probe request detection, a spoofed probe response is transmitted including a MAC address of the unauthorized access point to the station to appear as if sent by the unauthorized access point.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize many additional variations made possible by the succinct description of techniques below. For example, although Wi-Fi referred to throughout this document, the same principles can be extended to Bluetooth or hybrid wireless data communication channels as well.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Systems for Preventing Connections to Unauthorized Access Points with NAV Values (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level block diagram illustrating a system for preventing connections to unauthorized access points with NAV values, according to one embodiment. The system <b>100</b> includes an authorized access point <b>110</b>, a station <b>120</b> and a controller <b>130</b> coupled in communication. Also, there is an unauthorized access point <b>140</b>. Other embodiments of the system <b>100</b> can include additional network components that are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, there can be more access points (e.g., both authorized and unauthorized) and more stations. There can also be network devices such as switches, routers, fire walls, proxy servers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each of the components of the system <b>100</b> can operate by transmitting data packets among network devices. The data packets can include header fields and data fields. The authorized access point <b>110</b> and the controller <b>130</b> are both directly connected to the network <b>110</b>, preferably by hardwire. The station <b>120</b> is indirectly connected to the network <b>110</b> by Wi-Fi to the authorized access point <b>110</b>. Other types of data networks can be implemented, such as cellular networks (e.g., 3G, 4G, or 5G).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The authorized access point <b>110</b> can be any of the computing devices, such as a personal computer, a server blade, any computing environment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The authorized access point <b>110</b> is preferably connected to the network <b>110</b> (or to a switch, router, hub, or another access point that is connected to the network <b>110</b>) via a wired or wireless connection. The authorized access point <b>110</b> can be set-up in various configurations with other access points to provide wireless coverage areas. In one embodiment, the functionality is incorporated into a switch or router, and in another embodiment, is incorporated into a custom enclosure. In operation, the authorized access point <b>110</b> transmits network packets to and from station <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The unauthorized access point <b>140</b> can be an identical or similar device to the authorized access point <b>110</b>. The characterization as unauthorized refers to whether or not access points have permission to join a network or to communicate with a particular station. For example, an employee of a company can bring a personal access point from home and connect it to the wired network backbone to provide better coverage area or strength to a local area network. Also, a data thief can set up a covert access point in a parking lot of a company. In still another example, the unauthorized access point <b>140</b> may be friendly to the network, but has not yet completed its own authentication or association in a satisfactory manner because of many reasons. Additionally, an authorized access point can be manually deauthorized by a network administrator or automatically deauthorized due to abnormal behavior (e.g., high network usage). In one embodiment, the unauthorized access point <b>140</b> has a stronger signal than the authorized access point <b>110</b> relative to one or more stations, making it the preferred connection to the backend network.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the authorized access point <b>110</b> prevents initial connections with the unauthorized access point from the station <b>120</b> using spoofed management frames during a BSS scan. The authorized access point <b>110</b> can discover the unauthorized access point <b>110</b> by scanning a beacon frame in all channels in the wireless network. A list of rogue access points can be maintained and shored through the controller. To prevent an unauthorized connection, a spoofed response to a BSS scan can include a NAV value (e.g., 32,767 microseconds) so that the medium is occupied for the highest possible time on the unauthorized access point channel and a station is unable to continue any further connection messages with the unauthorized access point <b>140</b>. Then the authorized access point <b>110</b>, as an authorized member of the wireless network, can then attempt to intervene and initiate a connection with the station <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the probe response initially includes a channel switch announcement attempting to cut off further communications to the unauthorized access point <b>140</b>. However, responsive to detecting that the unauthorized connection is unaffected, the NAV value is adjusted using a spoofed frame.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The NAV is a virtual carrier-sensing that is a logical abstraction which limits the need for physical carrier-sensing at the air interface in order to save power. The MAC layer frame headers contain a duration field that specifies the transmission time required for the frame, in which time the medium will be busy. The stations listening on the wireless medium read the Duration field and set their NAV, which is an indicator for a station on how long it must defer from accessing the medium.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The NAV may be thought of as a counter, which counts down to zero at a uniform rate. When the counter is zero, the virtual carrier-sensing indication is that the medium is idle; when nonzero, the indication is busy. The medium shall be determined to be busy when the station (STA) is transmitting. In IEEE 802.11, the NAV represents the number of microseconds the sending STA intends to hold the medium busy (maximum of 32,767 microseconds). When the sender sends a Request to Send the receiver waits one SIFS before sending Clear to Send. Then the sender will wait again one SIFS before sending all the data. Again the receiver will wait a SIFS before sending ACK. So NAV is the duration from the first SIFS to the ending of ACK. During this time the medium is considered busy.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">There are three states to describe the relationship between access points or unauthorized access points, with mobile stations: 1) unauthenticated and unassociated; 2) authenticated and unassociated; and 3) authenticated and associated. An additional level of IEEE 802.1x authentication is available. Initially both access points and mobile stations are in state 1. After selecting access points for network access, and successful completion of a challenge-response sequence (e.g., WEP shared key authentication), the components move to state 2. Finally, mobile stations associate with access points to move to state 3. Upon receiving a disassociation request, the components return to state 2, or upon receiving a de-authentication request, the components return to state 1 from either state 2 or 3. Messages cannot be exchanged in either states 1 or 2, but the components are preferably returned to state 1 in which the keys and states are deleted and both authentication and association are required to reestablish unauthorized communications.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In still other embodiments, the access point <b>110</b> can operate under the direction of the controller <b>130</b> in managing the unauthorized access points. The controller <b>130</b> is above the access point <b>110</b> in a network hierarchy, allowing the controller <b>130</b> to provide high-level management of the access point <b>110</b> and other access points in the network <b>110</b>. For example, the controller <b>130</b> can maintain a list of unauthorized BSSIDs and/or MACs and periodically check for reconnections. In another example, when an unauthorized connection with one mobile station is discovered, the controller <b>105</b> can direct other access points to check their coverage areas for the same unauthorized access point. Moreover, the controller <b>130</b> can maintain a list of overrides (e.g., not officially authorized access points) to stop the access point <b>110</b> from initiating a disconnection. Additional embodiments of the access point <b>110</b> are set forth below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The station <b>120</b> scans for SSIDs and can send probe request to access points in the vicinity of its radio frequency signal. When the station <b>120</b> receives a probe response with NAV value, transmission to the BSS discontinues until the NAV duration value reaches zero and prevents an unauthorized connection. With a connection to the unauthorized access point <b>140</b> being stymied, a connection to the authorized access point <b>110</b> is more likely. In one embodiment, the station (or mobile station, STA, client or wireless device) <b>120</b> can be, for example, a personal computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, smart phone, mobile computing device, Internet appliance, end station or any other computing device as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Station <b>120</b> is wirelessly couples to access points using a radio and antenna. No pre-configuration or client is needed. The station <b>120</b> operates according to wireless standards such as IEEE 802.11a, b, g, n, ac, w or any other wireless standard. The station <b>120</b> sends and/or receives network packets for applications being executed. Embodiments of the station <b>120</b> are discussed in more detail below in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a more detailed block diagram illustrating the (authorized) access point <b>110</b> of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to one embodiment. The access point <b>110</b> includes a rogue station module <b>210</b>, a station management module <b>220</b>, an operating system <b>230</b>, and a network connection module <b>240</b>. The components can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rogue station module <b>210</b> uses NAV maximum value to essentially tie up communications between unauthenticated access points and stations. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the rogue station module <b>210</b> further comprises a rogue station database <b>110</b> to store MAC addresses for the unauthorized access points. An unauthorized connection detector <b>320</b> detects broadcasts of a probe request from a wireless station with the MAC address for the unauthorized access point in order to begin association between the wireless station and the unauthorized access point. Spoof packet module <b>330</b>, responsive to the probe request detection, generates and transmits a spoofed probe response including a MAC address of the unauthorized access point to the station to appear as if sent by the unauthorized access point. The probe response includes a NAV element and the MAC address of the unauthorized access point, the NAV element set at a value high enough to prevent the station from transmitting to the unauthorized access point during a period. The station management module <b>220</b> can then initiate a connection with the wireless station.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The station management module <b>220</b> manages station connections by advertising beacons, receiving probe request, sending probe responses and other management frames. Further, individual stations can be tracked as to bandwidth usage, QoS, BSSID assignment, and the like. Beacons and probe responses can also be modified by the station management module <b>220</b> to include NAV field information.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The operating system <b>230</b> interfaces between the software and hardware of the access point <b>110</b>. The operating system <b>230</b> can also include integrated applications.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The network communication module <b>240</b> includes one or more transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) antennas and electronics (e.g., encoders/decoders) for communication with the physical layer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Methods for Preventing Connections to Authorized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a high-level flow diagram illustrating a method <b>400</b> for preventing connections to unauthorized access points with NAV values, according to one embodiment. The method <b>400</b> can be implemented by, for example, an authorized access point (e.g., access point <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At step <b>410</b>, unauthorized access points are stored by MAC address. Some are identified by an access point scanning an area within radio range. Other are identified earlier by a different access point and then spread by a controller to the other access points.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At step <b>420</b>, a spoofed probe response is generated and transmitted by the access point to avoid initiating connections to the client from the unauthorized access point. The probe response can include a NAV value that prevents the client from necessary communications for associating with an unauthorized access point, as described below in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the spoof probe response modifying NAV values is responsive to a failed attempt to prevent unauthorized connections using channel switch announcements, as described above.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>430</b>, a connection is initiated with station and the authorized access point.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a more detailed flow diagram illustrating the step <b>530</b> of preventing connection between the client and the unauthorized access point with a spoofed probe response using a modified NAV value, from the method <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, according to one embodiment.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step <b>510</b>, a BSSID of the unauthorized access point is determined. In one embodiment, the access point listens to beacons broadcast by access points within radio range. The beacon is then parsed to expose identifiers such as source MAC address and BSSIDs being advertised. Either of these identifiers can be used to, for example, identify BSSIDs that are not recognized as authenticated, or to compare against a list of known unauthorized access points. In another embodiment the access point sends out quiet elements in beacons or probe responses. The quiet element causes stations to stop transmission temporarily so that the channel can be monitored for other activities.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step <b>520</b>, a NAV value is configured, as described above. The NAV value can be maximized, configured to a certain value by a network administrator, or automatically determined by a process. For instance, the maximum value can be reduced until reaching a threshold value that is effective but does not take the station out of operation for so long.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>530</b>, a probe response packet is generated by an authorized access point using the unauthorized BSSID and the NAV value. The packet is falsely configured with the unauthorized BSSID as the source address so that mobile stations listening for packets will operates as if the unauthorized access point is initiating the channel switch.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Generic Computing Device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computing device <b>600</b> for use in the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to one embodiment.
