increasingly mobile, remote users access internet-and intranet-based enterprise resources by way of software-defined wide area networks (SD-WAN). Deployed as a virtual overlay to an existing network topology, a SD-WAN uses software-defined concepts for distributing traffic across a wide area network. Under the conventional SD-WAN model, a remote user may connect to the network via a centralized remote access gateway hosted by the enterprise. The location of the centralized remote access gateway is generally based on the physical location of the enterprise. However, as the number of remote users and/or the distance between remote users and the centralized gateway increases, the conventional model presents inefficiencies in, e.g., speed, connectivity, traffic allocation, bandwidth availability, and overall system management.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a system for hosting a centralized remote access gateway for remote users;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a system for dynamically generating SD-WAN mobile remote access gateways for remote users, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of system components for dynamically generating SD-WAN mobile remote access gateways for remote users, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment for a method for dynamically generating a mobile SD-WAN remote access gateway for remote users, in accordance with the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment for a method for dynamically updating remote access gateways, in accordance with the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a computer system, in accordance with the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment, a system may include one or more processors and one or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media comprising instructions that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause one or more components of the system to perform operations including, receiving location data associated with a plurality of remote users accessing one or more existing remote access gateways, wherein the one or more existing remote access gateways are located at one or more network locations; building a heatmap of user locations based at least in part on the received location data; and identifying, from the heatmap of user locations, at least one new network location in which to generate at least one new remote access gateway, or at least one existing network location from the one or more network locations in which to remove at least one existing remote access gateway from the one or more existing remote access gateways. The identifying step may further include determining, from the heatmap of user locations, a concentration of remote users at the at least one new network location, and if the concentration of the remote users at the at least one new network location exceeds a first pre-determined threshold, generating the at least one new remote access gateway at the at least one new network location. The identifying step may additionally include determining, from the heatmap of user locations, a concentration of remote users at the at least one existing network location; and if the concentration of the remote users at the at least one existing network location has fallen below a second pre-determined threshold, removing the at least one existing remote access gateway from the at least one existing network location.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the location data may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with the plurality of remote users, wherein the IP addresses are translated via a geolocation database into the user locations for the building or updating of the heatmap.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, the at least one new new network location may be identified based on traffic generated by each remote user and a distance of the remote user from the one or more existing remote access gateways.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the one or more existing remote access gateways and the at least one new remote access gateway may be connected via a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) fabric. In accordance with an embodiment, the SD-WAN may operate as a service hosted by a provider, wherein the provider may include at least one of a cloud service provider, an enterprise provider, or a hybrid cloud-enterprise provider.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another embodiment, a method may include the steps of receiving location data associated with a plurality of remote users accessing one or more existing remote access gateways, wherein the one or more existing remote access gateways are located at one or more network locations; building a heatmap of user locations based at least in part on the received location data; and identifying, from the heatmap of user locations, at least one new network location in which to generate at least one new remote access gateway, or at least one existing network location from the one or more network locations in which to remove at least one existing remote access gateway from the one or more existing remote access gateways.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to yet another embodiment, one or more computer-readable non-transitory storage media may embody instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the performance of operations including receiving location data associated with a plurality of remote users accessing one or more existing remote access gateways, wherein the one or more existing remote access gateways are located at one or more network locations; building a heatmap of user locations based at least in part on the received location data; and identifying, from the heatmap of user locations, at least one new network location in which to generate at least one new remote access gateway, or at least one existing network location from the one or more network locations in which to remove at least one existing remote access gateway from the one or more existing remote access gateways.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Technical advantages of certain embodiments of this disclosure may include one or more of the following. The systems and methods described herein may use the location data of remote users to build a dynamic heatmap indicating the network locations of the remote users across the SD-WAN. Using the heatmap, if the system identifies a network location having a concentration of remote users and/or traffic that rises above a pre-determined threshold, it may &#x201c;spin-up&#x201d; a new remote access gateway at or near the identified network location. Likewise, if the system identifies a network location having a concentration of users and/or traffic that falls below a pre-determined threshold, it may initiate the &#x201c;spinning-down&#x201d; of a remote access gateway occurring at or near the identified network location. Because the heatmap is dynamic, the concentrations of remote users and/or traffic are continuously updated on the heatmap at regular intervals of time. The dynamic nature of heatmap and the ability of the system to spin up and spin down remote access gateways based on use may result in improved user experience for both internet- and intranet-bound user traffic in the network.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other technical advantages will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an enterprise <b>110</b> located in California <b>125</b>, for example, may have remote users located in various cities around the world. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts remote users <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b> in Dallas <b>145</b>, New York <b>155</b>, and Las Vegas <b>165</b>, respectively. Additional remote users <b>170</b> may be located in other locations <b>175</b>. In order to provide remote users <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> access to internet- or intranet-based enterprise resources, the enterprise <b>110</b> may host a centralized remote access gateway <b>120</b> through which remote users <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> may connect via the internet <b>130</b>. Traditionally, these remote user connections were established though a virtual private network (VPN), wherein virtual point-to-point connections were created through dedicated circuits or tunneling protocols over existing networks. However, as an increasing amount of data and applications are stored and managed on the cloud, the SD-WAN provides a virtual interface, i.e., a virtual overlay to the physical network, to connect a series of endpoints, and in the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to connect remote users <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> to enterprise- or cloud-based resources.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Notably, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the centralized remote access gateway <b>120</b> may reside at a location corresponding to the physical or network location of the enterprise <b>110</b>, which is often distinct from the network locations of remote users <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b>. This may pose difficulties for both the remote user and the service provider. For example, when a remote mobile user connects to an SD-WAN centralized remote access gateway, he/she usually does so with a multi-band device. If the device is roaming in a remote location, it may connect in a foreign public land mobile network (PLMN) through Wi-Fi. Although local Wi-Fi access may find an attachment point that is closer to the interface, the traffic generated over the connection must first be routed to the home PLMN before it can enter a SD-WAN. Thus, a network location which may be beneficial for one interface may prove inefficient for another interface. Such inefficiencies may impact the speed, connectivity, and allocation of traffic resources within the network.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, wherein is shown a system <b>200</b> for dynamically generating SD-WAN mobile remote access gateways for remote users in a SD-WAN fabric, according the present disclosure. The system <b>200</b> includes an initial remote access gateway <b>220</b> hosted by an enterprise <b>210</b> and having a connection to the internet <b>230</b>. The initial remote access gateway <b>220</b> may be centralized and/or associated with the geographic and/or network location of the enterprise <b>210</b>. Remote users <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b> in various user network locations <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>272</b> may access enterprise resources by connecting to the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b> through the SD-WAN. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a single remote user <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b> in each of the user network locations <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>272</b>, it is to be understood that there may be one or more remote users in each of the one or more network locations who connect to the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As remote users <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b> connect to the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b>, a SD-WAN controller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) associated with the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b> may receive location data relating to each of the remote users <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b> and translate the data into corresponding user network locations <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>272</b> of the remote users. In accordance with an embodiment, the translation of location data into corresponding user network locations may be accomplished as follows. The location data of a given remote user may comprise the Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with that remote user's device. This location data, received by the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b>, may be transmitted to the SD-WAN controller. The SD-WAN controller may use any geolocation database (e.g., IPinfo, IPData, IPGeolocation, etc.) to translate the location data into the remote user's network location. Because the geolocation of an IP address is often based on the business address of the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to which the IP address has been assigned, the network location corresponding to the IP address may be different from the user's physical location.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Using the user network locations <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>272</b> of the remote users <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b>, the SD-WAN controller may then build a dynamic heatmap representing the concentrations of remote users <b>240</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>270</b> at each of the user network locations <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>262</b>, <b>272</b>. In an embodiment, concentrations may be quantitative, representing, for example, a number of remote users, a percentage of total users, an amount of traffic generated by the users, bandwidth, latency, path length, or the like. In other embodiments, concentrations may be qualitative, depicting high, medium or low concentrations of remote users relative to other network locations. In yet further embodiments, concentrations may comprise a hybrid of quantitative and qualitative factors. The heatmap may comprise a visual depiction, a numerical representation, a graphical representation, and/or any other pictorial or analytical means, tool and/or device for representing locations of users in a network.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the concentration of remote users <b>240</b> at a given network location <b>242</b>, as represented in the heatmap, reaches or surpasses a pre-specified threshold, the SD-WAN controller may generate a new remote access gateway <b>244</b> at or near the given network location <b>242</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a first new remote access gateway <b>244</b> generated in association with a user network location <b>242</b>, as well as a second new remote access gateway <b>254</b> generated in association with a separate user network location <b>252</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each new remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may be interconnected with one another and with the initial remote access gateway through an SD-WAN fabric <b>280</b>. The SD-WAN fabric may be dynamic. In other words, the SD-WAN fabric may extend (grow larger) as new remote access gateways are spun-up. Likewise, the SD-WAN fabric may contract (grow smaller) as existing remote access gateways are spun-down (as explained further below) in the system <b>200</b>. Additionally, the SD-WAN may operate as a service hosted by a provider, wherein the provider may include a cloud service provider, an enterprise provider, and/or a hybrid cloud-enterprise provider.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain embodiments, generating a new remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may involve &#x201c;spinning-up&#x201d; a remote access gateway on a virtual machine (or orchestrator) running at the associated user network location <b>242</b>, <b>252</b>. For example, an SD-WAN controller may generate a new remote access gateway by instructing the virtual machine (or orchestrator) to spin-up the new remote access gateway at a user network location. Likewise, as explained below, the SD-WAN controller may remove an existing remote access gateway by instructing the virtual machine (or orchestrator) to spin-down the existing remote access gateway at a user network location. In certain embodiments, virtual SD-WAN routers may be spawned as remote access gateways.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with the present disclosure, the heatmap may be dynamic. Thus, as the concentrations of remote users in various user network locations change, the heatmap may be updated to reflect the new concentrations. In accordance with an embodiment, the heatmap may be dynamically updated based on concentrations of remote users who have connected to the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b> or one of the new remote access gateways <b>244</b>, <b>254</b>. In other words, as remote users connect to the initial and/or new remote access gateways, the system may continue to receive location data relating to the remote users and translate the data into corresponding user network locations of the remote users. Therefore, the dynamic heatmap may be built and/or updated based on the concentrations of remote users accessing the initial remote access gateway <b>220</b>, as well as the new remote access gateways. Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may add a new remote access gateway (e.g., in network locations with a high concentration of remote users) or remove an existing remote access gateway (e.g., in network locations with a low concentration of remote users). An existing remote access gateway may generally refer to a remote access gateway that exists at the time of determining whether to add and/or remove a remote access gateway. Over the course of time, a &#x201c;new&#x201d; remote access gateway may become an &#x201c;existing&#x201d; remote access gateway, and additional (newer) remote access gateways can be generated as the remote users change network locations over time.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the building of a heatmap may refer to creating a new heatmap and/or updating an existing heatmap. Thus, when the concentration of remote users at a user network location rises above a threshold level and is maintained at or above that level for a pre-determined period of time, the SD-WAN controller may generate (e.g., may initiate the spinning-up of) a new remote access gateway at or near that user network location. Likewise, when the concentration of remote users at a network location falls below a threshold level and is maintained at or below that level for a specified period of time, the SD-WAN controller may remove (e.g., may initiate the &#x201c;spinning-down&#x201d; of) the remote access gateway at or near that user network location. The spinning-down of a particular remote access gateway may include transferring remote users from the particular remote access gateway to the initial remote access gateway or to another existing remote access gateway, and thereafter deactivating the particular remote access gateway.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each new remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may serve dual functions as: 1) a user-facing gateway <b>246</b>, <b>256</b>; and 2) a network-facing SD-WAN edge device <b>248</b>, <b>258</b>. As a user-facing gateway <b>246</b>, <b>256</b>, the new remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may serve as a point of entry for remote users to access enterprise and/or cloud resources and applications. As a network-facing edge device <b>248</b>, <b>258</b> the new remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may satisfy SD-WAN functionality by enabling connectivity between networks and endpoints, and monitoring network path performance. Each remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may include any other functionality of an edge device. For example, in some embodiments, each remote access gateway <b>244</b>, <b>254</b> may serve as a point of authentication and/or policy enforcement.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the system <b>200</b> may also support multi-tenancy (not shown), wherein one or more remote access gateways may be generated based on the user network locations of remote users associated with other enterprises, i.e., separate from enterprise <b>210</b>. The system <b>200</b> may spin-up and/or spin-down remote access gateways for remote users associated with these other enterprises in the manner generally described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The system may maintain elasticity and provide isolation functionality, whereby a remote access gateway spun-up for users of another enterprise may be precluded from interconnecting with other remote access gateways associated with enterprise <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> wherein is shown a block diagram <b>300</b> of a controller <b>310</b>, such as the SD-WAN controller described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and associated components for dynamically generating SD-WAN mobile remote access gateways for remote users. The controller <b>310</b> may be deployed on-premises or on the cloud and may be communicatively coupled to one or more of the following components: an initial remote access gateway <b>320</b>, one or more new remote access gateways <b>330</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, a geolocation database <b>340</b>, and an orchestrator <b>350</b>. Controller <b>310</b> may comprise one or more of the following: a location determination module <b>312</b>, heatmap building module <b>314</b>, location calculation module <b>316</b>, and a monitoring module <b>318</b>. In operation, the controller <b>310</b> may receive location data, such as IP addresses, associated with a plurality of remote users from the initial remote access gateway <b>320</b>. Using the geolocation database <b>340</b>, the location determination module <b>312</b> of the controller <b>310</b> may determine and translate the location data received from the initial remote access gateway <b>320</b> into user network locations associated with the remote users. The heatmap module <b>314</b> may receive the translated user network locations and build (e.g., create and/or update), over a period of time, a heatmap which represents the concentrations of remote users at each of the user network locations.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the heatmap is built (e.g., created and/or updated) by the controller, the data gathered and processed therein may be transmitted to the location calculation module <b>316</b>. The location calculation module <b>316</b> may calculate and/or determine one or more new network locations to spin-up new remote access gateways by using a weighted clustering technique based on a partition clustering algorithm, which may be represented as:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Partition Algorithm Function (w[X], d, k)&#x2192;Output a k clustering of X, wherein (w[X], d) denotes weighted data based on traffic generated by each remote user at a given user network location and the distance of the remote user from the remote access gateway he/she is currently connected to. After one or more new network locations have been calculated and/or determined by the location determination module <b>312</b>, the controller <b>310</b> may instruct an orchestrator (or virtual machine) <b>350</b> to spin up one or more new remote access gateways at the determined new network locations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the controller <b>310</b> may continue to receive location data relating to remote users from the initial remote access gateway <b>320</b>, as well as from one or more of the new remote access gateways <b>330</b>. As noted above, the building of the heatmap may further comprise updating the heatmap at regular intervals to reflect changes in remote user concentrations at the various user network locations. A monitoring module <b>318</b> may continue to monitor changes in the heatmap. As the heatmap is updated by the heatmap module <b>314</b>, the changes may be transmitted to the monitoring module <b>318</b>. If the remote user concentration at a user network location falls below a pre-determined threshold and remains below that threshold for a pre-determined period of time, the monitoring module <b>318</b> may instruct the orchestrator (virtual machine) <b>350</b> to spin down a remote access gateway <b>330</b> associated with that user network location. Likewise, if the remote user concentration at a user network location rises above a pre-determined threshold and is maintained above that threshold for a pre-determined period of time, the monitoring module <b>318</b> may instruct the orchestrator (virtual machine) <b>350</b> to spin up a new remote access gateway <b>330</b> at or near the user network location. It is to be understood that the controller and associated components shown and described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be adapted or modified without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, wherein is shown an embodiment of a method <b>400</b> for dynamically hosting SD-WAN remote access gateways for remote users. The method <b>400</b> may begin at step <b>410</b>. At step <b>420</b>, an initial remote access gateway may be generated at a first network location corresponding to the geophysical or network location of an enterprise. In an embodiment, the initial remote access gateway may refer to an initial (enterprise-hosted) remote access gateway (such as depicted as element <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) or another remote access gateway that may have been generated or spun-up at a network location (such as depicted as element <b>244</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). For purposes of clarity, a network may include one or more existing remote access gateways. An existing remote access gateway may generally refer to a remote access gateway that exists at the time of determining whether to add and/or remove a remote access gateway. The existing remote access gateways may include the initial remote access gateway and any &#x201c;new&#x201d; remote access gateway(s) that have been generated such that the &#x201c;new&#x201d; remote access gateways exist at the time of determining whether to add and/or remove a remote access gateway. Additional (newer) remote access gateways may be generated over the course of time. At step <b>430</b>, location data associated with a plurality of remote users accessing the initial, new, or existing remote access gateway may be received. At step <b>440</b>, the location data may be translated into user network locations via a geolocation database. At step <b>450</b>, a heatmap of user network locations may be built (e.g., created and/or updated) based on concentrations of remote users at the user network locations. The building of the heatmap at step <b>450</b> may further comprise the updating of the heatmap at regular intervals to reflect changes in the concentrations of remote users at the various user network locations. At step <b>460</b>, a determination may be made, based on the heatmap, as to whether the concentration of users at one or more user network locations has achieved or exceeded a threshold concentration for a pre-determined period of time.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If, at step <b>460</b>, it is determined that the concentration of users at one or more user network locations has not achieved or exceeded a pre-determined threshold concentration for a pre-determined period of time, the method may return to step <b>430</b>, wherein location data associated with remote users may continue to be received. If, at step <b>460</b>, it is determined that the concentration of users at one or more user network locations has achieved or exceeded a pre-determined threshold concentration for a pre-determined period of time, the method may continue to step <b>470</b>, wherein one or more new network locations (corresponding to a location at or near the one or more user network locations achieving the pre-determined threshold concentration) may be identified for the generation of one or more new remote access gateways. At step, <b>480</b>, the one or more new remote access gateways may be generated at the one or more new network locations.

The building of the heatmap may include the updating of the heatmap at pre-determined intervals of time based on changes in concentrations of remote users at the user network locations. For example, the heatmap may be updated at 5 minute intervals, 15 minute intervals, 30 minute intervals, or other suitable time intervals. At step <b>530</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the concentration of remote users at one or more user network locations has fallen below a pre-determined threshold level for a pre-determined period of time. If, at step <b>530</b>, it has been determined that the concentration of remote users at one or more user network locations has fallen below the pre-determined threshold level for a pre-determined period of time, the method may proceed to step <b>540</b>, wherein remote users may be moved from the one or more remote access gateways at the identified one or more user network locations to one or more existing remote access gateways. At step <b>550</b>, the one or more remote access gateways having the low concentration of users may be spun down. At step <b>560</b>, the method may end.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If, at step <b>530</b>, it has been determined that the concentration of remote users at one or more user network locations has not fallen below a pre-determined threshold level for a pre-determined period of time, the method may proceed to step <b>570</b>, wherein a determination may be made as to whether the concentration of remote users at one or more network locations has exceeded a pre-determined threshold level for a pre-determined period of time. If, at step <b>570</b>, it is determined that the concentration of remote users at one or more network locations has not exceeded a pre-determined threshold level for a pre-determined period of time, the method may return to step <b>520</b>, wherein the heatmap may continue to be built (e.g., updated) at pre-determined intervals. As described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the heatmap may be built based on location data received from remote users, which is translated into user network locations of the remote users.
