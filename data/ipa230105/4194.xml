The SAR refers to the amount of electromagnetic wave energy absorbed per unit time in the unit mass of a human body.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, in North America (US, Canada) or Korea, the SAR for local exposure of a human body is regulated to be less than or equal to 1.6 W/kg for the average of 1 g of living tissue. In Europe, Ocean countries, Japan, or the like, the SAR is specified to be less than or equal to 2.0 W/kg for the average of 10 g of living tissue.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, an electronic device that performs input and output by a touch panel or the like such as a tablet PC tends to have a shorter distance from a human body at the time of use than an electronic device that performs input and output by a keyboard or the like such as a laptop PC. For this reason, particularly in the tablet PC, it is required to reduce the output of the wireless communication module in order to satisfy the SAR regulation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the electronic device described in PTL 1 uses a proximity sensor to reduce the output of the wireless communication module when the human body and the electronic device are closer than a predetermined distance, thereby satisfying the SAR regulation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, in the case of using the proximity sensor, the output of the wireless communication module is set as low output when the output of the wireless communication module need not be controlled due to erroneous detection or the like, which is problematic in terms of effective control of the output of the wireless communication module.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">There has also been studied a method of arranging a plurality of antennas in an electronic device and determining an antenna to be stopped from being used in accordance with the use situation of the electronic device, such as a display direction, a holding direction, or an installation situation. In this case, since a plurality of antennas are mounted on the electronic device, there is a problem that the manufacturing cost increases. In addition, since an unused antenna is generated in accordance with the use situation of the electronic device, there is a problem that space for arranging a plurality of antennas is required in the electronic device to make miniaturization difficult.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, in order to satisfy the SAR regulation, the inventor of the present invention has devised an electronic device configured to efficiently control the output of the wireless communication module and has reached the following invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An electronic device according to the present disclosure includes: one or more wireless communication modules that transmit and receive radio waves to and from an external device;
