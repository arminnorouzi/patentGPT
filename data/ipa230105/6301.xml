For example, when thermal runaway of a lithium ion battery occurs, a discharge valve opens and ejects an exhaust gas vigorously for several seconds. The exhaust gas has an extremely high temperature exceeding 700&#xb0; C., and is ejected into an outer case to induce thermal runaway of another battery cell. That is, the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred causes another battery cell to catch fire.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, thermal energy is significantly increased to cause expansion of a thermal failure. Battery packs having various structures have been developed in order to prevent the induction of the thermal runaway (see PTL 1).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in a schematic cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in the battery pack having this structure, tubular body <b>102</b> into which cylindrical battery <b>101</b> is inserted is coupled to thermal conduction plates <b>103</b>. Thermal energy of cylindrical battery <b>101</b> that has reached a high temperature due to thermal runaway is transferred to thermal conduction plates <b>103</b> to be absorbed. Thermal conduction plates <b>103</b> are arranged apart from each other in a two-layer structure. Adjacent tubular bodies <b>102</b> into which cylindrical battery <b>101</b> is inserted are coupled to separate thermal conduction plates <b>103</b>, and thus, the thermal energy of adjacent cylindrical batteries <b>101</b> is absorbed by separate thermal conduction plates <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The battery pack having this structure may prevent thermal runaway from being induced in the adjacent battery cell, but cannot prevent thermal runaway of the battery cell positioned at a position away from the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred. This is because this configuration may prevents the thermal energy of the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred from being thermally conducted to the adjacent battery cell, but cannot prevent the induction of the thermal runaway by the exhaust gas ejected from the battery cell in which thermal expansion has occurred. In the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred, the discharge valve opens, and instantaneously ejects the exhaust gas at the extremely high temperature vigorously. The high-temperature exhaust gas may flow inside along an inner surface of the outer case, and may overheat the battery cell at a distant position to cause thermal runaway. The exhaust gas melts an insulator insulating an end-surface electrode of the battery cell, and thus, the thermal runaway is induced in the battery cell at the distant position. In the battery cell, one end-surface electrode is insulated and is fixed to a battery case and the end-surface electrode is insulated from the battery case serving as the other electrode. When the insulator is melted, the end-surface electrode insulated from the battery case is short-circuited to the battery case, allowing an excessive short-circuit current to flow. The excessive short-circuit current causes thermal runaway by heating the battery cell with Joule heat.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2018-045919</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been developed in order to solve the above defects.

Each battery cell includes a discharge valve and an end-surface electrode. The discharge valve is provided on an end surface of the battery cell. The end-surface electrode is provided at an end portion of the battery cell and arranged on a same plane. A lead plate having a welding surface is connected to the end-surface electrode arranged on the same plane. The battery pack further includes a backflow-restricting layer disposed in the outer case. The backflow-restricting layer is disposed on a non-welding surface of the lead plate. The lead plate has a gas permeation gap therein allowing an exhaust gas discharged from the discharge valve to pass through the gas permeation gap in a discharge direction of the backflow-restricting layer from the battery cell. The backflow-restricting layer includes a resistance part configured to allow the exhaust gas passing through the gas permeation gap to pass in the discharge direction, and to suppress or prevent the exhaust gas from passing in a direction opposite to the discharge direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above battery pack prevents a catching fire of another battery cell housed in the outer case due to the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred, thus having an advantage ensuring excellent safety. Particularly, in the above battery pack, the backflow-restricting layer is disposed on the surface of the lead plate having the gas permeation gap. In the backflow-restricting layer, the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas ejected from the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred passes through the gas permeation gap of the lead plate in the discharge direction is discharged to the inside of the outer case, and is diffused on the inner surface of the outer case to reduce energy. The resistance part prevents the exhaust gas diffused on the inner surface of the outer case and attenuated in energy from flowing in the opposite direction toward another battery cell, and further reduces the energy. As a result, another battery cell is prevented from being overheated to a high temperature by the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas ejected from the battery cell in which the thermal runaway has occurred. Thus, the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas does not melt and short-circuit an insulator that insulates the positive and negative electrode terminals. The battery pack effectively prevents an adverse effect that the battery cell itself is short-circuited, an excessive short-circuit current flows, and thermal runaway occurs. Accordingly, the above battery pack has an advantage that, even when thermal runaway occurs in a particular battery cell, thermal runaway is prevented from being induced in another battery cell, thus securing high safety.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a battery pack according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the battery assembly further includes a battery holder allowing the plurality of battery cells to be arranged in fixed positions. The battery holder includes a surface plate allowing the lead plate to be disposed at a fixed position. The surface plate has an electrode window therein that exposes, through the electrode window, the end-surface electrode of the each of the plurality of battery cells disposed in the fixed positions. The lead plate is connected to the end-surface electrode of the each of the plurality of battery cells in the electrode window.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above battery pack, the lead plate may be disposed at the fixed position of the surface plate of the battery holder and the backflow-restricting layer may be placed on the lead plate. Therefore, the exhaust gas ejected from the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred is prevented from passing between the lead plate and the battery cell and flowing toward the adjacent battery cell, thus having an advantage preventing the catching fire of the adjacent battery cell.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a battery pack according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the lead plate disposed at the fixed position of the surface plate has plural gas permeation gaps therein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above battery pack, the gas permeation gaps provided in the lead plate causes the exhaust gas passing through the specific gas permeation gap due to thermal runaway to be dispersed in the gas permeation gaps. Accordingly, the energy of the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas is more effectively reduced, thus providing an advantage suppressing the catching fire of another battery cell more reliably.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a battery pack according to a fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer has a through-hole through which the exhaust gas passes, and a resistance part closing a position facing the gas permeation gap around the through-hole.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above battery pack, the through-hole is formed in the backflow-restricting layer, and the resistance part is provided to close the position facing the gas permeation gap around the through-hole. This configuration prevents the exhaust gas flowing in the opposite direction from directly passing through the gas permeation gap. The exhaust gas flowing in the opposite direction through the through-hole passes through the gas permeation gap while the exhaust gas collides with the surface of the lead plate to reduce energy without directly flowing into the gas permeation gap. This provides an advantage preventing the catching fire of the battery cell effectively. The exhaust gas discharged from the battery cell in which thermal runaway has occurred may pass through the through-hole of the backflow-restricting layer and smoothly flow into between the backflow-restricting layer and the outer case. This configuration provides an advantage suppressing the catching fire of the adjacent battery cell effectively by preventing the pressure of the exhaust gas from increasing on the inner surface of the backflow-restricting layer and leaking from the gap toward the adjacent battery cell.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a battery pack according to a fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the gas permeation gap of the lead plate is a slit opening having an annular shape. The through-hole of the backflow-restricting layer opens and faces an inside of the slit to constitute the resistance part.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The above battery pack has an advantage that the exhaust gas that has passed through the through-hole in the opposite direction can be dispersed and flown into the annular slit opening and the exhaust gas can be prevented from directly flowing into the inner surface of the lead plate to induce thermal runaway of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a battery pack according to a sixth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer has a cutout therein extended radially from the through-hole.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above battery pack has an advantage that the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas in which thermal runaway has occurred can more smoothly pass in the discharge direction and smoothly flow into the inside of the outer case. His configuration provides an advantage that the catching fire of the adjacent battery cell can be effectively suppressed by preventing the pressure of the exhaust gas from increasing on the inner surface of the backflow-restricting layer and leaking from the gap toward the adjacent battery cell. The reason why the exhaust gas smoothly flows into the inner surface of the outer case is that the cutout expands the through-hole of the backflow-restricting layer to allow the exhaust gas to smoothly pass through the through-hole.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a battery pack according to a seventh exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer has a cutout therein extended radially, the cutout allowing the exhaust gas to pass through the cutout. The cutout has a resistance part closing a position facing the gas permeation gap.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above battery pack, the backflow-restricting layer has the radially extended cutout, and the cutout is deformed by the high-temperature exhaust gas ejected from the battery cell, and the exhaust gas can be discharged. This cutout suppresses the passage of the exhaust gas flowing in the opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a battery pack according to an eighth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer is made of rubber material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above battery pack, the backflow-restricting layer made of the rubber material allows the exhaust gas ejected from the exhaust gas in which thermal runaway has occurred to burn out a part of the backflow-restricting layer. Thus, the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas may more smoothly flow into the inside of the outer case.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a battery pack according to a ninth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer is made of foamed material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The above battery pack including the backflow-restricting layer made of the foamed material provides an advantage that the exhaust gas ejected from the exhaust gas due to thermal runaway quickly burns off a part of the backflow-restricting layer, thereby allowing the high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gas to more smoothly flow into the inside of the outer case. The reason why the backflow-restricting layer made of the foamed material can quickly burn off the region where the exhaust gas is ejected is that a heat capacity of the backflow-restricting layer with respect to a volume is small and the backflow-restricting layer can burn off with less thermal energy.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a battery pack according to a tenth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the battery cell has a protrusion electrode on an end surface thereof. The discharge valve has an exhaust port opening at an outer periphery of the protrusion electrode.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a battery pack of an eleventh exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the battery cell is a cylindrical battery.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a battery pack according to a twelfth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the lead plate includes a plate part having a flat shape and constituting the non-welding surface, and an electrode connecting tongue connected to the end-surface electrode of the battery cell. The electrode connecting tongue constitutes the welding surface. The lead plate having a slit opening provided therein along an outer periphery of the electrode connecting tongue, the slit opening constituting the gas permeation gap.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a battery pack according to a thirteenth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the backflow-restricting layer is bonded to a surface of the lead plate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the drawings.

Backflow-restricting layer <b>5</b> closely contacting the surfaces of lead plates <b>3</b> via the bonding layers preferably has a non-bonding region that is not bonded to lead plate <b>3</b> having a potential difference from another lead plate in order to maintain a large insulation resistance between lead plates <b>3</b> having a potential difference. This is because when lead plate <b>3</b> having a potential difference is coupled by backflow-restricting layer <b>5</b> via the bonding layer, the insulation resistance decreases due to moisture absorbed by backflow-restricting layer <b>5</b>. In particular, since backflow-restricting layer <b>5</b> having fine voids like a foam absorbs moisture and the electric resistance tends to decrease, it is particularly effective to provide the non-bonding region at a boundary of lead plate <b>3</b> having a potential difference to increase the insulation resistance.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A battery pack according to the present invention is suitably useable as a rechargeable battery pack for devices, such as an assist bicycle, an electric motorcycle, an electric wheelchair, an electric cart, a cleaner, and an electric tool, driven by a battery.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">REFERENCE MARKS IN THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><b>100</b>: battery pack</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><b>1</b>: battery cell</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><b>1</b><i>a, </i><b>1</b><i>b: </i>end-surface electrode</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><b>2</b>: battery holder</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B: holder unit</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><b>3</b>: lead plate</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><b>3</b>A: non-welding surface</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><b>3</b>B: welding surface</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><b>4</b>: outer case</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><b>5</b>: backflow-restricting layer</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><b>6</b>: circuit board</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><b>7</b>: resistance part</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><b>10</b>: battery assembly</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><b>21</b>: surface plate</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><b>22</b>: holding part</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><b>23</b>: battery housing</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><b>24</b>: electrode window</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><b>25</b>: recess</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><b>26</b>: positioning recess</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><b>27</b>: insulating rib</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><b>28</b>: housing space</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><b>29</b>: connection window</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><b>30</b>: plate-shaped part</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><b>31</b>: electrode connecting tongue</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><b>32</b>: coupling part</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><b>33</b>: gas permeation gap</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><b>33</b>A: slit opening</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><b>35</b>: connection part</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><b>51</b>: through-hole</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><b>52</b>: cutout</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><b>101</b>: cylindrical battery</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><b>102</b>: tubular body</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><b>103</b>: thermal conduction plate</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
