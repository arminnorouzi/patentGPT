In addition, the present invention refers to the use of this multilayer film for soft packaging applications, for medical applications and for pharmaceutical applications.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For packaging applications nowadays high standards are required and quite often properties which are conflicting are needed. In industry, often multilayer films with different materials providing different functions are produced. Polypropylenes are widely used in film making for packaging materials and show good sealing properties and. However, the overall performance of such polypropylene-based multilayer films especially in view of the sealing behavior is inferior compared to polyethylene multilayer systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of multilayer films for packaging applications is known in the art. EP 1 802 464 A1 relates to an article of commerce including a disposable cleaning article and a package. The package is formed as a multilayer packaging film including at least a co-extruded vapor barrier film layer and a polymeric film layer having a melting point of at least about 20&#xb0; C. less than the co-extruded film layer laminated to the co-extruded film layer. The polymeric film layer is sealable to form the package in order to enclose the disposable cleaning article, thereby to substantially retain the water content of the disposable cleaning article.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">US 2005/238874 A1 relates to multilayer films that are suitable for packaging. A soft polymer is blended in a core layer and a tie layer comprises the soft polymer and, optionally, another polymer. A sealable layer is provided on the side of the tie layer opposite to the core layer. The multilayer film may be transparent, contain a cavitating agent, or may be pigmented to form an opaque film. The multilayer film may also be metallized or coated with a barrier coating, but will be non-transparent in any case, limiting the application range.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2010/117148 A2 refers to a multilayer medical film, and to the use thereof, and more particularly, to a multilayer medical film comprising: an outer layer comprising one type of polypropylene polymer selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, a polypropylene copolymer, and the combination thereof; an intermediate layer comprising 10 to 60 wt.-% of one type of polypropylene polymer selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, a polypropylene copolymer, and the combination thereof, and 40 to 90 wt.-% of a thermoplastic elastomer; and an inner layer comprising 60 to 80 wt.-% of one type of polypropylene polymer selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, a polypropylene copolymer, and the combination thereof, 10 to 30 wt.-% of polyethylene, and 1 to 10 wt.-% of a thermoplastic elastomer. The high amount of thermoplastic elastomer limits the applicability of these film constructions in terms of cost and heat resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 3 003 708 A1 relates to a biaxially oriented, multilayer polypropylene film constituted of at least one base layer and one first intermediate layer and a first sealable cover layer applied to said intermediate layer, the first intermediate layer being a soft intermediate layer and all layers of the film are substantially not containing vacuoles. The film is used for producing bag packaging. Sealing temperatures of 140&#xb0; C. are applied in the testing, which is much higher than desired.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">EP 2 831 168 A1 refers to an unoriented film comprising at least one layer of a polymer composition comprising a styrenic based elastomer and a propylene copolymer. Such modifiers elastomer limit applicability in terms of cost and heat resistance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2017/016711 A1 relates to a polypropylene composition comprising a crystalline propylene random copolymer and an amorphous propylene copolymer having improved hot-tack force and adhesion properties, to a process for the manufacture thereof, to the use thereof in the manufacture of adhesives and hot tack films and to articles comprising the polypropylene composition, as well as to a process for producing such an article. Such modifiers elastomer limit applicability in terms of cost and heat resistance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For packaging companies it is of utmost importance to reduce the sealing initiation temperature (SIT) of a packaging film. Even more in the view of a sustainable and circular approach, low sealing temperature, low hot tack temperature (HTT) and high hot tack force (HTF) are required. Lower SIT and higher HTF allows running the packaging lines faster and/or at lower temperatures, thus saving costs and energy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Starting therefrom it was an objective of the present invention to provide multilayer films having a lower SIT and HTT as well as a higher HTF than the multilayer films known from the prior art. In addition, it was the objective of the present invention to provide multilayer films having mechanical properties being at least on the same level than the materials known from the prior art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">These objects have been solved by the multilayer film according to claim <b>1</b> comprising at least two outer layers (A) and (C) and at least one core layer (B), at least one of the outer layers (A) and/or (C) comprises component a1), whereas the other outer layer comprises component a1) or a2), whereby</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">component a1) is a terpolymer of propylene, ethylene and one C4 to C10 &#x3b1;-olefin; whereby said terpolymer a1) has<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">an ethylene content in the range of 0.1 to 8.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the terpolymer a1);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">a C4 to C10 &#x3b1;-olefin content in the range of 0.1 to 16.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the terpolymer a1); and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">a melt flow rate MFR<sub>2 </sub>measured according to ISO 1133 (230&#xb0; C., 2.16 kg load) in the range of 0.5 to 12.0 g/10 min;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">component a2) is a polypropylene having a melting temperature of at least 150&#xb0; C.; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">layer (B) comprises a heterophasic propylene copolymer b), said heterophasic propylene copolymer b) comprises a matrix being a random propylene copolymer b1) and an elastomeric propylene copolymer b2) dispersed in said matrix; whereby the heterophasic propylene copolymer b) has<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">a melt flow rate MFR<sub>2 </sub>measured according to ISO 1133 (230&#xb0; C., 2.16 kg load) in the range of 0.3 to 20.0 g/10 min;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) determined according ISO 16152 (25&#xb0; C.) in the range of 16.0 to 50.0 wt.-%; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0020">a comonomer content in the range of 11.5 to 21.0 mol-%.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0021">It was surprisingly found by the inventors that by modifying the core layer in a multilayer film structure, a relevant effect on the sealing properties is obtained.

Quantitative <sup>13</sup>C{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectra were recorded in the solution-state using a Bruker Advance III 400 NMR spectrometer operating at 400.15 and 100.62 MHz for <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C respectively. All spectra were recorded using a <sup>13</sup>C optimised 10 mm extended temperature probehead at 125&#xb0; C. using nitrogen gas for all pneumatics. Approximately 200 mg of material was dissolved in 3 ml of 1,2-tetrachloroethane-d<sub>2 </sub>(TCE-d<sub>2</sub>) along with chromium-(111)-acetylacetonate (Cr(acac)<sub>3</sub>) resulting in a 65 mM solution of relaxation agent in solvent (Singh, G., Kothari, A., Gupta, V., Polymer Testing 28 5 (2009), 475). To ensure a homogenous solution, after initial sample preparation in a heat block, the NMR tube was further heated in a rotatary oven for at least 1 hour. Upon insertion into the magnet the tube was spun at 10 Hz. This setup was chosen primarily for the high resolution and quantitatively needed for accurate ethylene content quantification. Standard single-pulse excitation was employed without NOE, using an optimised tip angle, 1 s recycle delay and a bi-level WALTZ16 decoupling scheme (Zhou, Z., Kuemmerle, R., Qiu, X., Redwine, D., Cong, R., Taha, A., Baugh, D. Winniford, B., J. Mag. Reson. 187 (2007) 225; Busico, V., Carbonniere, P., Cipullo, R., Pellecchia, R., Severn, J., Talarico, G., Macromol. Rapid Commun. 2007, 28, 1128).

This approach allowed comparable referencing, even when this structural unit was not present. Characteristic signals corresponding to the incorporation of ethylene were observed (see Cheng, H.

Discussion of the Results</p><p id="p-0267" num="0260">Table 3 summarizes the tests conducted with the multilayer films according to the Inventive Examples IE1 and IE2 and the Comparative Examples CE1 to CE3. When comparing the data, it is necessary to take into account, that IE2 and all Comparative Examples contain a plastomer, whereas IE1 is free of plastomers. The skilled person is well aware that the plastomer influences the properties of the films, therefore IE2 is suited for a comparison of the properties with the films according to the Comparative Examples. However, IE1 demonstrates that films with very good sealing properties are also obtainable without the presence of a plastomer in one of the layers.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0261">From Table 3 can be gathered that the multilayer films IE1 and IE2 according to the present invention have a lower sealing initiation temperature (=SIT) than the multilayer films according to the Comparative Examples CE1 to CE3. In addition, it is possible to increase the Hot Tack Force of the multilayer films according to the present invention by addition of a plastomer (comparison of IE2 with IE1). The multilayer film according to IE2 shows a significantly higher Hot Tack Force than the multilayer films according to the Comparative Examples. Furthermore, the multilayer films according to the present invention IE1 and IE2 have a reduced Hot Tack Temperature and an increased Max. Force compared to CE1 to CE3.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0262">In addition, the multilayer films according to IE1 and IE2 show a higher Energy to Break and Energy to Maximum Force than the multilayer films according to the Comparative Examples, whereas the remaining mechanical properties are approximately at the same level.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0263">To sum it up, the sealing properties of the multilayer films according to the Inventive Examples IE1 and IE2 are much better than for the multilayer films according to Comparative Examples CE1 to CE3 and the multilayer films according to the present invention show improved mechanical properties, especially Energy to Break and Energy to Maximum Force.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230001674A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230001674A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>: A multilayer film comprising at least two outer layers (A) and (C) and at least one core layer (B), at least one of the outer layers (A) and/or (C) comprises component a1), whereas the other outer layer comprises component a1) or a2), whereby:<claim-text>component a1) is a terpolymer of propylene, ethylene and one C4 to C10 &#x3b1;-olefin;
