The high-frequency communication may provide a wider system bandwidth, and a smaller antenna size which further facilitates the deployment of massive MIMO in base station and UE. The high-frequency communication has disadvantages such as relatively high path loss, poor interference immunity, and frail link. The massive MIMO technology can provide relatively high antenna gain. Therefore, the combination of the high-frequency communication and the massive MIMO technology becomes the inexorable trend of a future 5G mobile communication system. However, the massive MIMO technology cannot resolve all problems in the high-frequency communication, for example, link fragility. When an obstacle is encountered in the high-frequency communication, a beam failure recovery mechanism can quickly switch beams, that is, switch a communication link from a poor-quality beam to a desirable beam, to avoid a radio link failure, thereby effectively improving the link robustness.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the meeting of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Radio Access Network (RAN) 1, the following conclusion about a beam failure recovery mechanism of UE is reached.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows specific steps of the beam failure recovery mechanism of UE as follows:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A Step <b>101</b>: detecting a beam failure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A Step <b>102</b>: identifying a new candidate beam;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A Step <b>103</b>: transmitting a beam failure recovery request;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A Step <b>104</b>: monitoring, by the UE, a response of next-generation node base station (gNB) to the beam failure recovery request.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It needs to be noted that the identification of a new candidate beam may be performed before or after the detection of the beam failure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the 3GPP RANI meeting, the following conclusion about the transmission of a beam failure recovery request by UE is reached:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transmission of a beam failure recovery request on a contention-free physical random access channel (PRACH) is supported.
