In each drawing, the same member is assigned the same reference number, and duplicate description may be omitted. Although the embodiments described below are intended for an ink tank mounted on an ink jet printer, the present invention can be widely applied to a liquid storage container mounted on a liquid ejection apparatus. In the present embodiment, &#x201c;integrally formed&#x201d; does not mean that a plurality of components or members is integrated by an adhesive or a fastening unit, and is used to mean manufacturing from the beginning as a single component or member by a unit such as injection molding.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a liquid storage container <b>1</b>A according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A according to the first embodiment, an upper part of the figure illustrates upward in the vertical direction when using the liquid ejection apparatus, and a lower part of the figure illustrates downward in the vertical direction when using the liquid ejection apparatus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a side cross-sectional view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B to <b>2</b>D</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating a method for manufacturing the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates a completed liquid storage container <b>1</b>A, that is, a cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The liquid storage container <b>1</b>A includes a container main body <b>2</b> capable of storing an ink, a rotation member <b>3</b> housed inside the container main body <b>2</b> to detect the amount of ink and a support member <b>4</b> rotatably supporting the rotation member <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The container main body <b>2</b> includes a frame member <b>21</b>, a first film F<b>1</b> and a second film F<b>2</b>. The frame member <b>21</b> is made of a transparent or semi-transparent translucent material. The frame member <b>21</b> is integrally formed by injection molding a synthetic resin such as polyacetal, nylon, polyethylene and polypropylene. The frame member <b>21</b> has openings on both side surfaces orthogonal to a rotation axis of the rotation member <b>3</b>. Specifically, an opening of the frame member <b>21</b> close to a first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> (described later) is a first opening <b>21</b>A, and an opening of the frame member <b>21</b> close to a second displacement regulation portion <b>43</b> (described later) is a second opening <b>21</b>B. A translucent protrusion portion <b>22</b> protruding upward is formed in a central portion of an upper side <b>21</b>C of the frame member <b>21</b>. An inside of the protrusion portion <b>22</b> is an internal space <b>26</b>, and a tip end portion <b>33</b>A of a display member <b>33</b> (described later) is movably housed in the internal space <b>26</b>. At least a portion of an outer wall of the container main body <b>2</b> may have translucency. As long as the protrusion portion <b>22</b> is made of a translucent material, other parts of the frame member <b>21</b> may be made of a non-translucent material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The container main body <b>2</b> includes a base member <b>23</b> protruding from an inner wall surface <b>21</b>D of the frame member <b>21</b>. The base member <b>23</b> is integrally formed with the frame member <b>21</b>. The base member <b>23</b> is a substantially L-shaped member fixed to one side wall and the bottom surface of the frame member <b>21</b>. The base member <b>23</b> is provided mainly for attaching the rotation member <b>3</b> via the support member <b>4</b>. The base member <b>23</b> also has a function of holding the first film F<b>1</b> and a function of reinforcing the frame member <b>21</b> and increasing the rigidity of the frame member <b>21</b>. The shape and position of the base member <b>23</b> are not limited, and it is desirable that the base member <b>23</b> is fixed to the frame member <b>21</b> at a plurality of positions of the inner wall surface <b>21</b>D (two sides of the frame member <b>21</b> adjacent to each other in the present embodiment). As a result, the rigidity of the frame member <b>21</b> is increased. The container main body <b>2</b> has a plurality of ribs <b>24</b>. The rib <b>24</b> has a non-linear cross section to ensure rigidity. A portion of ribs <b>24</b> are fixed to the inner wall surface <b>21</b>D of the frame member <b>21</b> and are integrally formed with the frame member <b>21</b>. A portion of ribs <b>24</b> are fixed to the base member <b>23</b> and are integrally formed with the base member <b>23</b>. That is, the frame member <b>21</b>, the base member <b>23</b> and the rib <b>24</b> are integrally formed by injection molding. The rib <b>24</b> reinforces the frame member <b>21</b>, increases the rigidity of the frame member <b>21</b>, and also has a function of holding the first and second films F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>. A portion or all of the rib <b>24</b> may be omitted. As a result, in addition to reducing the cost of the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A, the amount of ink stored is increased. A first protrusion <b>25</b> is formed on the surface of the base member <b>23</b> facing the rotation member <b>3</b>. A gap G<b>1</b> is provided between the tip end portion <b>25</b>A of the first protrusion <b>25</b> and a central connection portion <b>31</b> (described later) of the rotation member <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first film F<b>1</b> and the second film F<b>2</b> are made of a transparent resin. The first film F<b>1</b> is welded to a peripheral edge portion of the first opening <b>21</b>A of the frame member <b>21</b> by a heat welding method to cover the first opening <b>21</b>A of the frame member <b>21</b>. The second film F<b>2</b> is welded to a peripheral edge portion of the second opening <b>21</b>B of the frame member <b>21</b> by a heat welding method to cover the second opening <b>21</b>B of the frame member <b>21</b>. A space surrounded by the frame member <b>21</b> and the first and second films F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> forms an ink storage chamber <b>27</b> in which the ink is stored. The first film F<b>1</b> is also bonded to the base member <b>23</b> and the ribs <b>24</b> (excluding the ribs <b>24</b> bonded to the base member <b>23</b>), and the second film F<b>2</b> is also bonded to all the ribs <b>24</b>. As a result, the first and second films F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> are held at many parts, a bonding area is increased and the reliability of the container main body <b>2</b> is enhanced. Instead of providing the first and second films F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, the container main body <b>2</b> may be formed as a rectangular parallelepiped container, and the ink storage chamber <b>27</b> may be formed therein. An ink supply port <b>28</b> for supplying the ink to a liquid ejection head is provided in the lower portion of the ink storage chamber <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rotation member <b>3</b> is a member for detecting the amount of ink stored in the ink storage chamber <b>27</b>. A rotation member <b>3</b> includes a central connection portion <b>31</b> having a rotation center C, a float <b>32</b> connected to the central connection portion <b>31</b> and a display member <b>33</b> connected to the central connection portion <b>31</b>. The display member <b>33</b> extends substantially upward in the vertical direction from the rotation center C of the rotation member <b>3</b>, and the float <b>32</b> extends downward from the display member <b>33</b>, substantially horizontally in the present embodiment, from the rotation center C. Therefore, a rotational moment received by the rotation member <b>3</b> is mainly determined by the weight of the float <b>32</b> and the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b>. Since the display member <b>33</b> hardly contributes to the rotational moment of the rotation member <b>3</b>, the degree of freedom in the material and shape of the display member <b>33</b> is high.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The central connection portion <b>31</b> is a substantially circular plate-shaped member, and a hole is provided in the central portion, that is, at a position serving as the rotation center C of the rotation member <b>3</b>. The hole is a through-hole <b>34</b> penetrating the central connection portion <b>31</b>, and functions as a bearing for the rotation member <b>3</b>. A second protrusion <b>35</b> is formed on a surface of the peripheral edge portion of the central connection portion <b>31</b> facing the second film F<b>2</b>. A gap G<b>2</b> is provided between the tip end portion <b>35</b>A of the second protrusion <b>35</b> and the second film F<b>2</b>. The float <b>32</b> is an arm-shaped member that is supported by the central connection portion <b>31</b> and extends in the radial direction from the central connection portion <b>31</b>. The float <b>32</b> is made of a hollow resin, and the average specific gravity including the internal space is smaller than the specific gravity of the ink. Therefore, the float <b>32</b> rotates due to fluctuations in the liquid level of the ink. Instead of the hollow-structured float <b>32</b>, a solid-structured float <b>32</b> made of a material having a specific gravity smaller than that of the ink may be used. In this case, the float <b>32</b> can be integrally formed with the central connection portion <b>31</b> and the display member <b>33</b>. The display member <b>33</b> is an arm-shaped member extending in the radial direction from the central connection portion <b>31</b>, and is a member capable of displaying the position of the float <b>32</b> to the outside. The display member <b>33</b> is movably housed in the internal space <b>26</b> of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>, and the internal space <b>26</b> of the protrusion portion <b>22</b> can be rotated in conjunction with the float <b>32</b> via the central connection portion <b>31</b>. As a result, the display member <b>33</b> can indirectly display the position of the float <b>32</b> to the outside through a translucent outer wall <b>22</b>A of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>, and can display a remaining amount of ink in the ink storage chamber <b>27</b>. The tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is formed wider than other parts of the display member <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The support member <b>4</b> includes a pin <b>41</b> inserted into the through-hole <b>34</b>, and first and second displacement regulation portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> provided on both sides of the pin <b>41</b> in the axial direction. The support member <b>4</b> is made of synthetic resin. The pin <b>41</b> rotatably supports the rotation member <b>3</b>. The first and second displacement regulation portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> have outer diameters larger than the inner diameter of the through-hole <b>34</b>, and have a shape that cannot be inserted into the through-hole <b>34</b>. As a result, the first and second displacement regulation portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> regulate the displacement of the rotation member <b>3</b> in the rotation axis direction. The first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> and the pin <b>41</b> are integrally formed with the frame member <b>21</b> and the base member <b>23</b> by injection molding. The second displacement regulation portion <b>43</b> is formed by plastically deforming a tip end portion <b>41</b>A of the pin <b>41</b>, as will be described later.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, an operation of the rotation member <b>3</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. A liquid level L of the ink is located above the ink storage chamber <b>27</b>. Due to the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b>, the rotation member <b>3</b> receives a counterclockwise rotational moment M<b>1</b>. Since the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is in the internal space <b>26</b> of the protrusion portion <b>22</b> of the frame member <b>21</b>, the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> abuts on an inner wall surface <b>22</b>B on the left side of the protrusion portion <b>22</b> to prevent the rotation member <b>3</b> from rotating further counterclockwise. That is, the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is located at the left end of the internal space <b>26</b> of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>. A light emitting portion <b>6</b>A and a light receiving portion <b>6</b>B of the sensor are provided on both sides in the direction orthogonal to the paper surface sandwiching the protrusion portion <b>22</b>, that is, on the front and rear sides of the paper surface in the region surrounded by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. When the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is in the position illustrated in the drawing, the light emitted from the light emitting portion <b>6</b>A is not received by the light receiving portion <b>6</b>B. As a result, it is detected that the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is in the region surrounded by the dotted line, and it is determined that the remaining amount of ink is a predetermined amount or more.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the ink is consumed and the liquid level L of the ink is lowered to a predetermined position, the upper portion of the float <b>32</b> is exposed from the ink, and the exposed portion of the float <b>32</b> is not subjected to buoyancy. The counterclockwise rotational moment M<b>1</b> due to the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b> and a clockwise rotational moment M<b>2</b> due to the weight of the float <b>32</b> coincide with each other, and the force that presses the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> against the inner wall surface <b>22</b>B on the left side of the protrusion portion <b>22</b> is lost. When the liquid level L of the ink is further lowered, the clockwise rotational moment M<b>2</b> due to the weight of the float <b>32</b> exceeds the counterclockwise rotational moment M<b>1</b> due to the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b>, and the rotation member <b>3</b> rotates clockwise. As a result, the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b> is restored, and the counterclockwise rotational moment M<b>1</b> and the clockwise rotational moment M<b>2</b> coincide with each other. At this time, the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is located between the inner wall surface <b>22</b>B on the left side and an inner wall surface <b>22</b>C on the right side of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>, that is, at a position separated from both inner wall surfaces <b>22</b>B and <b>22</b>C. When the ink is further consumed, the rotation member <b>3</b> rotates clockwise again, and finally the lower end of the float <b>32</b> abuts on the bottom surface of the ink storage chamber <b>27</b> as illustrated by the broken line. The rotation member <b>3</b> is prevented from rotating further clockwise, and the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> stops at a predetermined position between the inner wall surface <b>22</b>B on the left side and the inner wall surface <b>22</b>C on the right side of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>. The light emitted from the light emitting portion <b>6</b>A is received by the light receiving portion <b>6</b>B, and the sensor detects that the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> is on the right side of the internal space <b>26</b> of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>. As a result, the remaining amount of ink is substantially zero, and it is determined that the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A has reached the replacement time. In order to improve the detection accuracy of the position of the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b>, when the lower end of the float <b>32</b> abuts on the bottom surface of the ink storage chamber <b>27</b>, it is desirable that the tip end portion <b>33</b>A of the display member <b>33</b> reaches the vicinity of the inner wall surface <b>22</b>C on the right side of the protrusion portion <b>22</b>. In the above description, only the buoyancy received by the float <b>32</b> and the weight of the float <b>32</b> are focused on, and in reality, the buoyancy received by the display member <b>33</b> and the rotational moment due to the weight of the display member <b>33</b> are also taken into consideration. However, as described above, these are not the dominant factors.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inner diameter of the through-hole <b>34</b> of the rotation member <b>3</b> is larger than the outer diameter of the pin <b>41</b> so that the rotation member <b>3</b> smoothly rotates around the pin <b>41</b>. Therefore, the rotation axis of the rotation member <b>3</b> may be inclined with respect to a central axis of the pin <b>41</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, when the rotation member <b>3</b> rotates clockwise R<b>1</b> and falls to the side of the first film F<b>1</b>, the through-hole <b>34</b> of the rotation member <b>3</b> may obliquely come into contact with the pin <b>41</b>, and the smooth rotation of the rotation member <b>3</b> may be impaired. However, in a case where the rotation member <b>3</b> falls to the side of the first film F<b>1</b>, the central connection portion <b>31</b> abuts on the first protrusion <b>25</b>, and the rotation member <b>3</b> is prevented from rotating further clockwise. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, in a case where the rotation member <b>3</b> rotates counterclockwise R<b>2</b> and falls to the side of the second film F<b>2</b>, the second film F<b>2</b> abuts on the second protrusion <b>35</b> to prevent the rotation member <b>3</b> from rotating further counterclockwise. On the other hand, gaps G<b>1</b> and G<b>2</b> are provided between the tip end portion <b>25</b>A of the first protrusion <b>25</b> and the central connection portion <b>31</b>, and between the tip end portion <b>35</b>A of the second protrusion <b>35</b> and the second film F<b>2</b>. Therefore, normally, the rotation member <b>3</b> does not come into contact with one of the first protrusion <b>25</b> and the second film F<b>2</b>. With the above configuration, the rotation member <b>3</b> can smoothly rotate around the pin <b>41</b>. Although not illustrated, the first protrusion <b>25</b> may be formed on the surface of the central connection portion <b>31</b> facing the base member <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, a method for manufacturing the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B to <b>2</b>D</figref>. First, the frame member <b>21</b>, the base member <b>23</b>, the rib <b>24</b>, the first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> and the pin <b>41</b> are integrally formed by injection molding. Separately from this, the rotation member <b>3</b> is prepared. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the pin <b>41</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>34</b> of the central connection portion <b>31</b> of the rotation member <b>3</b>. The tip end portion <b>41</b>A of the pin <b>41</b> is exposed to the outside of the through-hole <b>34</b>. Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the exposed tip end portion <b>41</b>A is plastically deformed by heat or pressure using a jig (not illustrated). The exposed tip end portion <b>41</b>A is compressed in the axial direction and expanded in the radial direction. Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the tip end portion <b>41</b>A of the pin <b>41</b> is pushed to a predetermined position, and further expanded in the radial direction to form a second displacement regulation portion <b>43</b>. As a result, the displacement regulation portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> that regulate the displacement of the rotation member <b>3</b> in the rotation axis direction are formed on both sides of the pin <b>41</b> in the axial direction. Thereafter, the first film F<b>1</b> and the second film F<b>2</b> are bonded to both side edge portions of the frame member <b>21</b>, and the ink storage chamber <b>27</b> is filled with the ink.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the present embodiment, the frame member <b>21</b>, the base member <b>23</b>, the rib <b>24</b>, the first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> and the pin <b>41</b> are integrally formed, and the second displacement regulation portion <b>43</b> is formed by deforming the tip end portion <b>41</b>A of the pin <b>41</b>. That is, the frame member <b>21</b>, the base member <b>23</b>, the rib <b>24</b>, the first and second displacement regulation portions <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> and the pin <b>41</b> are integrally formed (these are referred to as a frame assembly <b>7</b>). The liquid storage container <b>1</b>A can be prepared with only four members such as the frame assembly <b>7</b>, the rotation member <b>3</b> and the first and second films F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to provide the liquid storage container <b>1</b>A in which the number of components is reduced. Moreover, since the frame assembly <b>7</b> can be prepared by injection molding of synthetic resin, it can be prepared inexpensively and in a short time.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, a liquid storage container <b>1</b>B of a second embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D</figref> are the same views as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrating the first embodiment.

For the configuration and effect for which the description is omitted, refer to the description of the first embodiment. The first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> has a shape that cannot be inserted into the through-hole <b>34</b>, and is integrally formed with the pin <b>41</b>. The second displacement regulation portion is provided as a fixing block <b>5</b> provided with a hole <b>54</b> for receiving the end portion of the pin <b>41</b>.

The fixing block <b>5</b> is fixed to the base member <b>23</b> by bonding the leg portion <b>53</b> to the base member <b>23</b>. The leg portions <b>53</b> are installed so as to avoid the moving range of the float <b>32</b>.

In the present embodiment, the number of components is increased as compared with the first embodiment, and since one end of the pin <b>41</b> is supported by the fixing block <b>5</b>, the operation of the rotation member <b>3</b> is smoother. The hole <b>54</b> may be omitted so that the pin <b>41</b> abuts on the surface of the fixing block <b>5</b>.

For the configuration and effect for which the description is omitted, refer to the description of the first embodiment. The first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> is formed integrally with the pin <b>41</b>. The second displacement regulation portion <b>37</b> is provided as a portion of the rotation member <b>3</b>, specifically, the second displacement regulation portion <b>37</b> integrated with the central connection portion <b>31</b>. The central connection portion <b>31</b> is a disc-shaped member similar to that of the first embodiment. The rotation member <b>3</b> is provided with a hole <b>36</b> that terminates in the middle and receives the pin <b>41</b>. The first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> has a shape that cannot be inserted into the hole <b>36</b>. The first film F<b>1</b> is bonded to the peripheral edge portion of the frame member <b>21</b>, the base member <b>23</b> and the rib <b>24</b> as in the first embodiment, and the second film F<b>2</b> is bonded to the peripheral edge portion of the frame member <b>21</b> as in the first embodiment.

An example of the tapered shape is a conical shape, and a truncated cone, a pyramid and a pyramid cone may be used. The displacement of the pin <b>41</b> of the rotation member <b>3</b> in the axial direction is regulated by the first displacement regulation portion <b>42</b> and the second displacement regulation portion <b>37</b> of the rotation member <b>3</b>. The displacement of the pin <b>41</b> of the second displacement regulation portion <b>37</b> in the axial direction is regulated by the second film F<b>2</b>. Therefore, the rotation member <b>3</b> can rotate without being detached from the pin <b>41</b>. Since the rotation member <b>3</b> abuts on the second film F<b>2</b> at the tapered tip end portion <b>37</b>A, the rotation of the rotation member <b>3</b> is not significantly hindered. The first protrusion <b>25</b> is provided in the same manner as in the first and second embodiments, and the second protrusion <b>35</b> is unnecessary because the second protrusion <b>35</b> is replaced by the second displacement regulation portion <b>37</b>.
