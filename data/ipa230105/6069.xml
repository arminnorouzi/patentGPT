For example, adding an oxide etching stop layer may reduce the etching defect of the back channel and improve the stability of the device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As limited by the materials, the existing materials of active layers cannot crystallize at room temperature and must be crystallized under a high temperature environment (may be micro-crystallized under a high temperature and high oxygen environment). The inventors of the present application found that: a metal oxide semiconductor material with a specific element ratio may form a crystalline phase layer at room temperature, and the crystalline phase layer formed at room temperature will have a mismatch region (i.e., a defect layer) at the growth interface.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the related art, under the circumstances that the channel layer includes two oxide semiconductor layers L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>, if the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>2</b> of crystalline phase is formed on the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>1</b> at room temperature, the material of the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>2</b> is a material crystallizable at room temperature, and a defect layer Ls is easily generated at an interface thereof due to lattice mismatch. Due to the fast etching rate of the defect layer Ls, the etchant is easy to undercut along the interface between the two oxide semiconductor layers, thereby forming an undercut in the patterning process, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, if the undercut are formed, the etchant will etch the joint position between the source/drain electrodes S/D and the channel stack layer in the subsequent source/drain etching process, resulting in the occurrence of disconnection of the source/drain electrodes (see the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>), which will reduce the stability and yield of the thin film transistor. In addition, under the circumstances that the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>2</b> is formed on the insulating layer directly at room temperature, the material of the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>2</b> is a material crystallizable at room temperature, and it is also easy to generate a defect layer at the interface between the insulating layer and the oxide semiconductor layer L<b>2</b> due to lattice mismatch.

In this case, the band gap of the channel layer <b>1410</b> is the smallest, and the energy band structure thereof is located below the seed layer <b>1420</b> and the channel layer <b>1430</b>.

Therefore, the vast majority of carriers are confined in the channel layer <b>1410</b>. The function of using the seed layer <b>1420</b> is, on the one hand, for removing the defect layer and then eliminate the issue of undercut, and on the other hand, reducing the internal interface defects and improving the stability of the device; at the same time, as a crystalline material, the seed layer <b>1420</b> is more matched with the channel layer <b>1430</b>, and the interface defects are lower; the function of the channel layer <b>1430</b> lies in that: on the one hand, the high crystallinity of the channel layer <b>1430</b> can block the etching damage from source and drain etchant, reduce the bombardment of passivation layer deposition, prevent the diffusion of source and drain electrode elements, prevent the diffusion of elements, such as oxygen, etc., on the other hand, the large band gap of the channel layer <b>1430</b> can ensure that minimum limited carriers diffuse from the channel layer <b>1410</b> to the channel layer <b>1430</b>, so as to reduce carrier loss; therefore, in the semiconductor substrate manufactured according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the carrier mobility and stability of the thin film transistor are effectively improved.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates a scanning electron micrograph of a thin film transistor in a semiconductor substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates a scanning electron micrograph of the channel stack layer of the thin film transistor in the semiconductor substrate when the channel stack layer is formed using a first etchant and the photoresist thereon has not been removed, according to an embodiment of the disclosure; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrates a scanning electron micrograph of the channel stack layer of the thin film transistor in the semiconductor substrate when the channel stack layer is formed using a second etchant and the photoresist thereon has not been removed, according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0121">The scanning electron micrograph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> corresponds to the thin film transistor in the semiconductor substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref>.

In this case, the band gap of the channel layer <b>1410</b>&#x2032; is the smallest, and the energy band structure thereof is located below the seed layer <b>1420</b>&#x2032; and the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032;. During the operation of the thin film transistor, due to the band gap difference, the carriers generated by the channel layer <b>1410</b>&#x2032; (as a material with high carrier concentration) need to cross the barrier of the band gap difference between the seed layer <b>1420</b>&#x2032; and the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032; before they can transition to other film layers. Therefore, the vast majority of carriers are confined in the channel layer <b>1410</b>&#x2032;. The function of using the seed layer <b>1420</b>&#x2032; is, on the one hand, for removing the defect layer and then eliminate the issue of undercut, and on the other hand, reducing the internal interface defects and improving the stability of the device; at the same time, as a crystalline material, the seed layer <b>1420</b>&#x2032; is more matched with the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032;, and the interface defects are lower; the function of the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032; lies in that: on the one hand, the high crystallinity of the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032; can block the etching damage from source and drain etchant, reduce the bombardment of passivation layer deposition, prevent the diffusion of source and drain electrode elements, prevent the diffusion of elements, such as oxygen, etc., on the other hand, the large band gap of the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032; can ensure that minimum limited carriers diffuse from the channel layer <b>1410</b>&#x2032; to the channel layer <b>1430</b>&#x2032;, so as to reduce carrier loss; therefore, in the semiconductor substrate manufactured according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the carrier mobility and stability of the thin film transistor are effectively improved.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0145">In the above embodiment, the semiconductor substrate serving as an active array substrate of a display device is illustrated taking an oxide semiconductor thin film transistor and the corresponding pixel structure on the semiconductor substrate as an example.
