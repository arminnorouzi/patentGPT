Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to trays, and more particularly to a tray adapted for mounting upon a steering wheel of a motor vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of the State of the Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a motor vehicle is not transporting occupants, it is often used by the occupants as a comfortable and secure setting to do tasks like eating, using an electronic device, reading, relaxing, applying cosmetic make-up, and more. Oftentimes, these tasks are facilitated with large, level surfaces where objects can be placed, such as an electronic device, food, beverage containers, eyeglasses, books, make-up, and more. Other than cupholders, a motor vehicle from the driver's seat lacks adequate provisions to hold many of these items safely and securely. Center consoles are off to the side and the area of a flat, level surface is generally too small for many items.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To address this issue at the driver seat, several tray-like products have been patented and/or are sold in the marketplace. However, all such existing products are too bulky or heavy, and/or too complicated to use, and/or too time consuming and involved to install/uninstall (especially those requiring tools to tighten or loosen clamps), and/or are too impractical/difficult to store, and/or not universally compatible enough, and/or mounted too low or too high.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Syrianos [U.S. Utility Pat. Pub. No. 2018/0304792 A1] teaches a tray with an elongated aperture that the steering wheel is allowed to pass through until the aperture is totally occupied by the steering wheel in some sort of interference fit or when the aperture end of the tray is able to rest on the protruding steering wheel hub below it. The issues with this design are numerous. The relative dimension of the steering wheel and aperture determine the placed height of the tray, necessitating different aperture dimensions for different steering wheel dimensions. Due to these geometric constraints, the top surface of the tray would be too high to conveniently type or write. Another is the cantilevered design requires both sturdy materials and substantial tray thickness to remain rigid for forces applied near the opposite edge of the aperture. Unfortunately, such a tray would be too heavy and cumbersome for many to handle. This tray is also not foldable, which complicates storage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Salinas [U.S. Design Pat. No. US D725,013 S] shows another type of tray with a tongue-like structure passing through the lower cutout of a steering wheel. The design is mounted low enough such that the tray would interfere with the thigh and lower torso of the occupant in the driver's seat. The design also appears to be non-foldable, which complicates storage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Malinski [U.S. Utility Pat. No. 5,060,581] addresses some of the aforementioned concerns with a foldable steering wheel mounted tray mounted in a more vertically central (i.e., not too high nor too low). The tray is secured to the steering wheel by a restraining strap anchored on each extent at a pair of slits at the distal ends of the panel that is substantially along the same plane as the circular plane of the steering wheel. The tray and restraining strap form a loop that during tray placement, is slipped over the top of the steering wheel and the tray is pulled &#x201c;downwardly until the loop is taut&#x201d; or &#x201c;where the maximum extent of the loop between the right and left sides equals the length of the cord formed between the two portions of the periphery of the steering wheel.&#x201d; Unfortunately, this creates a fault scenario if the steering wheel diameter is too small (sports car steering wheels can be relatively small) relative to the surrounding loop to enable this restraining condition. General applicability within one strap dimension is therefore limited. Furthermore, the inclination of the tray is adjusted by changing the length of the straps between the slits of the adjoining panels, but this length is defined by a tension constraint (strap pull stop) formed by using brads to bunch the strap ends that pass through the respective slits. This is more hassle and complicated than the approach used by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Siebert [U.S. Utility Pat. No. 5,558,026] addresses Malinski's tray securement issue by creating a rigid &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; geometry that allows the tray to be hung on the steering wheel top. However, the back panel of the pocket in the disclosed figure appears to fit around the steering wheel spoke, which appears necessary to prevent the &#x201c;body&#x201d; panel from lifting off the hub of the steering wheel. However, the problem here is the steering wheel needs to be turned prior to securement such that one steering wheel spoke is vertical as seen by the driver. Furthermore, steering wheel spoke geometry varies from vehicle to vehicle, which in turn creates another issue of general applicability, because the angle between pocket opening angle may not coincide with the angle formed between the steering wheel plane and steering wheel spoke. The rigid nature of the panels forming the pocket also makes it less universal in that it would not conform to a variety of geometries like an elastic type pouch.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another limitation is all cited patents, publications, and marketplace offerings disclose just a single tray. Finally, none of the cited patents, publications, and marketplace disclose a tray embodiment that works with steering wheels whose circular plane is substantially horizontal or substantially parallel to the vehicle floorboard, like those seen in buses, commercial heavy-duty trucks, and vehicles where the driver is over or ahead of the steered tires.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure resolves all the previously mentioned issues and offers other utilities with a novel, lightweight, simple-to-use, trivial to install and uninstall, versatile, and &#x201c;one-size-fits-all&#x201d; steering wheel tray assembly. This disclosure describes two tray assembly embodiments. One tray assembly embodiment applies for a steering wheel whose circular plane is substantially vertical or whose steering column axis is less to substantially less than approximately 60&#xb0; relative to the vehicle's floorboard. An alternative tray assembly embodiment is designed to work with steering wheels whose circular plane is substantially horizontal or is less to substantially less than approximately 60&#xb0; relative to the vehicle's floorboard to the vehicle's floorboard.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One or more of the disclosed embodiments boasts a multitude of features that is not even remotely offered by the current state-of-the-art. It begins with simple and universal fit mounting of the tray assembly, where the backing of one of the panels of one embodiment has a stretchable securement pouch that slips around the top arch of most late-model steering wheels for a snug friction fit. All embodiments can have more than one adjustable tray surfaces instead of one relatively long tray surface that extends too close or into the occupant's body. One or more occupant panels in view of the user when mounted on the steering wheel can be a whiteboard, where notes can be written and erased. The unique two-hinge architecture of one of the embodiments allows the tray assembly to function as a stand for thin electronic devices like tablets or smartphones.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The relatively flat form factor when the tray is folded (range between approximately &#xbe; inches to 1.5 inches depending upon the number of shelves and baseboard material used) lends itself to several other uses beyond its core function. For example, the folded thickness of the tray allows this tray when full folded to fill gaps between the front seat and center console or door and effectively block small items from falling through the gap occupied by the tray. An optional bib can be attached to both the tray and user and be folded away conveniently with the tray after use. The tray's folded dimension and light weight enable it to be potentially used as a sun visor extension. When the tray is fully folded, the pouch doubles as a holder of small articles like books and pens. A fully or partially folded tray can also be placed on the user's lap to be used as a &#x201c;lap tray.&#x201d;</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The drawings are provided to facilitate understanding in the detailed description.

Without any notation, these panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, <b>305</b>) signify the entire panel without consideration of a particular side. For referencing VELCRO&#xae; brand fasteners, the &#x201c;hook&#x201d; portion has no post-index notation (i.e., <b>209</b>) while the &#x201c;loop&#x201d; side has a single quotation (i.e., <b>209</b>&#x2032;).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dimensions, shape, and nature of construction described below represent those that have been proven to work in prototype testing. However, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of example and that it should not be taken as limiting the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">CONSTRUCTION OF TRAY1 (Reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>): Plastic, wood, acrylic or composite board can be substituted for each other depending upon availability, weight, use, safety, and sanitation requirements. These parts form the structure of the tray assembly unit (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>). The rigid panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>) are generally cut in 7&#xd7;15 inch rectangles with at least two panels needed to make a single shelf model. The top-most panel (<b>201</b>) may also be curved to conform to the shape of the steering wheel (<b>102</b>), but some potential space is lost for other uses, such as a whiteboard to be described later. These dimensions can be changed depending upon use or style. Additional panels can be added to make a bigger, multi-shelf device by simply repeating the attachment methods. In the illustrated two-shelf tray1 embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref>), the panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>) form the backboard structure that lays against the steering wheel (<b>102</b>). From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the illustrated bottom edge of said top-most panel (<b>201</b>) connects to the top edge of panel (<b>204</b>) in a manner to be described later when describing panel hinges. An alternative to this configuration would be to have a one-piece non-folding backboard (not shown) approximately the size of the steering wheel (<b>102</b>); however, this alternative embodiment cannot collapse to a smaller footprint and would be more difficult to stow.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Elastic cloth/band/strap, netting, or cloth/nylon material is glued, stapled, or otherwise connected to the back of top-most panel (<b>201</b>&#x2033;) to form a &#x201c;universal fit&#x201d; securement pocket (<b>203</b>) that slides on/over the steering wheel (<b>102</b>) to support tray1 (<b>200</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. This method makes the tray1 (<b>200</b>) simple and easy to use on most modern steering wheels. Alternative attachments could be made with clips or press fit clips, fold-out hooks, fabric sling, molded plastic (shaped like a steering wheel) or with VELCRO&#xae; brand fasteners, although these methods would be more inconvenient and time consuming than the preferred elastic securement pouch (<b>203</b>) attachment embodiment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Vinyl sheeting, whiteboard material, and paint/stain can cover/seal all or part of tray1 (<b>200</b>) to form a non-porous, easy-to-clean, waterproof, smooth, colored surface. Additionally, if the backboard panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>) and shelves (<b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>) are made of plastic, no paint/stain or covering is necessarily required but maybe used to change color or add a whiteboard option. The whiteboard option can cover one or more of the front surfaces of the backboard (<b>201</b>&#x2032;, <b>204</b>&#x2032;) and shelves (<b>205</b>&#x2032;, <b>208</b>&#x2032;) to allow for erasable notetaking.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The 15&#x2033; horizontal edges of the backboard (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>) and shelves (<b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>) are connected with &#x201c;book tape&#x201d; or any durable tape, cloth, plastic, rubber, silicon, vinyl, piano hinges, or accordion hinges; regardless of method (tape, vinyl, piano hinge, etc.), the element that joins one panel to another is called a &#x201c;hinge&#x201d; in this disclosure. Hinge (<b>212</b>) joins the backboard panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>) and optionally, the upper shelf panel (<b>208</b>) as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. Hinge (<b>213</b>) joins the lowest-most backboard panel (<b>204</b>) and lower shelf (<b>205</b>) as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. A panel-to-panel gap of at least &#xbd;&#x2033; between the panels is preferred prior to attaching hinges (<b>212</b>, <b>213</b>) to create the necessary clearance that enables 360&#xb0; range of motion and allow the panels to fold-up (when unit is not in use). This is the same way a &#x201c;book&#x201d; opens and closes. The preferred hinging method is book tape (<b>202</b>) or equivalent.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, each panel (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>) are taped (<b>202</b>) on both sides and the part of the tape that covers each said &#xbd;&#x2033; panel-to-panel gap forms a one-piece hinge (<b>212</b>, <b>213</b>) at the corresponding panel-to-panel junction. Alternatively, vinyl sheeting, thin plastic, or other flexible material could layer all the panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>) and said panel-to-panel gaps on both sides so that hinges (<b>212</b>, <b>213</b>) are naturally created. Next, book tape (<b>202</b>), rubber, edge trim, vinyl, plastic, or equivalent material wraps and finishes off the perimeter of the entire unit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows tray1 (<b>200</b>) in two-shelf-level form, where the upper shelf level is provided by panel (<b>208</b>) and lower shelf level is provided by panel (<b>205</b>). The upper shelf panel (<b>208</b>) is hinged at the same hinge (<b>212</b>) junction between panel (<b>201</b>) and panel (<b>204</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> except panel (<b>208</b>) is shown to be partially folded about the hinge (<b>212</b>) to show the underside surface (<b>208</b>&#x2033;) along with the VELCRO&#xae; brand &#x201c;hook&#x201d; (<b>209</b>) and &#x201c;loop&#x201d; (<b>209</b>&#x2032;) fasteners to be described later. Tray1 (<b>200</b>) can also have a single level variant, which simply does not have panel (<b>208</b>) along with the associated cords (<b>206</b>), pre-drilled cord holes (<b>207</b>), and VELCRO&#xae; brand fasteners (<b>209</b>, <b>209</b>&#x2032;).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Cords or straps (<b>206</b>) disposed through pre-drilled holes (<b>207</b>) on two or more panels (<b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, optionally <b>208</b>), is clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.

The back surfaces of tray1 (<b>201</b>&#x2033;, <b>204</b>&#x2033;, <b>205</b>&#x2033;) face away from the resting surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an electronic device, such as a &#x201c;tablet&#x201d; (<b>211</b>) placed on the back surface of panel (<b>204</b>&#x2033;) and edge of the back surface of panel (<b>201</b>&#x2033;).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the mostly side profile of tray1 (<b>200</b>) in a semi-folded state. The key here is the alternating &#x201c;Z&#x201d; style folding about the hinges (<b>212</b>, <b>213</b>) which allows the large surface area of tray1 (<b>200</b>) to be collapsible to a very compact form. The thickness of the tray1 (<b>200</b>) in fully folded state, when the top panel back surface (<b>201</b>&#x2033;) is folded flat on the middle panel back surface (<b>204</b>&#x2033;), and the middle panel front surface (<b>204</b>&#x2032;) is folded flat on the bottom panel front surface (<b>205</b>&#x2032;) all simultaneously. In this state, tray 1's (<b>200</b>) relatively thin form factor (range between approximately &#xbe; inches to 1.5 inches depending upon the number of shelves and baseboard material used) permits fitment between narrow areas of the vehicle, such as between the seat and center console or transmission driveline tunnel or door, yet is thick enough to prevent small objects from falling through and getting lost in the space occupied by the tray1 (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the plan view of the tray assembly (<b>200</b>) if the pouch (<b>203</b>) side is deemed as the top surface.

When tray1 (<b>200</b>) is opened, a washable cloth or waterproof nylon bib (not illustrated in any of the figures) can have VELCRO&#xae; brand &#x201c;hook&#x201d; fasteners attached at one edge of the bib connect to the</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">VELCRO&#xae; brand &#x201c;loop&#x201d; (<b>209</b>&#x2032;) fasteners on the bottom surface of any of the shelves (<b>205</b>&#x2033;, optionally <b>208</b>&#x2033;). The bib drapes over and shields the user's apparel from food or objects falling from above the bib. The edge of the bib opposite to the edge connected to tray1 (<b>200</b>) can connect to the user by way of an over-neck-like-leash that links the bib to the user's neck or attaches to a collar around the user's neck. This bib can neatly fold into tray1 (<b>200</b>) when the tray1 (<b>200</b>) is closed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A fully or partially folded tray1 (<b>200</b>) can also be placed on the user's lap to be used as a &#x201c;lap tray.&#x201d; Tray1 (<b>200</b>) when folded has the combination of lightweight and dimensions to be potentially used as a sun visor extension when the vehicle is parked. These uses are not directly illustrated in any of the figures.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">CONSTRUCTION OF TRAY2 (Reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>): Much of the other existing steering wheel trays cater to the type of steering wheel (<b>102</b>) where the circular plane is substantially vertical or whose steering column axis (<b>101</b>) is less to substantially less than 60&#xb0; relative to the vehicle's floorboard. However, for vehicles like many heavy-duty commercial trucks, buses, and some vans where the driver sits nearly over or ahead of the steered tires, such a tray would not be mountable nor functional even if mountable because the tray surfaces would be substantially tilted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">This scenario necessitates a different approach, and the present invention discloses an alternative embodiment for such applications, called tray2 (<b>300</b>) in this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref> show this alternative embodiment and is made of elements/parts (<b>301</b>-<b>308</b>). All the materials and recommendations to make the boards, surface covers, and hinges of tray2 (<b>300</b>) can be the same ones indicated in the disclosure of the earlier mentioned tray1 (<b>200</b>). Tray2 panels (<b>301</b>, <b>303</b>, <b>305</b>), when mounted on the steering wheel (<b>103</b>), has a similar but slightly smaller overall diameter than the inner diameter of the steering wheel (<b>103</b>), allowing it drop/press in place. The substantially horizontal upper level panel (<b>301</b>) closest to the 12 o'clock position of the steering wheel is hinged (<b>302</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The same hinge (<b>302</b>) is connected to one end of the substantially vertical panel (<b>303</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Panel (<b>303</b>) is hinged (<b>304</b>) at the other edge as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The same hinge (<b>304</b>) is shared with the substantially horizontal lower level panel (<b>305</b>) closest to the 6 o'clock position of the steering wheel. Without straps, tray2 can be secured to said steering wheel (<b>103</b>) by placing tray2 within the inner diameter of said steering wheel (<b>103</b>) and more closely to the 6 o'clock position of said steering wheel (<b>103</b>) than to the 12 o'clock position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, with the near edge portions of the panel surface (<b>305</b>&#x2032;) tucked under the steering wheel (<b>103</b>) near the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock portion of the steering wheel (<b>103</b>). At the same time, tray2's panel (<b>305</b>) can be shaped with a small tongue-like extension that rides on top of the steering wheel (<b>103</b>) near the 6 o'clock position. This below-above-below style of steering wheel (<b>103</b>) securement will cause panel (<b>305</b>) to deflect some to create an interference fit between tray2 (<b>300</b>) and the steering wheel (<b>103</b>) to keep tray2 (<b>300</b>) from easily sliding around.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The radial periphery of the surface (<b>306</b>) has a stitched bezel throughout the entire circumference of the tray (<b>300</b>). The bezel (<b>306</b>) can alternatively be press sealed or melded plastic, taped, or press fitted with edging material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a securement embodiment without support straps since the steering wheel (<b>103</b>) itself is the horizontal support for the tray (<b>300</b>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a supplemental securement embodiment comprising of a novel strap with a VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener (<b>307</b>). The strap (<b>307</b>) with a VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener (not shown) holds the upper level panel (<b>301</b>) of the tray2 (<b>300</b>) horizontal (closest to the dashboard) and is adjustable for height because of the length VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener along the strap (<b>307</b>) is long enough to offer adjustability. The strap (<b>307</b>) with a VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener is rigid since it has an approximately 1 inch&#xd7;3 inch strip of the &#x201c;backing board&#x201d; (same as that used on the shelves) sandwiched between the &#x201c;hook and loop&#x201d; parts of the VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener. This unique feature allows vertical height adjustment but not much lateral movement since the internal board adds strength and stability. To further clarify, if the presented embodiment has 1 inch wide by 5-inch-long strap (<b>307</b>) with a VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener, the bottom three or four inches is not flexible, but the remaining portion is. The rigid part of the strap (<b>307</b>) with a VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener is aligned vertically so said strap engages the bottom side of said steering wheel (<b>103</b>) and is held in place by the VELCRO&#xae; brand fastener. The strap (<b>307</b>) loops over the 12 o'clock portion of the steering wheel (<b>103</b>) to lock the tray (<b>300</b>) in place. One end of the strap (<b>307</b>) is stitched to the portion of the upper level panel (<b>301</b>), but the method of attachment need not be limited to stitching.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments.
