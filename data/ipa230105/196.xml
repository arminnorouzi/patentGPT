Motorcycle helmets are estimated to be 37% effective in preventing fatal injuries to motorcycle operators, and 41% effective for motorcycle passengers. However, many motorcycle riders may choose not to wear a motorcycle helmet due to their distaste regarding the look or appearance of motorcycle helmets available on the market today. This is obviously undesirable, as a motorcycle rider's safety greatly increases when wearing a motorcycle helmet. In addition, motorcycle riders often use a GPS or the GPS on their mobile phone to navigate on long motorcycle rides. When doing so, the GPS or mobile phone is typically mounted near the handlebars of the motorcycle. However, this can be dangerous because to view the GPS while riding a motorcycle, a rider must avert their eyes from the road and towards the position of the GPS/mobile phone. This is undesirable as it could lead to motorcycle accidents or crashes, which are often fatal. Finally, motorcycle riders are often involved in accidents at night, due to the fact that other drivers on the roadway cannot easily see the motorcycle or rider.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there exists a long-felt need in the art for an improved motorcycle helmet. There also exists in the art a long-felt need for a motorcycle helmet device that presents a more visually appealing helmet option for motorcycle riders. Further, there exists a long-felt need in the art for a motorcycle helmet device that allows a user to view a GPS without averting his or her eyes from a roadway while driving a motorcycle. Finally, there exist a long-felt need in the art for a motorcycle helmet device that ensures a wearer can be adequately seen at night.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a motorcycle helmet device.
