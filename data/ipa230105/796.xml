For example, in some embodiments, methods are provided for treating side effects associated with the administration of levodopa (L-DOPA) to a subject having Parkinson's disease, by administering a dose of ketamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In particular, the invention provides methods for reducing dyskinesia associated with motor disorder (e.g., Parkinson's disease) treatments, and effective doses of ketamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Parkinson's disease (PD) is the 2<sup>nd </sup>most common progressive neurodegenerative disease with the cardinal motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, postural instability and bradykinesia (Olanow et al., 2009). These motor symptoms correspond to the loss of dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located in the substantia nigra and axonal projections to the striatum leading to reduced dopamine (DA) levels. The most common treatment for PD consists of DA replacement therapy utilizing either the DA precursor L-DOPA or DA receptor agonists. These therapies become unsatisfactory as the disease progresses due to a variety of short-term and long-term side effects that occur with dose escalation, including the most common and debilitating side effect L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-dopaminergic therapies. An effective treatment of LID to extend the useful lifetime of L-DOPA treatment is a critical unmet need in PD therapy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Low-dose sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion treatment has led to a long-term reduction of treatment-resistant depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, as well as reduction of chronic pain states, including migraine headaches. Ketamine also is known to change oscillatory electric brain activity. One commonality between migraine headaches, depression, PTSD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is hypersynchrony of electric activity in the brain, including the basal ganglia. Therefore, experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention investigated the use of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of PD and LID. A long-term therapeutic effect of low-dose ketamine infusion (0.15-0.3 mg/kg/hr for 72 hrs) from five PD patient case studies (reduced dyskinesia, improved on time, and reduced depression) was shown. Additionally, ketamine (5-20 mg/kg) led to long-term dose-dependent reduction of abnormal involuntary movements in a preclinical rodent model of LID, but only when low-dose ketamine was given for 10 hours and not with a single acute low-dose ketamine injection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, this invention provides methods utilizing ketamine for the treatment of motor disorders and/or side effects associated with certain medications used in the treatment of motor disorders. For example, in some embodiments, methods are provided for treating side effects associated with the administration of levodopa to a subject having Parkinson's disease, by administering a dose of ketamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In particular, the invention provides methods for reducing dyskinesia associated with motor disorder (e.g., Parkinson's disease) treatments, and effective doses of ketamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods of preventing, attenuating, and/or treating a patient suffering from a motor disorder, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a dose of ketamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to ameliorate the symptoms of the motor disorder. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise administration of carbidopa.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered at a dose from about 0.15 mg/kg/hour to about 10 mg/kg/hour for at least two hours (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 72, 100, etc). In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered at a dose from about 0.15 mg/kg/hour to about 5 mg/kg/hour for at least two hours (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 72, 100, etc). In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered at a dose from about 0.15 mg/kg/hour to about 2 mg/kg/hour for at least two hours (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 72, 100, etc). In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered at a dose from about 0.15 mg/kg/hour to about .5 mg/kg/hour for at least two hours (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 72, 100, etc). In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered at a dose from about 0.15 mg/kg/hour to about 0.3 mg/kg/hour for at least two hours (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 72, 100, etc).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the ketamine is administered in a delayed release formulation. In some embodiments, the patient is human.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, administration of the composition comprising a dose of ketamine results in the patient experiencing chemical-induced deep brain stimulation. In some embodiments, such chemical-induced deep brain stimulation results in prevention, attenuation and/or treating of the symptoms of the motor disorder.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the motor disorder is dyskinesia. In some embodiments, the motor disorder is tardive dyskinesia.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the motor disorder is selected from the group consisting of Parkinson's disease, dopamine-responsive dystonia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the motor disorder is a side effect associated with administration of a medication to the patient. In some embodiments, the medication is a medication known to be useful for treating a neurodegenerative disorder.

These motor symptoms correspond to the loss of dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located in the substantia nigra and axonal projections to the striatum leading to reduced dopamine (DA) levels. The most common treatment for PD consists of DA replacement therapy utilizing either the DA precursor L-DOPA or DA receptor agonists. These therapies become unsatisfactory as the disease progresses due to a variety of short-term and long-term side effects that occur with dose escalation, including the most common and debilitating side effect L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-dopaminergic therapies. An effective treatment of LID to extend the useful lifetime of L-DOPA treatment is a critical unmet need in PD therapy.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Low-dose ketamine is used to treat various chronic pain syndromes, especially those that have a neuropathic component, and studies on the effect of prolonged infusion (4-14 days) show long-term analgesic effects up to 3 months following infusion (Niesters et al., 2014). Recent publications also showed that low-dose ketamine infusion paradigms are safe and well tolerated in clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression (Diamond et al., 2014; Lapidus et al., 2014; Murrough, Iosifescu, et al., 2013; Murrough, Perez, et al., 2013) and PTSD (Feder et al., 2014). Low-dose ketamine has led to a reduction of treatment-resistant depression; it also reduced PTSD symptom severity and comorbid depression. The pathophysiology of LID and motor fluctuations is uncertain, although hypotheses include an imbalance between the direct and indirect striatofugal pathways within the basal ganglia (BG), due to repeated daily administration of L-DOPA, the production of &#x201c;denervation super sensitivity&#x201d; of DA receptors, and as a result also hypersynchrony of electric activity and maladaptive plastic changes in the brain, including in the BG, which is a commonality between LID, depression and PTSD. Based on this information it was hypothesized that use of low-dose ketamine infusions might help with treatment of PD, especially LID. Therefore, low-dose-ketamine infusions were investigated in five PD patient case studies and the standard preclinical LID model.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention investigated the use of low-dose ketamine in the treatment of PD and LID. A long-term therapeutic effect of low-dose ketamine infusion (0.15-0.3 mg/kg/hr for 72 hrs) from five PD patient case studies (reduced dyskinesia, improved on time, and reduced depression) was shown. Additionally, in a preclinical rodent model of LID, ketamine (5-20 mg/kg) led to long-term dose-dependent reduction of abnormal involuntary movements, only when low-dose ketamine was given for 10 hours and not with a single acute low-dose ketamine injection. The utility of ketamine for preoperative management with Parkinson's Disease patients has been described (see, e.g., Wright, et al., 2009), wherein an acute effect of ketamine on levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is detected. The technology described herein, however, is not derivative of this unsurprising and expected observation. Indeed, an acute effect of ketamine and other NMDA-blocking drugs on LID is well-known. For example, the NMDA blocking drug, amantadine is in routine clinical use to acutely treat LID. The acute effect of ketamine, described by Wright et al., is only useful in the proscribed setting of anesthesia care. In contrast, the technology described herein pertains to the use of a particular and unique treatment protocol that induces long-lasting or permanent beneficial effects to reduce or eliminate LID. Such technology describes a separate line of reasoning built on separate experimental observations and clinical practice. Unlike the use of ketamine for acute effects, the treatment regimen described herein involves continuous infusion of low-dose ketamine which cannot be attributed to the mere presence of an NMDA-blocking drug producing a simple pharmacological effect. Blockade of NMDA receptors alone as theorized by Wright et al. does not lead to an extended beneficial effect. Instead, as shown by the experiments described herein, long-lasting effects are dependent on additional properties of ketamine acting though other neurological mechanisms such as the induction of specific changes in the oscillatory activity of brain regions affected by Parkinson disease.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, the experimental findings described herein show that low-dose-ketamine infusion also has a preventative effect by reducing the severity of LID when used during the period of developing LID.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, this invention encompasses preventing, attenuating, and/or treating a motor disorder and/or side effects related to the treatment of a motor disorder.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, this invention encompasses use of ketamine and derivatives thereof (e.g., metabolites of ketamine) for preventing, attenuating, and/or treating a motor disorder including, but not limited to, Parkinson's disease, dopamine-responsive dystonia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, this invention encompasses use of ketamine and derivatives thereof for preventing, attenuating, and/or treating side effects related to the treatment of a motor disorder (e.g., side effects or movement disorders that are associated with dopamine-related drugs) (e.g., L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID)).

completed all-day diaries of his motor fluctuations, and underwent close clinical observation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, B). This patient was treated for intractable back pain due to severe lumbar degenerative disk disease which was exacerbated by often severe and violent dyskinesia. During admission, no adjustments were made to the dosages of carbidopa/L-DOPA or other medications, yet his dyskinesia improved markedly during and after the infusion. He was free of dyskinesia at the time of a second infusion 3 years later despite an increase in L-DOPA dose. At that time the patient was noted to have severe tremor, which resolved acutely during the infusion. Unlike the dyskinesia, the beneficial effect on tremor was short-lived since the tremor had returned at a follow-up visit 3 weeks later. The patient continues to be followed by one of the investigators (SJS) and has remained free of dyskinesia.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">Similarly, in case #2 there was a dramatic reduction in dyskinesia as reported by one of the authors (ME) though less quantitative data is available from chart review. Notably, prior amantadine (200 mg daily) treatment had failed to improve his LID.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0088">Case #3 was a patient with severe back pain, depression, and advanced PD. Ketamine dramatically improved the patient's depression, pain, and acutely improved his motor symptoms. The patient had significant comorbid medical problems including reduced cardiac ejection fraction, and arrhythmia. Though dyskinesia was not the most prominent feature of his motor symptomatology, it is notable that it completely subsided following the infusion, and that there was acute improvement in other aspects of the motor exam during the infusion. His depression was dramatically improved (Table 1, patient was suicidal before infusion and only mildly depressed on subsequent follow-up visits, followed by SJS). This case supports the safety and feasibility of using low-dose ketamine even in patients of advanced age and with comorbid conditions.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0089">Cases #4 and 5 had intractable headache and relatively early-onset PD, treated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) which had previously resolved their dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. In case #4 the headache occurred after DBS placement and may have been related to hardware placement, in case #5 the headache preceded DBS placement. The headache was improved in case #4, but in case #5 the patient requested the infusion be aborted due to non-efficacy and non-specific side effects. These cases are included for completeness of documentation and safety data but there was little effect on motor symptoms. Though in case #4, the intensity of DBS stimulation was reduced by 0.3 volts bilaterally with improvement of stimulation induced dysarthria without loss of motor benefit.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0090">Preclinical data: Studies were conducted in the standard preclinical rat LID model (Dekundy et al., 2007). Verification for the unilateral lesion in both cohorts is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, B. The rats in cohort #1 showed severe LID and a dose-dependent long-term anti-dyskinetic effect of low-dose ketamine when given for a 10 hr period was demonstrated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>,B); to mimic the patient infusion ketamine was injected 5 x i.p. two hrs apart, 7 mg/kg L-DOPA was co-injected at the 5<sup>th </sup>injection, and then the abnormal involuntary movements-(AIMs) scores were evaluated. This approach was used as it is not possible to use a regular infusion in a behaving rat and given the long-term nature of the experiment clogging of surgically inserted mini-pumps was a concern. After a 5 mg/kg ketamine-&#x2018;infusion&#x2019;, there was a reduction of the AIMs score that lasted 7 days post-injection, before the baseline level (black dashed line) was reached again. After the 10 mg/kg ketamine-&#x2018;infusion&#x2019; it took 10 days before the baseline AIMs score was reached again and after the 15 mg/kg ketamine-&#x2018;infusion&#x2019;, it took 31 days before the baseline AIMs score level was reached again. Most impressive, however, was the effect of 20 mg/kg ketamine-&#x2018;infusion&#x2019;, which resulted in a persistent reduction of AIMs scores that lasted for at least 55 days post-injection, and what appeared to be a new lower stable AIMs level was established (blue dashed line). A 10 mg/kg ketamine-&#x2018;infusion&#x2019; was given after these treatments to test for sensitization resulting from ketamine treatment. No change in the already-reduced AIMs score was observed following this dosage, suggesting that reduced AIMs scores following the 20 mg/kg injection was not due to sensitization. At all the tested doses ketamine did not significantly change L-DOPA-induced contralateral locomotor behavior (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), and specifically did not acutely induce the ipsiversive turning behavior that is indicative of a worsening of the Parkinsonism in this model, as it has been shown by the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 (Flores et al., 2014; Paquette et al., 2010). To investigate if the longer exposure to ketamine is necessary a separate cohort #2 of rats with moderate LID was tested to see if an acute ketamine injection would also be anti-dyskinetic (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>). The rats were primed and tested with 5 mg/kg L-DOPA, and two acute i.p. injections of 15 mg/kg ketamine (fourteen days apart) did not lead to any change in the AIMs scores.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example II</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0091">This example demonstrates that a low-dose sub-anesthetic racemic ketamine infusion once a week reduces the development of LID in a preclinical model. Unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned PD rats were injected daily with L-DOPA (days 0-13: 6 mg/kg; days 14-28: 12 mg/kg; i.p.) to induce dyskinesia and tested for limb, axial and oral (LAO) abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) twice a week for 3 hours by blinded investigators.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows the mean LAO AIMs scores&#xb1;SEM are plotted showing a 50% reduction after racemic low-dose ketamine infusions.

The black lines depict the mean value per groups.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">This data indicates that racemic ketamine infusions reduces the development of dyskinesia and therefore is indicative for early use in the treatment of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example III</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0095">This example describes the effects of racemic ketamine injection (20 mg/kg) on high-frequency (HFO) and beta band oscillations in the motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096">Using the 10-hour racemic ketamine paradigm (5 i.p. injections every 2 hours), simultaneous local-field activity in multiple brain structures in two awake and behaving naive rats was measured.
