BACKGROUND ART Typically, a medical suture thread used for medical action such as a surgery or injury treatment has been used. Of this medical suture thread, an outer surface is coated with various resin materials for the purpose of improving operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance (the easiness of moving a knot upon thread tying) on a sutured portion. For example, Patent Literature 1 below discloses that a suture thread is coated with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (hereinafter referred to as “MPC”). This can enhance easiness and retainability when a surgeon ties the suture thread. CITATION LIST Patent Literature PATENT LITERATURE 1: JP-A-2010-513678 However, there has been a problem that the suture thread described in Patent Literature 1 above is likely to remain curled after the suture thread housed in a packaging container with wound in a circular ring shape is taken out of the packaging container. In addition, there has also been a problem that it is difficult to uncurl the suture thread from a curled state. The present invention has been made to cope with the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a medical suture thread which is less likely to remain curled or is easily uncurled from a curled state. SUMMARY OF INVENTION In order to achieve the above object, as a feature of the present invention, there is provided a medical suture thread including a single thread having one or a plurality of fibrous ultrafine threads. A cover layer made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed on an outer surface of each ultrafine thread, and the cover layer is formed to have a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to a total weight of a filament forming each ultrafine thread, the cover layer being formed on the filament. According to the feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament forming the ultrafine thread. With this configuration, according to experiment conducted by the present inventor, operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance on a sutured portion are improved. In addition, it has been confirmed that the medical suture thread housed in a circular ring shape in a packaging container is less likely to remain curled or is easily uncurled from a curled state. Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to have a weight of equal to or greater than 0.1% and less than 0.3% with respect to a total weight of a filament forming each ultrafine thread, the cover layer being formed on the filament. According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.1% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament forming the ultrafine thread. Thus, the medical suture thread can be easily formed as compared to the case of forming the cover layer with a weight of less than 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament. Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed such that part of an outer surface of the filament is exposed. According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed such that part of the outer surface of the filament is exposed. Thus, the cover layer is not necessarily formed across the entirety of the outer surface of the filament. Consequently, the amount of MPC to be used and a burden in the process of forming the cover layer can be reduced. Accordingly, the cover layer can be efficiently formed. Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to cover 50% or more of a surface area of the filament with a uniform formation density in each of an axial direction and a peripheral direction of the filament. According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to cover 50% or more of the surface area of the filament with the uniform formation density in each of an axial direction and a peripheral direction of the filament. Thus, the cover layer made of MPC can maintain various characteristics such as the operability, the slidability, and the slide-down performance while the amount of MPC to be used and the burden in the process of forming the cover layer can be reduced. Consequently, the cover layer can be efficiently formed.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, one embodiment of a medical suture thread according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of a medical suture thread 100 according to the present invention. Note that in each figure as a reference in the present specification, some components are schematically shown using, e.g., exaggerated notation for the sake of easy understanding of the present invention. Thus, the dimensions of the components, the ratios among the components, and the like may vary. The medical suture thread 100 is a tool for suturing part of body tissues such as the skin, muscles, or organs of a human or an animal. (Configuration of Medical Suture Thread 100 ) The medical suture thread 100 mainly includes a core thread 110 and an outer thread 120 . The core thread 110 is a thread arranged inside the medical suture thread 100 . The core thread 110 includes an assembly of multiple ultrafine threads 111 . In the present embodiment, two bundles of multiple assembled ultrafine threads 111 are twisted to form a single thread in the configuration of the core thread 110 . Thus, the core thread 110 is, in the present embodiment, formed to have a thickness of about 0.27 mm. As shown in FIG. 2 , the ultrafine thread 111 is the minimum unit of thread forming the core thread 110 . The ultrafine thread 111 includes a filament 111 a made of a resin material, a natural material, or a metal material. In this case, the resin material to be used may include, for example, nylon, polypropylene, polyester, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The natural material to be used may include catgut (a thread formed of twisted animal intestines) and a silken thread. The metal material to be used may include stainless steel, titanium, and magnesium. The thickness of the ultrafine thread 111 varies according to the thickness of the medical suture thread 100 . The ultrafine thread 111 is formed such that the thickness thereof is equal to or greater than about 1 μm and equal to or less than about 1 mm. In the present embodiment, the ultrafine thread 111 is formed of a polyester thread with a thickness of about 10 μm. In the ultrafine thread 111 , an inner-filament cover layer 112 is formed on a surface of the filament 111 a . The inner-filament cover layer 112 is a resin layer covering the outer surface of the filament 111 a of the ultrafine thread 111 and containing 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC). In this case, the inner-filament cover layer 112 may be made only of MPC. Alternatively, the inner-filament cover layer 112 may be formed such that MPC is contained as a main component, of which content rate is the highest as compared to the other components, among the components forming the inner-filament cover layer 112 . In the present embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer 112 is made only of MPC. The inner-filament cover layer 112 is preferably formed to completely cover the outer surface of the filament 111 a . The inner-filament cover layer 112 may be formed to cover 50% or more (more preferably 80% or more) of the surface area of the filament 111 a with the substantially uniform formation density in each of axial and peripheral directions of the filament 111 a . That is, the inner-filament cover layer 112 may be, as shown in FIG. 3 , formed on the outer surface of the filament 111 a in a patchy manner with part of the outer surface being exposed. The substantially uniform formation density in each of the axial and peripheral directions of the filament 111 a as described herein indicates a state in which a portion (a portion formed with no inner-filament cover layer 112 ) with the exposed outer surface of the filament 111 a and a portion formed with the inner-filament cover layer 112 are substantially equally arranged in each of the axial and peripheral directions of the filament 111 a . It may only be required that when the outer surface of the filament 111 a is observed using a magnifying glass such as an electronic microscope, the formation density is substantially uniform to such an extent that the exposed portion of the outer surface of the filament 111 a and the portion of the outer surface formed with the inner-filament cover layer 112 seem to be equally arranged. Such arrangement is not necessarily precisely-equal arrangement. The inner-filament cover layer 112 is formed on the outer surface of the filament 111 a within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 111 a . That is, the inner-filament cover layer 112 is formed on the outer surface of the filament 111 a within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 111 a . This can reduce hardening of the medical suture thread 100 . Moreover, flexibility can be held. In this case, the thickness of the inner-filament cover layer 112 is set according to use application of the medical suture thread 100 or a user's preference. In the present embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer 112 is formed on the outer surface of the filament 111 a with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament 111 a. The outer thread 120 is a thread arranged to cover an outer surface of the above-described core thread 110 . The outer thread 120 includes an assembly of multiple ultrafine threads 121 . In the present embodiment, the outer thread 120 is formed in such a manner that six bundles of multiple assembled ultrafine threads 121 are braided to form a single thread. Thus, the outer thread 120 is formed with a thickness of about 0.6 mm in the present embodiment. That is, in the present embodiment, the medical suture thread 100 is formed with a thickness of about 0.6 mm. The outer thread 120 is formed to completely cover the outer surface of the core thread 110 . The ultrafine thread 121 is the minimum unit of thread forming the outer thread 120 . The ultrafine thread 121 includes a filament 121 a made of a resin material, a natural material, or a metal material. In this case, the resin material to be used may include, for example, nylon, polypropylene, polyester, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The natural material to be used may include catgut (a thread formed of twisted animal intestines) and a silken thread. The metal material to be used may include stainless steel, titanium, and magnesium. The thickness of the ultrafine thread 121 varies according to the thickness of the medical suture thread 100 . The ultrafine thread 121 is formed such that the thickness thereof is equal to or greater than about 1 μm and equal to or less than about 1 mm. In the present embodiment, the ultrafine thread 121 is formed of a polyester thread with a thickness of about 10 μm. That is, the ultrafine threads 121 is formed of the exact same thread as that of the ultrafine thread 111 in the present embodiment. Note that the ultrafine thread 121 is formed as necessary according to the specifications of the medical suture thread 100 . Thus, the ultrafine thread 121 may be made of a material different from that of the ultrafine thread 111 , and/or may be formed with a diameter different from that of the ultrafine thread 111 , needless to say. As shown in FIG. 2 , in the ultrafine thread 121 , an outer-filament cover layer 122 is formed on a surface of the filament 121 a . The outer-filament cover layer 122 is a resin layer covering the outer surface of the filament 121 a and containing 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC). In this case, the outer-filament cover layer 122 may be made only of MPC. Alternatively, the outer-filament cover layer 122 may be formed such that MPC is contained as a main component, of which content rate is the highest as compared to the other components, among the components forming the outer-filament cover layer 122 . The outer-filament cover layer 122 may be made of a resin material other than MPC or synthetic resin containing, as a main component, resin other than MPC. In the present embodiment, the outer-filament cover layer 122 is made only of MPC. The outer-filament cover layer 122 is preferably formed to completely cover the outer surface of the filament 121 a . The outer-filament cover layer 122 may be formed to cover 50% or more (more preferably 80% or more) of the surface area of the ultrafine thread 121 with a substantially uniform formation density in each of axial and peripheral directions of the filament 121 a . That is, the outer-filament cover layer 122 may be, as shown in FIG. 3 , formed on the outer surface of the filament 121 a in a patchy manner with part of the outer surface being exposed. Note that the substantially uniform formation density in each of the axial and peripheral directions of the filament 121 a as described herein is similar to that of the inner-filament cover layer 112 . Thus, description thereof will be omitted. The outer-filament cover layer 122 is formed on the outer surface of the filament 121 a within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 121 a . That is, the outer-filament cover layer 122 is formed on the outer surface of the filament 121 a within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 121 a . This can provide the flexibility or smooth texture of the medical suture thread 100 . In this case, the thickness of the outer-filament cover layer 122 is set according to use application of the medical suture thread 100 or a user's preference. In the present embodiment, the outer-filament cover layer 122 is, as in the inner-filament cover layer 112 , formed on the outer surface of the filament 121 a with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament 121 a. That is, the ultrafine thread 121 has the exact same configuration as that of the ultrafine thread 111 in the present embodiment. Note that the outer-filament cover layer 122 with a configuration different from that of the inner-filament cover layer 112 may be formed. Alternatively, the ultrafine thread 121 may be formed without the outer-filament cover layer 122 . Note that FIG. 1 shows one extracted ultrafine thread 111 and one extracted ultrafine thread 121 for the sake of easy understanding of the internal structure of the medical suture thread 100 . In addition, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are not shown in the figure. Each of FIGS. 2 and 3 shows, by one common view, the ultrafine thread 111 and the ultrafine thread 121 . (Manufacturing of Medical Suture Thread 100 ) Next, the process of manufacturing the medical suture thread 100 will be described. A worker manufacturing the medical suture thread 100 first prepares the ultrafine thread 111 formed with no inner-filament cover layer 112 and the ultrafine thread 121 formed with no outer-filament cover layer 122 . Specifically, the filaments 111 a , 121 a are prepared as bases of the ultrafine threads 111 , 121 . In this case, the filaments 111 a , 121 a are manufactured by the typical technique of manufacturing a suture thread. Thus, the worker may manufacture the filaments 111 a , 121 a as the bases of the ultrafine threads 111 , 121 by the worker oneself. Alternatively, a commercially-available filament may be purchased and obtained. In the present embodiment, the worker prepares the polyester filaments 111 a , 121 a with a size of No. 11-0 (about 20 μm) (the standard for a suture thread according to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act). Next, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 on the filaments 111 a , 121 a . Specifically, the worker dips the filaments 111 a , 121 a in a solution (e.g., an ethanol solution) containing MPC. In this manner, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 can be formed on the surfaces of the filaments 111 a , 121 a. In this case, the worker can dip the filament in the solution containing MPC in a state in which the multiple filaments 111 a , 121 a are gathered and bundled, a roll state in which each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a is wound in an annular shape, or a state in which each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a wound in a roll shape is drawn in a linear shape. The concentration of the solution containing MPC and the time of dipping the filaments 111 a , 121 a are respectively determined as necessary according to the thicknesses of the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 to be formed. Then, the worker performs drying treatment and sterilization treatment for the filaments 111 a , 121 a taken out of the solution containing MPC. In this manner, the worker can obtain the ultrafine threads 111 , 121 formed with the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 on the outer surfaces of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. Note that the worker provides vibration to the filaments 111 a , 121 a or sets a drying temperature to a high temperature upon drying of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , and in this manner, can form the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 on the surfaces of the filaments 111 a , 121 a in a patchy manner. Next, the worker forms the core thread 110 . Specifically, the worker twists two bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads 111 by means of a not-shown twisting machine. In this manner, the single core thread 110 is formed. In the present embodiment, the worker can form the core thread 110 with a thickness of about 0.27 mm. Next, the worker forms the outer thread 120 . Specifically, the worker braids the outer thread 120 , which is formed of five bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads 121 , on the outside of the core thread 110 by means of a not-shown braiding machine. In this manner, a single thread is formed. That is, by the step of forming the outer thread 120 , the medical suture thread 100 including the core thread 110 completely covered with the outer thread 120 is formed. The medical suture thread 100 is formed with an outer diameter of about 0.6 mm in the present embodiment. Next, the worker can complete the medical suture thread 100 through the steps of sterilizing, checking, and packing the medical suture thread 100 . In this case, the medical suture thread 100 is housed in a packaging container (not shown) in a state in which the medical suture thread 100 is wound in a circular ring shape. Alternatively, the medical suture thread 100 may be packed with a medical tool such as a suture needle being coupled to a tip end portion of the medical suture thread 100 . Note that the worker can form the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 on a medical suture thread 100 formed with no inner-filament cover layer 112 and no outer-filament cover layer 122 . Specifically, the worker processes the filaments 111 a by means of the not-shown twisting machine. After formation of the core thread 110 , the ultrafine threads 121 are braided using the not-shown braiding machine and the filaments 121 a . In this manner, the medical suture thread 100 (i.e., a half-finished product of the medical suture thread 100 ) is formed at an outer peripheral portion of the core thread 110 . Next, the worker dips the half-finished product of the medical suture thread 100 in the solution containing MPC. In this case, the worker causes a sufficient solution to penetrate the medical suture thread 100 to each ultrafine thread 111 (each filament 111 a ) forming the core thread 110 . In this case, the worker can intermittently change tension to be applied to the half-finished product of the medical suture thread 100 in the solution containing MPC. In this manner, a sufficient solution can penetrate the medical suture thread 100 to each ultrafine thread 111 (each filament 111 a ) forming the core thread 110 . In this manner, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 on the outer surfaces of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. Accordingly, the worker can obtain the medical suture thread 100 formed of the ultrafine threads 111 , 121 including these filaments and cover layers. (Operation of Medical Suture Thread 100 ) Next, operation of the medical suture thread 100 configured as described above will be described. A user such as a doctor couples a medical tool (not shown) such as a suture needle to the medical suture thread 100 unpacked from the package. Then, the user takes medical action such as a surgery or injury treatment. In this case, in the medical suture thread 100 , the inner-filament cover layer 112 formed on the ultrafine thread 111 is formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament 111 a . Moreover, the outer-filament cover layer 122 formed on the ultrafine thread 121 is formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament 121 a . Thus, the medical suture thread 100 is less likely to remain curled. In addition, even in a case where the medical suture thread 100 remains curled, the medical suture thread 100 is uncurled from a curled state within a short period of time, and extends straight. In this case, in a state in which the medical suture thread 100 is wound in the circular ring shape, adjacent turns of the medical suture thread 100 are less likely to adhere to each other. Thus, the user can easily extend the medical suture thread 100 straight. Moreover, the user takes medical action such as removal of the medical suture thread 100 sutured to an affected area of a patient. In this case, in the medical suture thread 100 , not only the outer thread 120 but also the core thread 110 inside the outer thread 120 are arranged, and the inner-filament cover layer 112 made of MPC is formed as an outer layer of each ultrafine thread 111 forming the core thread 110 . Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads 111 is reduced. Consequently, the medical suture thread 100 is easily bendable. As a result, the user can easily operate the medical suture thread 100 . As can be understood from description of operation above, according to the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread 100 , a cover layer including the inner-filament cover layer 112 made of MPC is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 111 a forming the ultrafine thread 111 . Moreover, a cover layer including the outer-filament cover layer 122 made of MPC is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament 121 a forming the ultrafine thread 121 . With this configuration, the medical suture thread 100 housed in the circular ring shape in the packaging container is less likely to remain curled, or can be easily uncurled from the curled state. Further, the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. Various changes can be made to the above-described embodiment without departing from the object of the present invention. For example, in the above-described embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. That is, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are equivalent to the cover layer according to the present invention. However, according to experiment conducted by the present inventor, it may only be required that the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are formed within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. In this case, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are formed within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.1% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. With this configuration, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 can easily form the cover layer as compared to the case of forming such a layer with a weight of less than 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a. In the above-described embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 are formed as a coating completely covering the outer surfaces of the filaments 111 a , 121 a , respectively. However, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 may be respectively formed such that part of the outer surface of each of the filaments 111 a , 121 a is exposed as shown in FIG. 3 . With this configuration, in the medical suture thread 100 , the inner-filament cover layer 112 or the outer-filament cover layer 122 is not necessarily formed across the entirety of the outer surface of the filament 111 a or 121 a . Thus, the amount of MPC to be used and a burden in the process of forming the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 can be reduced. Accordingly, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 can be efficiently formed. In the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread 100 , the inner-filament cover layer 112 is formed on the ultrafine thread 111 forming the core thread 110 . Moreover, the outer-filament cover layer 122 is formed on the ultrafine thread 121 forming the outer thread 120 . However, it may only be required that in the configuration of the medical suture thread 100 , the inner-filament cover layer 112 or the outer-filament cover layer 122 is formed on the ultrafine thread 111 or the ultrafine thread 121 forming one of the core thread 110 or the outer thread 120 . In this case, in the medical suture thread 100 , the outer-filament cover layer 122 can be formed only on the outer thread 120 or the outer thread 120 exposed at an outer surface of the medical suture thread 100 . With this configuration, operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance on a sutured portion can be improved. In addition, the medical suture thread 100 is less likely to remain curled, or can be easily uncurled from the curled state. In the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread 100 , the inner-filament cover layer 112 of the ultrafine thread 111 forming the core thread 110 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 of the ultrafine thread 121 forming the outer thread 120 are formed with the same thickness (a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the ultrafine threads 111 , 121 ). However, the inner-filament cover layer 112 and the outer-filament cover layer 122 may be formed with different thicknesses. Thus, the inner-filament cover layer 112 may be formed thinner than the outer-filament cover layer 122 , for example. With this configuration, an increase in the outer diameter of the medical suture thread 100 can be suppressed while the bendability of the entirety of the medical suture thread 100 is improved. Thus, favorable operability can be ensured. The inner-filament cover layer 112 may be formed thicker than the outer-filament cover layer 122 . With this configuration, a loss of the inner-filament cover layer 112 due to abrasion can be reduced. Moreover, the bendability can be maintained over a long period of time. In the above-described embodiment, the core thread 110 includes the multiple twisted ultrafine threads 111 . Specifically, in the configuration of the core thread 110 , two bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads 111 are twisted. However, in the configuration of the core thread 110 , three or more bundles may be twisted. The core thread 110 may be formed in such a manner that multiple bundles of multiple ultrafine threads 111 are braided. In addition, a configuration including multiple ultrafine threads 111 linearly arranged in parallel may be employed. The core thread 110 may include a single ultrafine thread 111 . In the above-described embodiment, the outer thread 120 is formed in such a manner that the multiple ultrafine threads 121 are braided. Specifically, the outer thread 120 is formed in such a manner that five bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads 121 are braided. However, the outer thread 120 may be formed in such a manner that four or less or six or more bundles are braided. The outer thread 120 may include multiple twisted bundles of multiple ultrafine threads 121 . In the above-described embodiment, in the configuration of the medical suture thread 100 , the outer thread 120 is formed outside the core thread 110 . However, it may only be required that the medical suture thread 100 includes a single thread having an assembly of one or multiple fibrous ultrafine threads. Thus, the medical suture thread 100 may include only one ultrafine thread 111 or one ultrafine thread 121 .

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT This invention was developed under federal funding through grant no. FA9550-15-10022 awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). The Government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is generally in the field of catalysts, particularly catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and ester carbonylation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Acetic acid (AA) is one of the most important bulk commodity chemicals with a worldwide production of more than 10 million tonnes per year, and is used as a precursor for the production of vinyl acetate, acetic anhydride, and acetic esters, among others (Haynes, A., Advances in Catalysis , Elsevier, 2010; Vol. 53, Chapter 1, 1-45). Monsanto commercialized an Rh-based homogeneous catalyst for the carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid, under reaction conditions of 180-220° C. and 2-4 MPa (Paulik, et al., Chem. Commun., 1968, 11, 1578). BP Chemicals developed the Cativa process, which uses an Ru-promoted Ir catalyst and is similar in process operation to the Monsanto process. Although both of these processes require methyl-iodide to participate in each catalytic turnover (Maitlis, P. M.; Haynes, A.; Sunley, G. J.; Howard, M. J., J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans., 1996, 11, 2187), and are operated in the liquid phase, the Cativa process is reported to exhibit higher catalytic activity at lower water content and produce less byproducts compared to the Monsanto process (Sunley, et al., Catal. Today, 2000, 58, 293). However, current methanol carbonylation processes require the separation of catalysts and water, in addition to the use of halides, which increases process costs and environmental concerns (Haynes, A., Top. Organomet. Chem., 2006, 18, 179; Ni, et al., Catal. Sci. Technol., 2017, 7, 4818). Current attempts to immobilize organometallic complexes on solid supports require the use of halides and water in the catalytic process, which minimizes the potential benefit of the immobilized catalysts (Howard, et al., Catal. Today, 1993, 18, 325; Hjortkjær, et al., Appl. Catal., 1990, 67, 269; U.S. Pat. No. 2,729,651 to Arnold, et al). There have been reports that halide-free, gas-phase methanol carbonylation to acetic acid can be achieved using zeolites, such as H-mordenite (H-MOR) (Fujimoto, et al., Chem. Lett., 1984, 13, 2047). In these systems, methanol adsorbs on Brønsted acid sites to form methoxy groups, which can react directly with gas phase CO to form an acylium cation that can be quenched by H 2 O to produce acetic acid (Stepanov, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 117, 3615; Luzgin, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118, 10890). Further promotion of reactivity can be achieved by using Cu-modified H-MOR (Cu-MOR), where CO adsorbed to Cu cations promotes the rate of CO insertion into methoxy species on nearby acid sites through a bifunctional mechanism (Zhou, et al., Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson., 2016, 80, 1). However, methoxy species on acidic sites can also react with gas phase methanol to produce dimethyl ether (DME) and Cu promotes carbonylation of dimethyl ether to produce methyl acetate (Blasco, et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2007, 46, 3938). As a result of these alternate reaction pathways, high selectivity to acetic acid requires process operation at high CO to methanol ratios (i.e., >50:1 molar ratio), which would necessitate the use of very large recycle streams in industrial processes (Ni, et al., Catal. Sci. Technol., 2017, 7, 4818). There remains a need for improved catalysts and methods for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation, particularly ones that are suitable for industrial scale use. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation. It is also an object of the present invention to provide reactors for use with improved catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation. It is another object of the present invention to provide methods of using catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Catalysts containing a support and a metal oxide are described herein. Methods of catalyzing carbonylation reactions (such as an alcohol carbonylation reaction and/or ester carbonylation reaction) using the catalysts are also described. The support is typically chemically inert and has a high surface area. The metal oxide typically contains a transition metal or a mixture of metals including a transition metal, such as rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, or a combination thereof. Typically, the metal forming the metal oxide is present in an amount of at least 0.1 wt % of the catalyst. For example, the metal forming the metal oxide is present in an amount between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, such as between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst. Typically, the metal oxide is mainly atomically dispersed on the surface of the support, as indicated by scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). For example, at least 10% of the metal oxide is atomically dispersed on the surface of the support. The methods of catalyzing carbonylation reactions typically include the step of exposing a mixture of one or more alcohols or one or more esters, and carbon monoxide to the catalyst, in a reactor. Typically, the one or more alcohols or one or more esters, and carbon monoxide are in the gas phase. Optionally, the methods include oxidizing the metal oxide with an oxidizing gas prior to exposing the reactants to the catalyst. Optionally, the methods include recycling a gas stream after the reactants are exposed to the catalyst.

FIG. 9 is a graph showing EXAFS of 5 wt % Re/SiO 2 after 1 h oxidation in 20% O 2 /He at 350° C. The magnitude and imaginary portion of the Fourier transformed EXAFS are represented by the solid and dashed lines, respectively, while the fit to the imaginary portion is shown in dotted line. The inset shows the model used to fit the EXAFS spectrum. FIGS. 10 A- 10 B are graphs showing production rate of methyl acetate ( FIG. 10 A ) and formaldehyde ( FIG. 10 B ) measured at 30 mbar methanol and 30 mbar CO (balance He) as a function of temperature on 1, 5, 10 and 20 wt. % Re/SiO 2 . There is no measurable formaldehyde formation at lower temperature. FIG. 11 is a graph showing NH 3 -TPD signals for SiO 2 , 1 wt. % Re/SiO 2 , 5 wt. % Re/SiO 2 , 20 wt. % Re/SiO 2 , and bulk Re 2 O 7 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1314-68-7) physically mixed with SiO 2 (the amount of Re 2 O 7 and SiO 2 were adjusted to provide 20 wt. % Re/SiO 2 ). All catalysts were pretreated in O 2 at 350° C. for 1 h. A mixture of 10% NH 3 /90% He was flown over the catalyst at 50° C. for 1 h. The TPD measurements were carried out in the range 50-350° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min under He. The peak at 100° C. represents the weak acid sites on SiO 2 and the 200-250° C. peak represents the acid sites created by ReOx species. FIG. 12 is a graph showing reaction rate for methanol carbonylation to acetic acid and dimethyl ether carbonylation to methyl acetate on 5 wt. % Re/SiO 2 from 240 to 280° C. under 30 mbar methanol or dimethyl ether and 30 mbar CO (balance He). FIGS. 13 A- 13 B are graphs showing acetic acid production rates as a function of methanol partial pressure ( FIG. 13 A ) and CO partial pressure ( FIG. 13 B ) over 10 wt % Re/SiO 2 and 20 wt % Re/SiO 2 . In both sets of experiments, the non-varied reactant partial pressure was held constant at 30 mbar. Before reactivity experiments, the catalyst was oxidized at 350° C. for 1 h. FIG. 14 is a graph showing comparison of in situ FTIR spectra for SiO 2 and 5 wt. % Re/SiO 2 . The 5 wt. % Re/SiO 2 sample was oxidized at 350° C. for 1 h before being exposed to 42, 105 and 150 mbar methanol with CO partial pressure the same as 30 mbar (balanced by He). The SiO 2 sample was oxidized at 350° C. for 1 h before being exposed to 150 mbar methanol with CO partial pressure as 30 mbar (balanced by He). The spectra were collected under methanol and CO. On SiO 2 , two strong bands at 2954 and 2854 cm −1 correspond to intact methanol on SiO 2 and a weak shoulder at 2996 cm −1 represents CH 3 O— on SiO 2 . FIG. 15 is a graph showing EXAFS spectra collected at 50° C. after 350° C. oxidation and 250° C. reaction condition for 5 wt % Re/SiO 2 . FIG. 16 is a graph showing magnitude of FT of the short and long Re—O scattering paths used in this work. For both paths, S o 2 =0.73, N=1, and σ 2 =0 in order to compare the relative magnitude of the two paths. There is a decreased peak intensity for longer Re—O (single) bonds compared to the shorter Re═O (double) bond. The decrease in intensity for the major peak for in-situ vs oxidized data (see FIG. 15 ) may be consistent with the proposed mechanism in which Re—O single bond coordination increases and Re═O double bond coordination decreases. FIGS. 17 A- 17 B are graphs showing DME production rates as a function of methanol partial pressure ( FIG. 17 A ) and CO partial pressure ( FIG. 17 B ) over 10 wt % Re/SiO 2 and 20 wt % Re/SiO 2 .

FIG. 18 A is a graph showing CO probe molecule FTIR spectra of Rh/SiO 2 and Rh/ReOx-SiO 2 catalysts. The catalysts were reduced at 250° C. under CO and spectra were collected under Ar. FIG. 18 B is a graph showing acetic acid production rate comparison between 10 wt % Re/SiO 2 and 0.2 wt Rh/10 wt % Re—SiO 2 . The catalysts were oxidized at 350° C. for 1 h before being exposed to the reaction condition (30 mbar methanol and CO). FIG. 19 is a graph showing dimethyl ether formation rate on 10 wt. % Re/SiO 2 and 0.2 wt. % Rh/10 wt. % Re—SiO 2 during methanol carbonylation from 200 to 280° C. under 30 mbar methanol and CO (balance He). FIG. 20 is a graph showing Arrhenius plots of the acetic acid formation rate on 10 wt. % Re/SiO 2 and 0.2 wt. % Rh/10 wt. % Re—SiO 2 during methanol carbonylation from 250 to 280° C. under 30 mbar methanol and CO (balance He). The error bars on 10 wt. % Re/SiO 2 represent the standard deviation calculated from 2 independently run reactions. The error on Eapp estimates is the 90% confidence interval of the fit.

Before catalytic performance measurement, the catalysts were pre-treated at 350° C. for 1 h. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I. Catalysts Catalysts described herein generally include a support and a metal oxide, and are generally suitable for use in heterogeneous reactions, such as catalytic carbonylation reactions, for example, alcohol carbonylation and ester carbonylation. The metal oxide is dispersed on the surface of the support. A. Support The support includes suitable support materials, it can be in a variety of suitable forms, and is has a high surface area. 1. Materials for Support The material for the support is generally chemically inert, i.e. non-acidic and non-basic, and is porous. The material for the support is typically not an acidic material or a material that can become acidic, such as zirconium dioxide. The material for the support is typically not a basic material, such as magnesium oxide. The chemically inert material for the support does not react with any of the reactants and products in the catalytic reaction for which it is selected for use. a. Chemically Inert Materials Examples of suitable chemically inert materials for the support include, but are not limited to, silicon dioxide and carbon-based materials. A carbon-based material generally refers to a material where the number of carbon atoms are at least 50% of the total number of atoms in the material. Examples of suitable carbon-based materials for the support include, but are not limited to, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon black, and graphene. b. Porosity Generally, the material for the support is a mesoporous material or a microporous material. In some embodiments, the material for the support is a mesoporous material and has an average pore diameter from 1 nm to 50 nm. For example, the material for the support is a mesoporous material and the mesoporous material has an average pore diameter of at least 1 nm, at least 2 nm, at least 3 nm, at least 4 nm, up to 50 nm, up to 40 nm, up to 30 nm, up to 10 nm, between 1 nm and 40 nm, between 1 nm and 30 nm, between 1 nm and 20 nm, between 1 nm and 15 nm, between 1 nm and 10 nm, or between 5 nm and 15 nm. For example, the material for the support can be mesoporous silicon dioxide nanoparticles with an average pore diameter between 5 nm and 15 nm, such as SBA-15 (Sigma-Aldrich). In other embodiments, the material for the support is a microporous material and has an average pore diameter up to 1 nm, such as from 0.4 nm to 1 nm. For example, the material for the support is a microporous material and the microporous material has an average pore diameter of up to 1 nm, up to 0.9 nm, up to 0.8 nm, up to 0.7 nm, at least 0.4 nm, at least 0.5 nm, between 0.4 nm and 1 nm, between 0.5 nm and 1 nm, between 0.4 nm and 0.9 nm, or between 0.4 nm and 0.8 nm. For example, the material for the support is microporous silicon dioxide (e.g. siliceous zeolites) with an average pore diameter between 0.4 nm and 1 nm. 2. Forms of the Support The support can be in a variety of suitable forms, such as a sheet, powder, particles, microparticles, and/or nanoparticles. For example, the support can be in the form of silicon dioxide nanoparticles or silicon microparticles. In some embodiments, the support can be in the form of a carbon sheet (e.g. graphene sheet), carbon powder, carbon particles, or carbon nanoparticles (e.g. carbon nanotubes). When the support is in the form of microparticles, the microparticles can have an average diameter up to 500 μm, up to 400 μm, up to 300 μm, up to 200 μm, up to 150 μm, up to 100 μm, up to 10 μm, or up to 5 μm. For example, the support can be silicon dioxide nanoparticles having an average diameter less than 150 μm. When the support is in the form of nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can have an average diameter up to 1 μm, up to 500 nm, up to 200 nm, up to 100 nm, up to 50 nm, up to 20 nm, up to 10 nm, or up to 5 nm. When the support is in the form of a carbon sheet, such as a graphene sheet, the sheet can have a dimension on the order of 900 μm, 800 μm, 700 μm, 600 μm, 500 μm, 400 μm, 300 μm, 200 μm, or 100 μm. 3. Surface Area The support is generally selected to have a high surface area. When calculating surface area of the support, any surface, including internal surfaces within the pores of the mesoporous material that the reactants are able to contact is typically included. Surface area of the support can be measured by techniques known in the art, for example, by nitrogen physisorption. Typically, the support has a surface area of at least 50 m 2 /g, at least 100 m 2 /g, at least 200 m 2 /g, at least 300 m 2 /g, at least 400 m 2 /g, at least 500 m 2 /g, up to 1000 m 2 /g, up to 900 m 2 /g, up to 800 m 2 /g, between 100 m 2 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, between 200 m 2 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, between 300 m 2 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, between 400 m 2 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, or between 500 m 2 /g and 1000 m 2 /g, such as about 700 m 2 /g. B. Metal Oxide The metal oxide can contain a single metal or is a mixture of metals. The metal oxide is dispersed on the surface of the support. The metal oxide may be atomically dispersed or form clusters on the surface of the support. The distribution and form of the metal oxide can be determined by any suitable method, for example X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), STEM such as high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM), and UV-vis (Ultraviolet-visible) spectroscopy or spectrophotometry. In some catalysts, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the metal oxide is atomically dispersed on the surface of the support with the remainder of the metal oxide being in the form of clusters, as determined using statistical analysis of metal oxide structures in STEM images. For example, about 90% of the metal oxide is atomically dispersed on the surface of the support, and about 10% of the metal oxide forms clusters on the surface of the support, as determined using statistical analysis of metal oxide structures in STEM images. 1. Metals and/or Mixture of Metals Typically, the metal or the mixture of metals is/contains a transition metal, such as an acidic early transition metal. For example, the metal oxide can contain a single metal (i.e. MOx), such as rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum. In some embodiments, the metal oxide contains rhenium. The metal oxide can contain a mixture of two or more metals, where at least one of the metals, and optionally both of the metals are rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum. Optionally, the metal oxide contains a mixture of metals, where a first metal in the mixture of metals is selected from rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, and a combination thereof, and a second metal in the mixture of metals that is different from the first metal. The second metal in the mixture of metals can be rhodium, iridium, palladium, or a combination thereof. For example, the metal oxide contains a mixture of two metals (i.e. M 2 -M 1 O x ), where the first metal is rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum and the second metal is rhodium, iridium, or palladium. For example, the metal oxide can contain a mixture of two metals and where the first metal is rhenium (Re) and the second metal is rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), or iridium (Ir). Optionally, the catalyst contains more than one metal oxide. Each of the metal oxides may contain a single metal or a mixture of metals. Any metal or mixture of metals described above may be used. Each of two or more metal oxides in the catalyst contains a metal that is different from the other. In some embodiments, at least one of the metal oxides contains a metal or a mixture of metals selected from the group consisting of rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, or a combination thereof. For example, the catalyst may contain three metal oxides, where the first metal oxide contains rhenium, the second metal oxide contains rhodium, and the third metal oxide contains a mixture of rhenium and rhodium. 2. Amount Generally, the amount of the one metal or the total amount of two or more metals forming the metal oxide is at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, up to 5 wt %, up to 10 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, up to 15 wt % of the catalyst, up to 14 wt % of the catalyst, up to 13 wt %, up to 12 wt %, up to 11 wt %, up to 10.5 wt %, up to 10.2 wt %, between 0.1 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.05 wt % and 10 wt %, between 0.05 wt % and 5 wt %, between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt %, between 0.1 wt % and 5 wt %, between 0.5 wt % and 10 wt %, between 0.5 wt % and 5 wt %, between 0.5 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst. The term “total amount of two or more metals” refers to the total weight of the two or more metals forming the metal oxide relative to the total weight of the catalyst. For example, the catalyst contains MOx (where M represents the metal) and the amount of M forming the MOx is present in an amount of at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, up to 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst. For example, the catalyst contains ReOx (e.g. ReO 4 ) and the amount of Re forming the ReOx is present in an amount of at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, up to 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst. For example, the catalyst contains a metal oxide formed from a mixture of two or more metals and the total amount of the two or more metals is present in an amount at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, up to 15 wt % of the catalyst, up to 14 wt % of the catalyst, up to 13 wt %, up to 12 wt %, up to 11 wt %, up to 10.5 wt %, up to 10.2 wt %, between 0.1 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 15 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 12 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10.5 wt % of the catalyst, such as about 10.2 wt % of the catalyst.

For example, the catalyst contains a metal oxide formed from a mixture of two metals (i.e. M 2 -M 1 O x ), where the amount of a first metal (i.e. M 1 ) forming the metal oxide can be at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, up to 10 wt % of the catalyst, in the range between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.5 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, between 2 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, or between 5 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst; and the amount of a second metal (i.e. M 2 ) forming the metal oxide can be at least 0.05 wt %, at least 0.1 wt %, at least 0.2 wt %, at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, up to 5 wt %, in the range between 0.05 wt % and 5 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.05 wt % and 2 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.05 wt % and 1 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.05 wt % and 0.5 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 5 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 2 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 1 wt % of the catalyst, or between 0.1 wt % and 0.5 wt % of the catalyst.

Optionally, the catalyst contains one metal oxide and the metal oxide is present in an amount of at least 0.1 wt % of the catalyst. For example, the metal oxide is present in an amount of at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 3 wt % of the catalyst, at least 5 wt % of the catalyst, at least 10 wt % of the catalyst, up to 30 wt % of the catalyst, up to 20 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 30 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 30 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 20 wt % of the catalyst, between 1 wt % and 20 wt % of the catalyst, between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, or between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst. For example, the metal oxide is present in an amount of between 0.1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst, such as between 1 wt % and 10 wt % of the catalyst.

For example, the disclosed catalyst may be prepared using the methods described in US 2016/0199814 by Bai, et al. II. Reactors The disclosed catalysts can be used in a variety of reactors, for example, a gas phase plug flow reactor. Generally, a gas phase plug flow reactor includes a reaction chamber, a catalyst bed inside the reaction chamber, a gas inlet, and a gas outlet. The disclosed catalyst may be packed in the catalyst bed. The catalyst bed is at a controlled temperature. Optionally, an inert plug is located at the top and/or the bottom of the catalyst bed to maintain the catalyst bed position. Exemplary materials that are suitable for the plug include, but are not limited to, quartz wool. The gas inlet and gas outlet are in fluid communication with the reaction chamber. Typically, the gas inlet and gas outlet are configured such that a gas fed into the gas inlet, flows into the reaction chamber, through the catalyst bed packed with catalysts, and out of the catalyst bed and through the gas outlet. Optionally prior to flowing through the catalyst bed and/or after flowing through the catalyst bed, the gas passes through a plug. Optionally, after flowing through the catalyst bed, a portion of the gas is recycled back through the reaction chamber. An exemplary gas phase plug flow reactor 100 is shown in FIG. 8 . The reactor 100 includes a reaction chamber 110 . A catalyst bed 120 is inside the reaction chamber 110 . Catalyst is packed in the catalyst bed 120 . Two plugs 130 a and 130 b are placed at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed 120 , respectively, to keep it in position. A gas inlet 140 is located at the top of the reaction chamber 110 . A gas outlet 150 is located at the bottom of the reaction chamber 110 . The gas inlet 140 and gas outlet 150 are in fluid communication with the reaction chamber 110 , such that a gas fed through the gas inlet 140 into the reaction chamber 110 , flows through the catalyst bed 120 , and is directed from the catalyst bed 120 to the gas outlet 150 . III. Methods of Using the Catalysts Generally, the catalysts can be used to catalyze carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and ester carbonylation. For example, the catalysts can be used to catalyze carbonylation of an alcohol to form its corresponding carboxylic acid, or, the catalyst can be used to catalyze carbonylation of an ester (e.g. methyl acetate) to form it corresponding anhydride (e.g. acetic anhydride). The catalytic reaction is typically a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. For example, the catalyst is solid phase and the reactants are in the liquid phase, gas phase, or both. Typically, the reaction is water-free and/or halide-free. A. Alcohol Carbonylation The catalysts can be used to catalyze an alcohol carbonylation reaction. The catalytic reaction is typically a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. For example, the catalyst is solid phase and the reactants are in liquid phase, gas phase, or both. Typically, the reaction is water-free and/or halide-free. Generally, the method for alcohol carbonylation includes step (i): exposing a mixture of one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide to one of the disclosed catalysts. The one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide are reactants, and typically, are in gas phase. As noted above, the support of the catalyst is inert and generally does not contain acidic and basic sites. The method of using the disclosed catalyst generally does not include a step of neutralizing the support prior to or during step (i). For example, the method generally does not include a step of treating the support with a basic or acidic agent, such as sodium or carbon dioxide, prior to or during step (i). 1. Contacting a Mixture of One or More Alcohols and Carbon Monoxide with the Catalyst Generally, a mixture of one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide is exposed to the catalyst by causing the one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide to flow through a catalyst bed packed with/containing at least one of the disclosed catalysts. a. Alcohols i. Length of Carbon Chain Typically, the one or more alcohols in the reactant mixture are C1-C20 alcohols, C1-C10 alcohols, or C1-C5 alcohols. The alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol, R—OH, where R is a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing 1-20 carbon atoms. The saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group can be linear, branched, or cyclic. The monohydric alcohol may be a primary alcohol, a secondary alcohol, or a tertiary alcohol. The primary alcohol can be an alcohol having a linear saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, such as a methanol, ethanol, propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, 1-decanol, 1-undecanol, 1-dodecanol, 1-tridecanol, 1-tetradecanol, 1-pentadecanol, 1-heptadecanol, 1-heptadecanol, 1-octadecanol, 1-nonadecanol, or 1-icosanol. For example, the alcohol is a methanol. In some embodiments, the alcohol is an ethanol or propanol. The alcohol can also be a primary alcohol having branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group, such as isobutyl alcohol. In some embodiments, the alcohol can be a secondary alcohol, such as 2-propanol, cyclohexanol. In some embodiments, the alcohol can be a tertiary alcohol, such as a 2-methyl-2-butanol. Optionally, the alcohol may contain more than one hydroxyl group, such as a diol, a triol, a tetraol, a pentol, a hexol, a heptol, etc. For example, the alcohol can be ethane-1,2-diol, propane-1,2-diol, propane-1,2,3-triol, butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol, pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol, hexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol, or heptane-1,2,3,4,5,6,7-heptol. ii. Corresponding Carboxylic Acid Generally, the one or more alcohols in the reactant mixture are converted to their corresponding carboxylic acids. A corresponding carboxylic acid is the carboxylic acid produced from the carbonylation of a given alcohol. Typically, an alcohol dehydrates into an alkoxy group at a dispersed site of metal oxide on the surface of the catalyst. Carbon monoxide attaches onto the alkoxy group at the surface, and produces a carboxylic acid, which is the corresponding carboxylic acid of the alcohol. An exemplary reaction scheme for methanol carbonylation is shown in Scheme 1 and FIG. 7 . For example, methanol dehydrates into methoxy group at a dispersed site of metal oxide (e.g. rhenium oxide). Carbon monoxide attaches onto the surface methoxy group and produces acetic acid, which is the corresponding carboxylic acid of methanol. Exemplary alcohols and their corresponding carboxylic acids are listed in Table 1 below.

Alcohol to Carbon Monoxide Ratio Typically, the molar ratio of the carbon monoxide and one or more alcohols in the reactant mixture is between about 0.01 and about 100. For example, the molar ratio of the total of one or more alcohols to carbon monoxide can be at least 0.05, at least 0.1, at least 0.5, at least 1, at least 2, at least 5, up to 50, up to 40, up to 30, up to 20, up to 10, between 0.1 and 50, between 0.1 and 40, between 0.1 and 30, between 0.1 and 20, between 0.1 and 10, for example, 1. The term “total of one or more alcohols” refers to the total mole of the one or more alcohols relative to the mole of carbon monoxide. b. Reaction Conditions Typically, the mixture of one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide is exposed to the catalyst by causing the one or more alcohols and carbon monoxide to flow through a catalyst bed packed containing the disclosed catalyst at a controlled temperature between 100° C. and 350° C. and a pressure between 0 bar and 50 bar. The period of time that the reactant mixture is exposed to the catalyst depends on the flow rate of the reactant mixture and the geometry of the catalyst bed. i.

Characteristics of Catalytic Reaction Alcohol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts can be characterized by single-pass conversion, production rate, selectivity, and/or stability. a. Single-Pass Conversion The catalysts described herein can be used to increase the single-pass conversion of a given reactor relative to a catalyst containing a metal oxide dispersed on the surface of an acidic support (e.g., zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)) or a basic support (e.g., magnesium oxide (MgO)) at a temperature in the range of 100° C. to 350° C. and a pressure from 0 bar to 50 bar, such as up to 1 bar. For example, an alcohol flowing through a catalyst bed packed with Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, which contains sodium that neutralizes the ZrO2 support, was shown to have a single pass conversion of about 0.5% at a temperature of 300° C. and a pressure of 1 bar. Similarly, an alcohol flowing through a catalyst bed packed with Re/MgO catalyst, was shown to have a single pass conversion of about 0.2% at a temperature of 245° C. and a pressure of 1 bar. In contrast, when fed into a reactor containing one or more of the catalysts disclosed herein, the alcohol in the reactant mixture can have a single pass conversion of 10% or higher, such as 20% or higher, 30% or higher, 40% or higher, 50% or higher, or 60% or higher, optionally from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 50%, or from 30% to 50%, optionally from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 65%, or from 50% to 60%. The single-pass conversion for a given reactant can be calculated using Formula (1): Single-pass conversion=(reactant reactor feed −reactant reactor outlet )/(reactant reactor feed )×100 Generally, an alcohol carbonylation reaction conducted in a reactor containing one or more of the catalysts disclosed herein has a single-pass conversion of at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, or at least 60% for the alcohol in the reactant mixture. For example, an alcohol flowing through a catalyst bed packed with the disclosed catalysts can have a single-pass conversion of at least 50% at a temperature between 200° C. and 300° C. and a pressure up to 1 bar. b. Production Rate The production rate in alcohol carbonylation reactions refers to the amount of corresponding carboxylic acid generated in a given period of time. The production rate may increase with an increase in the temperature at which the reaction is carried out. The production rate in an alcohol carboynlation reaction is at least substantially equivalent to typical production rates for industrial processes involving liquid phase halogen alcohol carbonylation reactions, which typically have a production rate of 1.5 mmol dm −3 s −1 (Maths, et al., Dalton Trans., 1996, 2187-2196). Comparison of the acetic acid production rate in an alcohol carbonylation reaction using the disclosed catalysts and exemplary known heterogamous and homogeneous systems is shown in Table 4. Generally, alcohol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts has a production rate of at least 0.007 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.01 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.02 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.03 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.04 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.05 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.1 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.15 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.16 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.17 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.18 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.19 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , or at least 0.2 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at a reaction temperature ranging from 100° C. to 350° C. and a pressure of 0 bar and 50 bar. In some embodiments, alcohol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts has a production rate of at least 0.007 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.01 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.02 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.03 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.04 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.05 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.1 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.15 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.16 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.17 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.18 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at least 0.19 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , or at least 0.2 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , at a reaction temperature ranging from 200° C. to 350° C., 200° C. to 300° C., or 250° C. to 300° C. and a pressure up to 1 bar. For example, the alcohol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts has a production rate of at least 0.17 mmol s −1 g metal −1 , such as about 0.2 mmol s −1 g metal −1 (about 1.8 mmol dm −3 s −1 ), at a reaction temperature ranging from 200° C. to 350° C., 200° C. to 300° C., or 250° C. to 300° C. and a pressure of up to 50 bar, up to 10 bar, or up to 1 bar in gas phase and halide-free alcohol carbonylation reactions. Optionally, a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a mixture of metals, such as a mixture of rhenium and rhodium, a mixture of rhenium and palladium, or a mixture of rhenium and iridium, can increase the corresponding carboxylic acid production rate by at least 2 times, at least 5 times, or at least an order of magnitude when compared with the carboxylic acid production rate using a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a single metal, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. For example, a catalyst containing Rh—Re-Ox can increase the corresponding carboxylic acid production rate by at least an order of magnitude compared with a catalyst containing ReOx only, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. c. Selectivity The alcohol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts may produce more than one product. For example, methanol carbonylation using the disclosed catalysts may produce acetic acid, and byproducts, such as dimethyl ether, methyl acetate, and/or formaldehyde. For example, dimethyl ether may be formed from methanol reacting with surface methoxy group and/or combination of two surface methoxy groups. Dimethyl ether may react with surface acetyl moiety, which is produced by CO insertion onto surface methyoxy group, to form methyl acetate. Formaldehyde may be formed from methoxy dehydration. Typically, the production rate of a corresponding carboxylic acid is at least 2 times, at least 5 times, at least 10 times, at least 20 times, at least 30 times, at least 40 times, at least 45 times, at least 50 times, at least 55 times, at least 60 times, at least 65 times, at least 70 times, at least 75 times, or at least 80 times higher than the production rate of a byproduct under the same reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and flow rate. The catalyst selectivity in alcohol carbonylation reactions generally refers to the percentage of alcohol that is converted into the corresponding carboxylic acid. Typically, the catalyst selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid in an alcohol carbonylation is high, such as at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, at a reaction temperature ranging from 100° C. to 350° C. and a pressure of 0 bar and 50 bar. In some embodiments, the catalyst selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid in an alcohol carbonylation is at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90%, at a reaction temperature ranging from 200° C. to 350° C., 200° C. to 300° C., or 250° C. to 300° C. and a pressure up to 1 bar. For example, the selectivity to acetic acid in a methanol carbonylation using the disclosed catalyst is at least 80%, at least 85%, or at least 90%, such as at least 93% or 95%, at a reaction temperature ranging from 200° C. to 350° C., 200° C. to 300° C., or 250° C. to 300° C. and a pressure of up to 50 bar, up to 10 bar, or up to 1 bar in gas phase and halide-free alcohol carbonylation reactions. Optionally, a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a mixture of metals, such as a mixture of rhenium and rhodium, a mixture of rhenium and palladium, or a mixture of rhenium and iridium, can increase the selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid by at least 0.2%, at least 0.5%, at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 5%, up to 10%, from 0.2% to 10%, from 0.5% to 10%, from 1% to 10%, from 2% to 10%, or from 5% to 10%, when compared with the selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid using a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a single metal, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. For example, a catalyst containing Rh—Re-Ox can increase the selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid by at least 0.2%, at least 0.5%, at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 5%, up to 10%, from 0.2% to 10%, from 0.5% to 10%, from 1% to 10%, from 2% to 10%, or from 5% to 10%, compared with a catalyst containing ReOx only, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. Optionally, a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a mixture of metals, such as a mixture of rhenium and rhodium, a mixture of rhenium and palladium, or a mixture of rhenium and iridium, can increase the corresponding carboxylic acid production rate by at least 2 times, at least 5 times, or at least an order of magnitude and increase the selectivity for producing the carboxylic acid by at least 0.2%, at least 0.5%, or at least 1% when compared with the carboxylic acid production rate using a catalyst containing a metal oxide formed from a single metal, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. For example, a catalyst containing Rh—Re-Ox can increase the corresponding carboxylic acid production rate by at least an order of magnitude and increase the selectivity for producing the corresponding carboxylic acid by at least 0.2%, at least 0.5%, at least 1%, at least 2%, at least 5%, up to 10%, from 0.2% to 10%, from 0.5% to 10%, from 1% to 10%, from 2% to 10%, or from 5% to 10%, compared with a catalyst containing ReOx only, for the same alcohol carbonylation reaction. d. Stability Catalyst stability generally refers to the catalyst's performance under reaction conditions without any observable decrease in the reactivity or selectivity of the catalyst.

The present invention will be further understood by reference to the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Example 1. Synthesis and Structure Characterization of ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Materials and Methods ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Synthesis ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by introducing water-soluble organics to induce complex formation with metal ions. Triethanolamine (TEA) was chosen, because amino groups can coordinate with metal and the hydroxyl group can coordinate with the support leading to anchoring of the metal to the support surface. Mesoporous SBA-15 with 4 nm pore size (Sigma-Aldrich, 7631-86-9) were used as the support and perrhenic acid solution (HReO 4 solution) (Sigma-Aldrich, 75-80 wt % in H 2 O) were used as the precursor. To synthesize 1% Re in the form of ReOx onto 500 mg SBA-15, 5 mg Re (0.02 mmol) is needed, which corresponds to 0.02 mmol HReO 4 (6.75 mg HReO4) precursor. Accordingly, a total of 8.4 mg HReO 4 solution was used. The amount of HReO 4 solution needed to prepare 5%, 10%, or 20% Re weight loading in the ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst was calculated following the above calculation. The support was chosen based on its high surface area and inertness. For the deposition of ReO x species, appropriate amounts of Re precursor were dissolved in 10 mL of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water (JT4218-3, J. T. Baker) and the desired amounts of TEA with 8 times molar of Re was added into the solution under magnetic stirring for 30 min. The addition of 8:1 molar ratio of TEA is to promote Re dispersion. The Re precursor solution was mixed with the 100 mL SBA-15 support suspension under magnetic stirring with syringe pump under 5 mL/hr injection speed. After mixing for 12 hours at room temperature, the solution was dried at 80° C. by rotary evaporator. Before the catalyst characterization and reactivity, the sample was calcined at 450° C. for 4 hours under dry air. ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Characterization Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were used to characterize the structure of ReO x on SBA-15. The spectrums were obtained using dehydrated MgO as a reference with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV-Vis spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Samples were lightly ground using a mortar and a pestle and dehydrated at 350° C. for 1 hour in flowing dry air and reaction conditions (30 mbar methanol and 30 mbar CO at 250° C.). Calculation of the onset of photon absorption induced by ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) was described previously (Lwin, et al., ACS Catal., 2015, 5 (3), 1432-1444; Barton, et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 1999, 103, 630-640). For comparison, the LMCT onsets for KReO 4 and Re 2 O 7 were obtained, representing isolated ReO 4 and bulk ReOx species, respectively. The bandgap energy (Eg) of reference compounds representing isolated and oligomeric Re x O y , such as KReO 4 and Re 2 O 7 , were collected for comparison. High-Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) Besides UV-Vis, 10-20 scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images on each sample after calcination at 450° C. for 4 hour was also collected. Atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging was performed on a JEOL Grand ARM300CF microscope with double aberration correctors at 300 kV. Images were collected after ex-situ calcination of samples at 450° C. using a convergence semiangle of 22 mrad, and inner- and outercollection angles of 83 and 165 mrad, respectively. A beam current of 11 pA was used with pixel time of 4 μs. X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) XAS at the Re L3 edge (10535 eV) was executed on beamlines 4-1 and 9-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at the SLAC National Laboratory using a Si(220) double crystal monochromator. Spectra of Re reference compounds were collected by pressing finely ground powders into self-supporting pellets, while Re metal powder was smeared as a thin film on Kapton tape. In a typical experiment, 30 mg of catalyst was crushed, sieved (80-120 mesh), and loaded into a 1 cm catalyst bed in a 3 mm quartz tube flow-through reactor held perpendicular to the X-ray source (Hoffman, et al., J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2018, 25 (6), 1673-1682). Samples were diluted with mesoporous silica (MCM-41) to have an absorption length of 2.0 with a fractional absorbance of Re of about 0.2. A W foil was scanned simultaneously for energy calibration. In-situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements, consisting of 9-16 scans, were collected at 50° C. following exposure to oxidizing (20% O 2 /He, 350° C., 1 h) or reaction conditions (150 mbar methanol and 200 mbar CO in He, 250° C., 1 h). The raw data were processed using the Athena interface of Demeter software package (Ravel, et al., J. Synchrotron Radiat., 2005, 12 (4), 537-541). Spectra were energy calibrated, merged, and normalized. The EXAFS were extracted in k-space and Fourier transformed using the k 2 -weighted EXAFS function (k=3.9-14) to amplify oscillations at high k-values. EXAFS fitting was carried out over the R range (1-2.2 Å) taking into account k 1 -, k 2 -, and k 3 -weighting using the Artemis interface of Demeter. Phase shifts and amplitude for relevant backscattering paths were calculated using FEFF6 (Rehr, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 1992, 69 (23), 3397-3400). S o 2 was determined to be 0.73±0.04 by fitting the Re metal standard (data not shown). A multiple data set fit was performed for the 5, 10, and 20 wt % Re loading samples simultaneously to minimize errors. Spectra were fit with two Re—O scattering paths derived from the crystal structure of tetrahedral Re in Re 2 O 7 (mp-1016092). Coordination numbers to the short (double bonded) Re═O scattering path and long (single bonded) Re—O scattering path were fixed at 3 and 1, respectively, consistent with previous EXAFS treatment of similar samples, and the +7 Re oxidation state was inferred from X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements (Vicente, et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2011, 115 (18), 9012-9024; Bare, et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2011, 115 (13), 5740-5755). Temperature-Programmed Desorption of Ammonia (NH3-TPD) NH 3 -TPD measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 instrument. In a typical experiment, 0.15 g of catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped, flow-thru, quartz sample tube. Prior to measurements, the catalyst was pretreated in O 2 (30 cm 3 /min) at 350° C. for 1 h to remove adsorbed water. A mixture of 10% NH 3 /90% helium was flown over the catalyst (30 cm 3 /min) at 50° C. for 1 h. Then the sample was flushed with pure helium (30 cm 3 /min) at 50° C. for 1 h. The TPD measurements were carried out in the range 100-350° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min NH 3 concentration in the effluent was monitored with a gold-plated filament thermal conductivity detector. The amount of desorbed NH3 was determined based on the calibrated area under the desorption curve. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) High-resolution XPS measurements were performed on an Escalab Xi+(Thermo-Fisher) XPS microprobe equipped with a monochromatic Al anode Xray source. The pressure in the XPS chamber was maintained below 1×10 −9 Torr during the acquisition process. XPS measurements were performed using the vacuum/inert transfer vessel with the use of glovebox for the sample preparation and transfer to enable analysis after pretreatment without exposure to atmosphere. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Catalysts were loaded into a Harrick Praying Mantis reaction chamber with ZnSe windows mounted inside a Thermo Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance adapter set inside a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer. All gases were passed across an isopropyl alcohol/liquid nitrogen cold trap and a glass trap filled with Drierite desiccant to remove trace moisture. Before characterization, catalysts were pretreated via in situ oxidation at 350° C. for 1 h under O 2 flow, and a background spectrum was taken before CO and methanol introduction. The CO partial pressure was kept as 30 mbar, and methanol partial pressures were chosen as 42, 105, and 150 mbar with helium as a carrier gas. The spectra were collected under methanol and CO. In all measurements, spectra were obtained by averaging 32 sequentially collected scans at a resolution of 4 cm −1 . Results To provide sample-averaged information on the ReOx structure without influence of the elctron beam, UV-vis and XAS were performed. In-situ UV-vis spectroscopy measurements of the edge energy (Eg) for the LMCT electronic transition were executed under an oxidative environment, and reaction conditions. Eg provides useful information regarding the electronic structure of the ReOx species, which is sensitive to the ReOx domain size and structure (moving from discrete electronic structure of monomeric species to bands existing in bulk structures). The Eg of ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts after dehydration was measured with in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to determine the domain size of ReO x species, as shown in FIG. 1 . The Eg reflects the electronic structure determined by local environments such as the level of distortion, number of nearest polyhedral neighbors, and bonds between each of those neighbors (Barton, D. G., et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 103(4):630-640 (1999) Lwin, S. et al., ACS Catal., 5:1432-1444 (2015)). As seen in FIG. 1 , the bandgap energies of KReO 4 and Re 2 O 7 , representing isolated and oligomeric Re oxide species, were 4.1 and 2.8 eV, respectively, demonstrating that the bandgap energy depends on the ReO x domain size. The samples were treated under two conditions: oxidation at 350° C. for 1 h (circles in FIG. 1 ) and oxidation at 350° C. for 1 h and then reduction at 250° C. for 1 h which is similar with reaction conditions (squares in FIG. 1 ). The reaction was at 250° C. Under both conditions, the Ep shows a similar trends. The bandgap energy of ReO x /SBA-15 with Re weight loading of 1% and 5% was 4.45 eV, demonstrating that under these weight loadings, ReO x resided as isolated species on SBA-15. When the Re weight loading of the ReO x /SBA-15 catalyst is 10%, the sample showed a lower bandgap energy at 4.3 eV, which demonstrates that ReO x is mainly isolated dispersed, but there is some Re cluster formation. The bandgap energy of ReO x /SBA-15 where the Re weight loading is 20% was below 4.1 eV, demonstrating that at this weight loading, ReO x structure is mainly in a cluster. A comparison of the Eg values to those of control samples, dispersed (KReO 4 , Eg=4.1 eV) species, and bulk (Re 2 O 7 , Eg=2.8 eV) ReOx species, shows that at lower Re weight loadings (1, 5, and 10 wt %), ReOx exists predominantly in the form of atomically dispersed species, while ReOx clusters are present at higher Re weight loadings and their size increases with increasing Re loading. The similar Eg following calcination and reaction conditions shows that ReOx domains remain stable under reaction conditions. This is in contrast to a previous report in which ReOx on SiO 2 was unstable after 2 h during 2-butanol dehydration (She, et al., ACS Catal., 2012, 2 (6), 1020-1026), demonstrating that the use of TEA during synthesis promotes the stability of a highly dispersed ReOx species on SiO 2 . The ReO x structures at different weight loading are also supported by HAADF-STEM images of the calcined (450° C., dry air) samples. In HAADF-STEM, the higher atomic number of Re as compared to Si allows identification of Re domains via increased scattering of the electron beam. While atomically dispersed ReOx species were primarily observed for the 5 wt % Re sample, an increase in the density and existence of ReOx clusters was observed with increasing Re loading to 10 and 20 wt %. The fraction of ReOx clusters in each sample is likely an over estimation of the as-prepared state due to the electron beam induced coalescense during image acquisition (Mishra, et al., MRS Bull., 2017, 42 (9), 644-652). Previous analysis of WOx species on ZrOx noted that analysis by STEM imaging showed higher concentrations of WOx clusters than atomically dispersed species as compared to correlated spectrscopic measurements (Zhou, et al., Nat. Chem., 2009, 1 (9), 722-728). Accordingly, the STEM results show that ReO x of 5% Re weight loading was isolated dispersed on SBA-15 (data not shown). For the ReO x /SBA-15 catalyst where the Re weight loading is 10%, some ReO x clusters form, and for the ReO x /SBA-15 catalyst where the Re weight loading is 20%, mainly ReO x clusters were present. XAS was used to further characterize the oxidation state and structure of ReOx species on the support. ReOx/SBA-15 samples of various Re weight loadings showed nearly identical XANES spectra following oxidation (data not shown), with edge energies correlating to Re in +7 oxidation state, which was also confirmed by XPS (data not shown). EXAFS spectra were fit with a proposed ReO 4 model that is consistent with the Re +7 oxidation state observed from XANES, in which Re makes a single bond to the support via oxygen (Re—O 1.77±0.04 Å), and is coordinated to three additional Re═O double bonds (Re—O 1.69±0.01 Å). The fit yielded a good match to the measured EXAFS spectrum for the 5 wt % Re sample (see FIG. 9 ). The EXAFS data and fit (data not shown) are also in agreement with previously reported structures of atomically dispersed ReO 4 (Vicente, et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2011, 115 (18), 9012-9024; Bare, et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2011, 115 (13), 5740-5755). Notably, the EXAFS data for the 5, 10, and 20 wt % Re samples did not vary considerably (data not shown), showing that this sample averaged technique may not be able to unambiguously identify small, subnanometer ReOx clusters within a sample containing atomically dispersed ReO 4 species (Resasco, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2020, 142 (1), 169-184). This is not unsuspected, as even bulk crystalline oligomeric Re species (Re 2 O 7 ) show Re—O—Re scattering at long bond lengths (data not shown), which is thus more sensitive to destructive interference from competing multiple scattering paths. Therefore, EXAFS likely, in contrast to STEM, underestimates the existence of ReOx clusters present. On the basis of a combination of STEM, UV-vis and XAS, it was concluded that ReOx was primarily atomically dispersed as ReO 4 species for 1 and 5 wt % Re, a mix of atomically dispersed ReO 4 and small ReOx clusters for 10 wt % Re, and primarily in the form of ReOx clusters for 20 wt % Re. Example 2. The ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Catalyze Methanol Carbonylation to Acetic Acid at a High Production Rate and Selectivity Materials and Methods The catalytic activity for methanol carbonylation was evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz reactor in the temperature range of 220-280° C. operating at atmospheric pressure. All gas flows were controlled by mass flow controllers (Teledyne Hastings) and an in-line bubbler was used to deliver gas phase methanol (Fisher Scientific, HPLC Grade, LOT: 177964) to the catalyst. Helium (Airgas, UHP, 99.999%) was used to bubble methanol and used as a diluent to control the methanol partial pressure. The reaction effluent was quantified with online mass spectrometry (HALO 201, Hiden Analytical Inc.). The following m/z values were used to detect each product: m/z=28 for CO, m/z=31 for MeOH, m/z=45 for dimethyl ether, m/z=60 for acetic acid, and m/z=74 for methyl acetate. The concentrations were calibrated to the signal intensity at each mass and Helium was used as an internal standard. The mass spec results were compared to calibrated analysis via gas chromatography, which showed quantitative agreement and the ability to close mass balances within ˜5% under all explored conditions. Prior to reactivity measurements, catalysts were treated by oxidation at 350° C. for 1 hour with pure O 2 at 50 mL min −1 , followed by measurements at varying temperatures. The system was maintained for two hours at each temperature to ensure steady state was achieved. Different ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts were tested with 1, 5, 10, and 20 wt % Re weight loading. During kinetic measurements, the total Re weight loading in the reactor was kept constant by using different weights of catalysts and diluent SBA-15. Additionally, SiO 2 gel was added to minimize the pressure drop (Table 2). For the measurement of different Re weight loading, 100 mg 1% ReO x /SBA-15 catalyst was diluted in 400 mg SiO 2 ; 20 mg 5% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 400 mg balanced with 80 mg SBA-15; 10 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 400 mg SiO 2 with 90 mg SBA-15; 5 mg 20% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 400 mg SiO 2 with 95 mg SBA-15. The percentage (i.e. 1%, 5%, 10% or 20%) refers to the weight loading of Re in each ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst (weight of Re relative to the weight of the catalyst). For example, 1% ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst (also referred herein as “1 wt % ReOx/SBA-15”) refers to a ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst where 1 wt % Re is present in the ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst. The ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts are also referred to herein as “Re—SiO 2 ” or “Re/SiO 2 ”. TABLE 2 The amount of catalysts used for methanol carbonylation reactivity measurement with different Re weight loadings.

For different weights of 10% ReO x /SBA-15 measurement, 30 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 catalyst was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 balanced with 270 mg SBA-15; 60 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 with 240 mg SBA-15; 90 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 with 210 mg SBA-15; 180 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 with 120 mg SBA-15; 300 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 ; 600 mg 10% ReO x /SBA-15 was diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 . Again, the percentage (i.e. 10%) refers to the weight loading of Re in each ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst (weight of Re relative to the weight of the catalyst). For example, 10% ReO x /SBA-15 (also referred herein as 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15) catalyst refers to a ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst where 10 wt % Re is present in the ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst. TABLE 3 The amount of catalysts used to promote methanol conversion during methanol carbonylation reaction with 10 wt. % ReOx/SBA-15.

Results Based on the UV-vis, STEM, and XAS results described above, the structure of ReO x on 1%, 5% and 10% Re weight loading on ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts are mainly isolated species whereas 20% Re weight loading on ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts are mainly clustered. As noted above, ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts having 1%, 5%, 10%, or 20% Re weight loadings are also referred herein as 1% ReOx/SBA-15 (or “1 wt % ReOx/SBA-15), 5% ReOx/SBA-15 (or “5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15), 10% ReOx/SBA-15 (or “10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15), or 20% ReOx/SBA-15 (or “20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15), respectively. The influence of ReO x structure on methanol carbonylation reactivity and selectivity was examined on these samples by comparing reactivity as a function of Re weight loading. Bulk Re 2 O 7 was also used to calibrate the reactivity of extended ReOx domains. Catalysts were pre-oxidized at 350° C. in O 2 and then exposed to a gas mixture of methanol and CO at a molar ratio of 1:1 for reactivity measurements (at 30 mbar of each) with a balance of helium at atmospheric pressure. The reaction was executed in the kinetically limited regime by keeping the methanol conversion below 10%. AA production rate for 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 measured at 280° C. and 30 mbar methanol and CO (balance He) was plotted as a function of the square root of the superficial velocity (data not shown). The production rates were observed to be independent of the superficial velocity showing a lack of mass transfer limitations. A superficial velocity of 100 cm 3 min −1 (20 cm 3 min −1 of He to purge methanol and 30 cm 3 min −1 of 10% CO/He with 50 cm 3 min −1 of He) was chosen for all kinetic experiments. In the temperature range of 220 to 280° C., the detectable products are acetic acid (AA), dimethyl ether (DME), methyl acetate (MA) and formaldehyde. ReO x will promote acidity of SBA-15 support (Liu, S., et al., ChemSusChem, 11:1446-1454 (2018)), so methanol could dehydrate into methoxy group on the acidic ReO x sites (Jehng, J.-M., et al., Catal. Today, 28:335-350 (1996)). The mechanism for AA formation during methanol carbonylation is that gas phase CO attacks a surface methoxy group at ReO x acidic sites and produces AA with ReO x sites restoring (Boronat, M., et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 13:2603-2612 (2011)). Two possible reaction pathways for DME formation are gas phase methanol reaction with surface methoxy groups, i.e. the dissociative mechanism (Corma, A., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 130:16316-16323 (2008)), and the combination of two surface methoxy groups that produce DME, i.e. the associative mechanism (Akarmazyan, S. S., et al., Appl. Catal. B Environ., 145:136-148 (2014); Qi, J. & Christopher, P., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 58:12632-12641 (2019)). DME can further react with surface acetyl moiety which is produced after CO insert onto surface methoxy to yield MA (Blasco, T. et al., Angew. Chemie - Int. Ed., 46:3938-3941 (2007); Cheung, P., et al., Angew. Chemie - Int. Ed., 45:1617-1620 (2006)). Formaldehyde formed from methoxy group dehydration (Tsoncheva, T., et al., J. Mol. Catal. A Chem., 225:245-251 (2005); Tsoncheva, T., et al., Can. J. Chem., 85:118-123 (2007)) was also detected. The production rates of AA and DME as a function of Re weight loading are shown in FIGS. 2 A- 2 B . All the production rates are based on the weight of Re. The results for MA and formaldehyde production rates are shown in FIGS. 10 A- 10 B . The bare SBA-15 support showed no measurable reactivity under these conditions. The methanol conversions in these measurements were kept below 5%. Both the 1% and 5% ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts present similar AA and DME production rates over the entire explored temperature range from 220 to 280° C. The AA production rate increases from 0.0001 to 0.038 mmol s −1 g Re −1 and DME production rate increases from 0.000065 to 0.0005 mmol s −1 g Re −1 with the increase of temperature from 220 to 280° C. (see FIGS. 2 A- 2 B ). For 1 and 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts, the AA and DME production rates were indistinguishable, showing 0.038 and 0.0005 mmol s −1 g Re −1 , respectively, at 280° C. As discussed above, the UV-vis and STEM results show that under these two weight loadings, ReO x structure on the SBA-15 support is isolated. Therefore, the methoxy groups formed from methanol dehydration on ReO x are also isolated, which inhibits DME formation. The only pathway for DME formation is through surface methoxy groups reacting with gas phase methanol. AA is formed from gas phase CO reacting with surface methoxy groups. For the ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts containing 10% Re weight loading on SBA-15, the AA production rate decreased to 0.0285 mmol s −1 g Re −1 at 280° C. and the DME production increased to 0.0006 mmol s −1 g Re −1 . The UV-vis analysis and STEM results demonstrate that the dominant structure of ReO x on 10% ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts is isolated dispersed, with some clustering. The increase of DME production rate demonstrates that when ReO x clusters exist, DME is formed not only from gas phase methanol reacting with surface methoxy, but also from combination of two surface methoxy groups. When the Re weight loading goes up to 20%, ReO x is primarily in the form of clusters on the SBA-15 support. The results show that under 20% weight loading, DME becomes the major product (see FIGS. 2 A- 2 B ). In the entire temperature range, the production rate of DME increases from 0.00002 to 0.02 mmol s −1 g Re −1 , which is more than 30 times higher than those under 1%, 5%, and 10% Re weight loadings. In addition, the AA production rate decreases to 0.007 mmol s −1 g Re −1 at 280° C. These results show that the primary reaction pathway on ReO x clusters is DME formation, and the mechanism for the DME formation includes both gas phase methanol attacking surface methoxy groups and combination of two surface methoxy groups. Also, the combination of two surface methoxy groups pathway shows lower energy barrier than gas phase attacking surface methoxy groups pathway. Therefore, increasing the Re loading to 20 wt % resulted in a 30-fold increase in the DME production rate at 280° C., while the AA production rate decreased by 5-fold compared to that of the 1 and 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15. Compared to the 20 wt % Re sample at 280° C., bulk Re 2 O 7 showed a DME production rate of only 2-fold higher and a 50% lower AA production rate. The similar reactivity of 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 and Re 2 O 7 , and their stark difference to the behavior of samples with 10 wt % Re or less, substantiate the use of Re weight loading variation for comparing the behavior of atomically dispersed ReO 4 and ReOx clusters. The measured apparent activation energies (Eapp) for AA and DME formation were similar for 1 and 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, showing Eapp of ˜130±30 kJ/mol and ˜100±40 kJ/mol for AA and DME formation, respectively. On 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, the Eapp for AA and DME formation were 155±20 and 112±28 kJ/mol, respectively. The slight deviation of the Eapp on 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 from 1 and 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, demonstrates relatively consistent active site distributions with a small increase in ReOx cluster formation at the higher weight loading, in agreement with inferences from catalyst characterization. On the 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, the Eapp for AA and DME were much higher, 259±64 and 257±9 kJ/mol, respectively. Bulk Re 2 O 7 exhibited Eapp of 272±33 and 273±32 kJ/mol for the formation of AA and DME, respectively, which are statistically similar to the 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 sample. There is some apparent deviation from Arrhenius like behavior at lower temperatures. This likely arises from the low analytical signals at these temperatures rather than a true deviation from exponential behavior. Differences in the measured Eapp for AA and DME formation over atomically dispersed ReO 4 versus ReOx clusters on SiO 2 and bulk Re 2 O 7 are derived from differences in acidity, as measured by NH 3 temperature-programmed desorption shown in FIG. 11 structure. This demonstrates that ReOx domain size dictates acid strength. The product formation rates and Eapp on the 1, 5, and 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts provide evidence that a consistent active site exists with a close to linear relationship between site density and reactivity. The reactivity results here show that either the majority of sites on ReOx/SBA-15 are active, or the same fraction of active sites are produced for different weight loadings (Chauvin, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1992, 6, 462-464). FIG. 3 shows the measured selectivity for AA production in the range of 220-280° C., where samples at lower weight loadings (1%, 5% and 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15) exhibit an AA selectivity of ˜93% at >250° C., whereas 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 and bulk Re 2 O 7 exhibited AA selectivity <20% across all temperatures. Note that at above 280° C., a significant increase in the rates of byproduct formation were observed, resulting in a decrease in AA selectivity. On the basis of the characterization and methanol carbonylation reactivity results, it is concluded that atomically dispersed ReO 4 species on SiO 2 are selective for AA formation, whereas ReOx clusters and bulk Re 2 O 7 with stronger acid sites primarily drive DME production. This demonstrates that communicating acidic sites that exist on the surface of ReOx clusters facilitate the rate of methanol coupling to DME. The DME carbonylation reaction was tested on 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 using 30 mbar DME and 30 mbar CO in the feed (see FIG. 12 ). The DME carbonylation reaction to MA proceeded at a rate 12 times higher than that of methanol carbonylation to AA under identical conditions. This highlights the role of minimizing DME formation pathways for obtaining high selectivity to AA. Water, which is a product during DME formation, may compete with other reaction intermediates at Lewis acid sites and may poison active sites that contribute to the production of AA (Corma, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130 (48), 16316-16323; Cheung, et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2006, 45 (10), 1617-1620). Example 3. The ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Catalyze Methanol Carbonylation to Acetic Acid with High Single Pass Conversion Materials and Methods Catalysts were pre-oxidized at 350° C. in O 2 and then exposed to a gas mixture of methanol and CO at a molar ratio of 1:1 for reactivity measurements (33 mbar methanol and 33 mbar CO with balance inert). Results The influence of methanol conversion on AA selectivity and catalyst stability for the 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst was investigated, which exhibited the highest volumetric AA production rates still with good selectivity (see FIG. 4 ). To analyze the influence of methanol conversion on selectivity, the 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 in the reactor was increased, while the amount of diluent SBA-15 was decreased such that the space velocity was identical in all experiments. Increasing the catalyst loading resulted in increasing methanol conversion to ˜60%, which was limited from further increases based on the reactor size. The measured AA selectivity was independent of methanol conversion, showing ˜93% selectivity for different methanol conversions ( FIG. 5 ). The highest conversion achieved with 600 mg material is around 60% (see FIG. 4 ) and the selectivity to AA is still as high as 93% (see FIG. 5 ), which shows that the conversion can be significantly increased to meet industrial standards using this ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst. Example 4. The ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Catalyze Methanol Carbonylation to Acetic Acid with High Stability Materials and Methods The stability test was performed on 600 mg of 10% ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts, diluted in 600 mg SiO 2 . This weight loading was chosen as it exhibited the highest selectivity with the highest ReOx weight loading showing isolated structures. The stability of 10% ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts was examined at 280° C. in a stoichiometric feed of methanol and CO (i.e. 30 mbar) with pressure of 30 mbar. Results No measurable change in both reactivity and selectivity of the 10% ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts was observed during the 60 hours measurement period (see FIG. 6 ). FIG. 6 shows a stable ˜60% methanol conversion and 93% AA selectivity over 60 h on stream, demonstrating that the atomically dispersed ReO 4 active sites (i.e. the active sites associated with AA formation) on SiO 2 remain quite stable under the explored reaction conditions (i.e. e.g. 280° C. and pressure of 30 mbar). Example 5. Reaction Pathway for Methanol Carbonylation to AA on ReO 4 /SiO 2 Materials and Methods Mechanistic insights into the observed AA formation on atomically dispersed ReO 4 species and ReOx clusters were developed by executing methanol carbonylation on 10 and 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 at 280° C. with independently varied methanol and CO partial pressures in the range of 30 to 330 mbar and 200 to 600 mbar, respectively. For methanol and CO pressure-dependent experiments, 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 was pretreated by oxidation at 350° C. for 1 h. After the pretreatment, while maintaining a constant temperature of 280° C. and methanol partial pressure at 30 mbar, the CO partial pressure was varied from 200 mbar to 600 mbar with Ar as a diluent. Alternatively, while maintaining a constant temperature of 280° C. and CO partial pressure at 30 mbar, the methanol partial pressure was varied from 30 mbar to 330 mbar and Ar acted as a diluent. The reaction system was held at each condition for 2 h to ensure steady state conditions. Results FIG. 13 A shows that for 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 (mostly atomically dispersed ReO 4 ), a first-order dependence of AA production on methanol partial pressure was observed in the range of 30-90 mbar, which transitioned to a zero-order dependence at higher methanol pressure. This shows that methanol, or a methanol derived intermediate, is first-order in the rate-determining step (RDS) and saturates the active site at methanol partial pressures >˜120 mbar. For 20 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 that contained a mix of atomically dispersed ReO 4 and ReOx clusters, a ˜0.6 reaction order for methanol partial pressure in the AA production rate was observed from 30 to 85 mbar, with an apparent decrease in methanol reaction order at ˜85 mbar, followed by a small increase in methanol reaction order up to ˜120 mbar, and finally a reaction order of 0 above ˜120 mbar. The distinct kinetic behavior of the two types of sites is consistent with the differences in Eapp for AA formation observed in FIGS. 2 A- 2 B and 3 may also be influenced by H 2 O produced due to DME formation. In contrast to methanol, the AA production rate exhibited nearly a first-order (0.8-0.9) dependence on CO partial pressure for both catalysts across a broad partial pressure range from 200 to 600 mbar CO (see FIG. 13 B ). This shows that CO is involved in the RDS and that CO does not exist as an adsorbed species at an appreciable coverage on the active site (Bhan, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2007, 129 (16), 4919-4924; Cheung, et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2006, 45 (10), 1617-1620; Cheung, et al., J. Catal., 2007, 245 (1), 110-123). The nature of bound species during AA formation on atomically dispersed ReO 4 species was analyzed via in situ FTIR measurements executed under varying methanol partial pressure (at a constant CO partial pressure of 30 mbar) at 280° C. on 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 (data not shown). Independent of the methanol partial pressures, two strong bands at 2954 and 2854 cm −1 were observed that correspond to physiosorbed methanol on SiO 2 , as they were also seen on pure SiO 2 (see FIG. 14 ) (Liu, et al., Catal. Lett., 2008, 120 (3-4), 274-280; Clarke, et al., J. Catal., 1994, 150, 81-93). Three bands at 2979, 2922, and 2822 cm −1 (marked with the dashed lines) were also observed. The 2979 and 2922 cm −1 bands are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretches of CH 3 in —OCH 3 bound to ReO 4 , respectively, while 2822 cm −1 is assigned as the first overtone of the symmetric stretch (Burcham, et al., Langmuir, 2001, 17 (20), 6164-6174). Alcohol activation on the homogeneous methyltrioxorhenium complex (MTO, CH 3 ReO 3 ), in which Re exists in a +7 oxidation state, has been studied previously (Zhu, et al., J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61 (1), 324-328; Jacob, et al., Organometallics, 1998, 17 (9), 1835-1840; Korstanje, et al., Chem .- Eur. J., 2013, 19 (39), 13224-13234). On the basis of theoretical analysis and isotopic labeling experiments, it was proposed that dissociative alcohol adsorption occurs through proton transfer from the alcohol to an oxygen native of MTO, resulting in the coordination of —OR group to the Lewis acidic Re center, thus maintaining a +7 oxidation state of Re. This is analogous to the mechanism for ethanol activation over Lewis acidic Al 2 O 3 surfaces, where —OCH 2 CH 3 coordinates to the Lewis acidic Al center, while the proton transfers to a neighboring oxygen (Christiansen, et al., ACS Catal., 2013, 3(9), 1965-1975; DeWilde, et al., ACS Catal., 2013, 3(4), 798-807; Roy, et al., ACS Catal., 2012, 2 (9), 1846-1853; Christiansen, et al., J. Catal., 2015, 323, 121-131; Secordel, et al., Catal. Today, 2010, 155, 177-183). Thus, methanol adsorption onto ReO 4 occurs dissociatively at the O—H group, resulting in the formation of Re(—O—Si)(—OH)(═O) 2 (—OCH 3 ), where Re remains in a +7 oxidation state. With increasing methanol partial pressure in the feed from 42 to 105 mbar, an increase in the intensity of the bands assigned to —OCH 3 stretches was observed, showing an increase in the coverage on ReO 4 sites. However, the —OCH 3 stretch intensities remained unchanged with further increase in the methanol partial pressure to 150 mbar, demonstrating saturation of adsorption sites on ReO 4 species. The in situ FTIR results are consistent with the kinetic measurements shown in FIG. 13 A , where a saturation in the methanol reaction order in AA formation rate correlates with a saturation in —OCH 3 adsorption sites. This shows that the resting state or most abundant surface intermediate (MASI) for the ReO 4 species at methanol partial pressure >˜120 mbar is Re(—OSi)(—OH)(═O) 2 (—OCH 3 ), containing dissociatively adsorbed methanol. The oxidation state of atomically dispersed ReO 4 species was probed with in situ XANES measurements for preoxidized 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 and under methanol carbonylation reaction conditions where kinetic measurements and in situ FTIR show that ReO 4 species should be saturated with —OCH 3 (150 mbar methanol, 200 mbar CO and 250° C.). The XANES region did not change due to exposure to reaction conditions demonstrating that Re was in a +7 oxidation state in the most occupied state in the reaction cycle, consistent with the proposal above (data not shown). While the XANES region of 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 was indistinguishable comparing preoxidized and under reaction conditions, changes in the EXAFS region were observed (see FIG. 15 ). The intensity of the scattering feature associated with scattering from oxygen in the first coordination shell of Re decreased under reaction conditions. These changes could be consistent with a decreased coordination number to shorter Re═O bonds and increased coordination to longer Re—O bonds that have weaker scattering intensity (see FIG. 16 ). It is possible that CO-induced restructuring of ReOx species. The in situ XANES and EXAFS under reaction conditions are consistent with the proposed MASI described above. As shown in Scheme 1, AA formation on atomically dispersed ReO 4 active sites on SiO 2 occurs through dissociative methanol adsorption to form Re(—O—Si)(—OH)(═O) 2 (—OCH 3 ). On the basis of the partial pressure dependent methanol reaction order for AA formation, in situ FTIR, and in situ XAS, this species is the MASI when the methanol partial pressure is >120 mbar. Because the AA formation rate is first order in methanol and CO at lower methanol partial pressures, the RDS is CO insertion into the terminal CH 3 group of the Re(—O—Si)(—OH)(═O) 2 (—OCH 3 ) species. Typically, for methanol carbonylation on homogeneous Rh catalysts, CO insertion is a migratory process into the M—C bond of Rh—CH 3 species (Sunley, et al., Catal. Today, 2000, 58 (4), 293-307; Haynes, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2004, 126 (9), 2847-2861; Maitlis, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans., 1996, 11, 2187-2196). Given the proposed M-O—CH 3 structure for ReO 4 active sites, a similar CO insertion into the carbon end of the bound —O—CH 3 species followed by the rearrangement to acetyl group occurs for ReO 4 active sites. Finally, the proton transfers back to form AA that desorbs, leaving ReO 4 intact (see FIG. 15 ). The rate law for AA formation within this mechanism can be written as: AA \\u2062 Production \\u2062 Rate = k 2 \\u2062 K 1 \\u2062 P CO \\u2062 P CH 3 \\u2062 OH 1 + K 1 \\u2062 P CH 3 \\u2062 OH where K 1 is the equilibrium constant for dissociative methanol adsorption and k 2 is the rate constant for the gas phase attack of CO on surface bound methoxy. At lower methanol partial pressure, vacant sites are abundant, and the denominator of the rate law is approximately equal to 1; thus, the rate law appears as a first-order with respect to methanol and CO partial pressures. In contrast, at higher methanol partial pressures, active sites are saturated with dissociatively adsorbed methanol and the denominator becomes K 1 P CH3OH , which results in a zero-order dependence of AA formation on the methanol partial pressure. An order of magnitude increase in DME production rate comparing atomically dispersed ReO 4 and ReOx clusters was observed, where contiguous acidic sites likely exist on the cluster surfaces, FIG. 2 b . On 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, the DME formation rate exhibited a second-order dependence on methanol up to ˜100 mbar and a transition to a zero-order at higher partial pressures (see FIG. 17 A ). Conversely, on ReOx clusters (20 wt % Re), the DME formation rate was inhibited at methanol partial pressures >85 mbar. The second order dependence on methanol partial pressure is consistent with the bimolecular reaction leading to DME formation. The data in FIG. 17 A shows that ReOx clusters can support supramonolayer methanol or methoxy coverage, which cannot occur on atomically dispersed ReO 4 active sites. Both catalysts exhibited a negative CO reaction order for DME formation, which shows a competition between CO and methanol in reactions with adsorbed —OCH 3 species (see FIG. 17 B ). Example 6. ReO 4 /SiO 2 Reactivity is Promoted with Atomically Dispersed Rh Materials and Methods For the synthesis of atomically dispersed Rh—ReO 4 pair sites on SiO 2 , appropriate amounts of HReO 4 were dissolved in 10 mL of HPLC grade water and the desired amounts of TEA (TEA/Re molar ratio of 8:1) were added into the solution under magnetic stirring for 30 min to ensure the solution was well mixed, following which appropriate amounts of rhodium(III) chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, 307866) were added into the solution, and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min. The precursor solution was injected via syringe pump (5 mL/h) into a 100 mL suspension of the SBA-15 support under magnetic stirring. After being mixed for 12 h at room temperature, the solution was dried at 80° C. using a rotary evaporator. The prepared catalysts were calcined at 450° C. for 4 h under dry air prior to characterization and reactivity measurements. Results From the kinetic data, it is shown that features of the ReO 4 /SiO 2 active site that allow high AA selectivity are (i) reduced rates of DME formation, which may result from the effective blocking of the associative DME formation pathway by the isolated active sites, and (ii) the ability of CO to outcompete methanol in the attack on the terminal CH 3 in bound —OCH 3 species (Corma, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130(48), 16316-16323; Boronat, et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2011, 13(7), 2603-2612). The formation of Rh—ReOx pair-sites on SiO 2 should further promote the AA production rate on atomically dispersed ReO 4 active sites. Atomically dispersed Rh—ReOx pair-sites catalysts were prepared and characterized by CO probe molecule FTIR (Ro, et al., ACS Catal., 2019, 9, 10899-10912). FIG. 18 A shows CO probe molecule FTIR spectra for 0.2 wt % Rh/SiO 2 and 0.2 wt % Rh-10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 at saturation coverage and room temperature. The Rh-ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts are also referred herein as “Rh/Re—SiO 2 ” catalysts. For example, the 0.2 wt % Rh-10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst is also referred herein as a “0.2% Rh/10% Re—SiO 2 ” catalyst. Two strong bands centered at 2091 and 2030 cm −1 were observed for 0.2 wt % Rh/SiO 2 , which are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of the Rh(CO) 2 gem-dicarbonyl species, demonstrating the predominant existence of atomically dispersed Rh species (Yates, et al., J. Chem. Phys., 1983, 79 (2), 1026-1030; Miessner, et al., J. Mol. Catal., 1986, 36 (1986), 369-373). Another CO stretch at 2107 cm −1 was observed, which was assigned to an atomically dispersed Rh species that is simultaneously coordinated to CO and an additional O (Rice, et al., J. Chem. Phys., 1981, 74 (11), 6487-6497). A blue-shift of ˜6 cm −1 in the CO stretch frequency for Rh(CO) 2 species was observed comparing Rh/ReOx-SiO 2 and Rh/SiO 2 . The CO stretch frequency in Rh(CO) 2 depends on the supports ability to withdraw or donate charge to Rh. Thus, the blue shift is evidence that Lewis acidic ReOx species reduced the charge transfer to CO species bound to Rh (Lwin, et al., ACS Catal., 2015, 5 (3), 1432-1444; Ro, et al., ACS Catal., 2019, 9, 10899-10912; Hoffman, et al., ACS Catal., 2018, 8 (4), 3489-3498). A similar blue shift in CO frequency was correlated with the formation of Rh—Re atomically dispersed pair sites on Al 2 O 3 through correlation with HAADF-STEM imaging, providing confidence in the formation of Rh—Re atomically dispersed pair sites in the current catalyst. Methanol carbonylation reactivity measurements at 30 mbar methanol and CO as a function of temperature are shown in FIG. 18 B for 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 and 0.2 wt % Rh/10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15. This comparison showed an order of magnitude increase in the rate of AA formation, without promoting DME formation (see FIG. 19 ) and with the addition of 0.2 wt % Rh. This results in an increase of AA selectivity to ˜96%, even at the stoichiometric, low pressure feed conditions used here. It is noted that 0.2 wt % Rh/SiO 2 showed no measurable methanol conversion under these conditions. Eapp for AA production was measured to be 155±20 and 133±27 kJ mol −1 for 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 and 0.2 wt % Rh/10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15, respectively (see FIG. 20 ). This difference in Eapp is consistent with the difference in Eapp for AA production on the 1, 5, and 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts (see FIG. 2 A ), showing Rh may be selectively promoting AA formation on ReO 4 species rather than modifying the inherent barrier. CO preferentially adsorbs on atomically dispersed Rh compared to methanol or methanol-derived intermediates (Tang, et al., Nat. Commun., 2018, 9 (1), 1-11; Fielicke, et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004, 108(38), 14591-14598). Thus, the formation of Rh(CO) 2 species promotes the attempt frequency of CO insertion into neighboring Re—OCH 3 species. On the basis of the above-described results, the addition of ˜0.2 wt % of atomically dispersed Rh to 10 wt % atomically dispersed ReO 4 (i.e. Rh-ReOx) on SiO 2 increased AA selectivity to more than 96%, resulting in volumetric AA production rates comparable to homogeneous processes. Example 7. The Volumetric AA Production Rates on Rh—ReO 4 /SiO 2 Catalyst are on Par with Those of the Monsanto Process Materials and Methods The volumetric and per metal site reaction rates of AA production on atomically dispersed ReO 4 /SBA-15 and Rh—ReO 4 /SBA-15 were calculated and compared with other heterogeneous and homogeneous systems (see Table 4).

HI (Homogenous) a Unit conversion from mmol/g/s to mmol/dm 3 /s was estimated using catalyst densities and volume fractions. Results As shown in Table 4, the AA production rates on a per g of metal basis observed for the Re-based catalysts reported here are competitive with Cu modified zeolites (Yashima, et al., J. Catal., 1979, 59(1), 53-60; Ni, et al., Catal. Sci. Technol., 2017, 7(20), 4818-4822), atomically dispersed Rh on polymer supports (Ren, et al., J. Catal., 2019, 369, 249-256), and atomically dispersed Ir—La site pairs (Kwak, et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2014, 5(3), 566-572; Ren, et al., Chin. J. Catal., 2018, 39 (6), 1060-1069), albeit in the absence of high operating pressure, high CO/MeOH feed ratios, and halide cofeeds. The volumetric AA production rates on the Rh—ReO 4 /SBA-15 catalyst in a fixed bed process are on par with those of the Monsanto process and a few-fold lower than those of the Cavita process (Maitlis, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans., 1996, 11, 2187-2196). This comparison demonstrates the substantial potential and operational advantages of the Rh—ReO 4 /SBA-15 catalyst reported here. Given that the reaction rates reported here are from measurements at ˜30 mbar CO and methanol, and that first order behavior in CO was observed up to 600 mbar partial pressure, it is expected that operation at higher pressure equimolar CO and methanol feeds will significantly further promote volumetric AA production rates. Further, optimization of the Rh and Re loadings on the basis of volumetric production rate per catalyst cost will allow further optimization of catalyst performance Example 8. The ReOx/SBA-15 Catalysts Catalyze Methyl Acetate Carbonylation to Acetic Anhydride Materials and Methods Atomically dispersed ReO 4 /SBA-15 was tested for methyl acetate carbonylation to produce acetic anhydride (CH 3 CO) 2 O. The catalytic activity for methanol carbonylation was evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz reactor in the temperature of 240, 260 and 280° C. operating at atmospheric pressure. All gas flows were controlled by mass flow controllers (Teledyne Hastings) and an in-line bubbler was used to deliver gas phase methyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, HPLC Grade, CAS 79-20-9) to the catalyst. Helium (Airgas, UHP, 99.999%) was used to bubble methyl acetate. The reaction effluent was quantified with online mass spectrometry (HALO 201, Hiden Analytical Inc.). The following m/z values were used to detect each product: m/z=28 for CO, m/z=74 for methyl acetate, and m/z=87 for acetic anhydride. The concentrations were calibrated to the signal intensity at each mass and He was used as an internal standard. Prior to reactivity measurements catalysts were pre-treated by oxidation at 350° C. for 1 hour with pure O 2 at 50 mL min −1 , followed by measurements at varying temperatures. The system was allowed two hours at each temperature to ensure steady state was achieved. 200 mg of 10 wt % ReOx/SBA-15 was then exposed to a gas mixture of methyl acetate and CO at a molar ratio of 1:1 for reactivity measurements (177 mbar methyl acetate and 177 mbar CO with balance inert). At the temperature of 240, 260 and 280° C., mass spectrometry analysis was employed to detect methyl acetate and CO for conversion calculation and the desired product acetic anhydride. Results This reaction was previously reported to achieve in the homogeneous system containing a nickel, rhodium or iridium source and iodide cocatalyst. The reaction started from iodide salts reaction with methyl acetate to generate methyl iodide and the corresponding acetate salts (Polichnowski, J. Chem. Educ., 1986, 63 (3), 206-209). Oxidative addition of methyl iodide to metal produced methyl-metal species, followed by the rapid insertion of carbon to yield an acyl-metal species (Schrod and Luff, Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev., 1981, 20 (4), 649-653). Finally, the reductive elimination of acetyl iodide regenerated the active metal sites (Conifer, et al., Organometallics, 2011, 30 (15), 4060-4066; Gong, et al., J. Mol. Catal. A Chem., 1999, 147 (1-2), 113-124). The production of acetic anhydride was obtained either by the reaction of acetyl iodide with methyl acetate or by the reaction of acetyl iodide with acetate salts and this step was believed to be the rate limiting step (Polichnowski, J. Chem. Educ., 1986, 63 (3), 206-209; Marr, et al., Inorg. Chem. Commun., 2000, 3 (11), 617-619). The proposed mechanism for methyl acetate carbonylation on atomically dispersed ReO 4 species is methyl acetate being activated to methyl and acetyl on ReO 4 followed by CO insertion into the methyl group (see Scheme 2). The surface —CH 3 —CO reacts with —O—(CO)—CH 3 species to produce acetic anhydride and regenerate ReO 4 species. Methyl acetate conversion increased from 0.5% to 9% as temperature increased from 240 to 280° C. (see FIG. 21 A ). Acetic anhydride production rates in the explored temperature range increased from 0.0004 to 0.0028 mmol s −1 g Re −1 (see FIG. 21 B ). As shown in FIG. 21 C , the selectivity to acetic anhydride decreased from 22% to 17% in this temperature range. The data in the Examples shows that ReO x sites of ReO x /SBA-15 catalysts with ≤10% Re weight loading are atomically dispersed (i.e. isolated ReO 4 species on inert SiO 2 support). Atomically dispersed ReO 4 species on inert SiO 2 supports were observed to be heterogeneous carbonylation catalysts (e.g. methanol carbonylation or methyl acetate carbonylation) without the need for a halide cofeed. In methanol carbonylation, the catalytic process exhibited mechanistic similarities to zeolite-based carbonylation catalysts, although the Re-based catalysts promote CO insertion into methoxy species to produce AA, while zeolite catalysts favor methanol insertion into methoxy species prior to carbonylation. The combination of these ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts with Rh or other metals allows further improvements in AA production rates and selectivity. Through promotion of the atomically dispersed ReOx/SBA-15 with atomically dispersed Rh, AA production rates rivaling reports of the Monsanto process were achieved. Other dispersed strong Lewis acids (e.g., AlO x , WO x , MoO x ) on inert supports (mesoporous SiO 2 or carbon-based materials) may provide similar reactivity. This work introduces a new class of methanol carbonylation catalysts and discusses how atomically dispersed pairs sites could act cooperatively to drive catalytic processes.

No. 16/811,776 filed on Mar. 6, 2020, which takes priority from patent application Ser. No. 16/782,112 filed on Feb. 5, 2020. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to outdoor surface construction and more specifically to mortar and block products made with photoluminescent products, which includes a mortar mix, polymeric sand, pavers, coping blocks, concrete blocks and ceramic tile that provide illumination without the need for electrical power. Discussion of the Prior Art Paving blocks are used for walkways, large public pedestrian areas, driveways, paths and the like. The paving blocks allow ground action without deterioration. Paving blocks, like cement blocks for pathways, can be laid in various patterns that are aesthetically pleasing. Walkway lighting for pathways have been used along with paving blocks to increase safety, provide sure footing and visibility. Many walkways are illuminated with low or medium voltage lighting, and must be furnished with low-or medium voltage electricity to power an illumination system. There are electrical consumption costs associated with the use of illumination systems. There are also difficulties in setup of the illumination system, if the walkway is a long walkway or is located at a distance from an electrical connection. A licensed contractor must be hired to install electrical supplies for the illumination system. The use of outdoor lighting is known in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,280 to Connors et. al (Connors) discloses an interlocking paving block with interior illumination capability. However Conners does not allow for non-electrical use of an outdoor light. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,472,737 to Anders (Anders 737) discloses a photoluminescent highway paint composition that is painted on highways to aid in driving. However, Anders 737 does not disclose the use of paving blocks. Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,024 to Anders et al (Anders 024) discloses a photoluminescent overlay that covers existing signs and gives moisture stability to the phosphorescent materials. However, Anders 024 does not disclose the use of paving blocks. While the above-described devices fulfill their respective objections and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not describe a photoluminescent paving block that allows for being used for outdoor lighting. Connors makes no provision for non-electrical use, since it includes an insect bulb and wiring. Anders 737 and 024 only disclose the use of photoluminescent material in conjunction with paving blocks. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 6,665,986 to Kaplan discloses a phosphorescent paving block. Patent publication no. 2006/0065879 to Beimel discloses a luminous cementitious composition and methods of making and using the same. U.S. Pat. No. 8,617,638 to Hill discloses a method of manufacturing photoluminescent pavers at a paver manufacturing facility. However, U.S. Pat. No. 9,114,422 to Toma et al. discloses a paving block with embedded photoluminescent material. U.S. Pat. No. 9,114,422 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 10,519,612 to Toma discloses a paving block with improved illumination, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to macromolecules and polymers based on such macromolecules, preferably bio-based and degradable or compostable macromolecules and polymers. Such macromolecules and polymers can be used as building blocks for block copolymers having characteristics suitable for use in a wide range of applications, including adhesives and especially hot melt adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION While bio-based and degradable or compostable polymers are well-known, few provide the proper properties to replace styrene block copolymers (SBc) currently used to formulate hot melt adhesive (HMA) and pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) products. Current bio-based materials are simply not well-suited to generate low modulus, elastomeric adhesives with high bonding performance. Currently, there is not a commercial material available that possesses the phase-separated morphology and displays the desired hard-soft behavior offered by SBc-based adhesives. As used herein, “bio-based” means that the material is made using sustainable sources and not petroleum-based products. In Poly. Chem., 2015, 6, 1445, the authors describe both the conversion of alkyl-substituted 1,2-epoxides to lactone species and the subsequent ring-opening polymerization to provide PLA-PHA-PLA triblock materials. A homopolymer of one long-chain alky lactone with R=n-C 10 H 21 (referred to as β-TBL) is reported. It was made using benzyl alcohol and not a diol initiator; accordingly, the resultant polymer is not a diol. The polymerization kinetics of β-TBL are examined, but, unlike the Me, Et, and n-Bu derivatives described in the paper, little characterization is reported on the properties of the polymer nor is the analog of the triblock produced. Interestingly, the authors find shorter chain hydroxyl butyric acid (HBA) species to be miscible as Tg values for the HBA block are shifted at even low n values for PLA (n=10, m=100) and collapse to a single Tg at higher values (n=50, m=100) for the methyl derivative. Similar trends were seen for the ethyl derivative. The n-butyl derivative is largely unaffected even up to n=100 and m=75. At higher PLA levels (n=75 and m=100), the Tg collapses, implying the phases have some degree of miscibility. Also of note with regard to the novelty of the polymers proposed in this paper, the authors make the following statement: While both homopolymerization and copolymerization using β-BL are well understood, there has not yet been a study of the effect of changing the nature of the alkyl substituent in R lactone polymerization. To address this, we now report our efforts in expanding the synthesis of ABA block copolymers of L-lactide and β-lactones while also using several different alkyl chain lengths (methyl, ethyl and n-butyl) and their relationship to microphase separation. In the above comment, β-BL refers to the R group shown below: International Patent Publication No. WO 2013/128175 describes the ring-opening polymerization of lactone of a suitable cyclic ester monomer, optionally in combination with one or more suitable cyclic ester comonomers, in the presence of a compound of Formula 1 of that publication. The compound of Formula 1 is an aluminum-based catalyst of the class used to perform the ring opening polymerization in the literature reference cited above. It does report using this catalyst with cyclic esters in general and to produce various blocky architecture. International Patent Publication No. WO 2000/077072 describes a catalyst system to make random copolymers of methyl lactone (R=Me) and a long-chain lactone (R=C-16) via a ring-opening polymerization process. U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,452 relates to a method of preparing a polyester comprising polymerizing at least one β-substituted-β-propiolactone in the presence of an initiating amount of alkylzinc alkoxide in bulk or in solvent. Example 12 reports an isotactic random copolymer made from chiral methyl (R=Me) and a long-chain lactone (pentadecyl, R=C 15 H 31 ). The copolymer composition on a molar basis is 95% Me-lactone and 5% C 15 -lactone with Mn=146,000 g/mol and Mw=210,000 g/mol. It possesses a Tm of 145° C. In ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng., 2020, 8, 12036, the authors describe the use of diol initiated ring-opening polymerizations that lead to PLA-polyester-PLA triblocks. The midblock is formed from a Cis-alkyl-substituted caprolactone, a 7-membered ring, that serves as the soft midblock when polymerized. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There remains a need to provide biobased and degradable or compostable macromolecules or polymers which provide the proper properties to replace styrene block copolymers (SBc) currently used to formulate hot melt adhesive (HMA) and pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) products.

The values of m′ and p may have ranges of values such that these overall ranges are achieved (e.g, m′ would be between 10-m and 10,000-m when the β-lactone monomers of formula II are present but the higher lactone monomers of formula III are not present).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of certain embodiments of the invention and the working examples. As used herein, the term “residue” (also referred to herein as a polymerized product) shall mean the product of a reactant, such as the moiety remaining from a monomer in a polymer or from a polymer in a block copolymer wherein that polymer is one of the blocks of the block copolymer. For example, the residue of a diol initiator HO-D-OH is the moiety -O-D-O-. As used herein, the term “macromolecule” shall mean an oligomer or polymer, namely a substance that has a molecular structure consisting mostly or entirely of two or more similar or identical units bonded together. According to an embodiment of the invention, a macromolecule comprises a ring-opened polymerized product of β-lactone monomers of formula I: and has a structure of formula IA: wherein: (1) R 2 is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group; (2) m is between 10 and 10,000, preferably between 20 and 5,000 and (3) one of the following: a. the macromolecule is not hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms; b. the macromolecule is not hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 11, preferably between 12 and 26, and most preferably between 14 and 22 carbon atoms; and c. the macromolecule is hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms. Macromolecules of the present invention are derived from long-alkyl chain epoxides. Exemplary epoxide starting materials needed to make the lactone species of formula I above are commercially available from Cargill and sold under the brand name of Vikolox. Suitable examples of these 1,2-long-chain epoxides include: Vikolox 10 (R=n-octyl), Vikolox 12 (R=n-decyl), Vikolox 14 (R=n-dodecyl), Vikolox 16 (R=n-tetradecyl), and Vikolox 18 (R=hexadecyl). The inventive materials are produced by performing a carbonylation reaction on a long-alkyl chain epoxide to generate a β-lactone. The lactone subsequently undergoes a ring opening polymerization to yield a polyester in the poly(hydroxyalkonaote), PHA, family, as shown in FIG. 1 . Use of such commercially-available epoxides as starting materials offers a viable alternative to other methods for making PHA-based polymers that do not have such a readily available source of raw materials. The lactones of formulas I or II can be made from a starting epoxide by carbonylation. For example, an epoxy (such as 1,2-epoxyhexadecane) and one or more catalysts (such as ClCr (TTP) and dicobalt octacarbonyl) may be dissolved in a solvent in a pressure-rated reaction vessel. The vessel can then be flushed with carbon monoxide and heated to carbonylate the epoxide. Carbonylation of internal epoxides can also be performed to give di-substituted lactones. FIG. 2 shows an example of one such internal epoxide produced by Arkema and sold under the trade name Vikoflex 7150. This material is derived from canola oil and similar epoxides derived from bio-renewable feedstocks are of particular interest as few bio-based and biodegradable polymers with a rubber-like properties are currently commercially available. The macromolecule of formula IA, which is a homopolymer, meets one of the following conditions: a. the macromolecule is not hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms; b. the macromolecule is not hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 11, preferably between 12 and 26, and most preferably between 14 and 22 carbon atoms; or c. the macromolecule is hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms. As used herein, the term “alkyl” group is intended to mean straight chain alkyl groups, branched alkyl groups, and cycloalkyl groups and to exclude aromatic groups. In addition, R 2 in formula IA above is hydrogen, an alkyl group, or a substituted alkyl group. As used herein, a “substituted alkyl group” is intended to mean an alkyl group which is substituted in any way, such as by a heteroatom (e.g., sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen) taking the place of a carbon atom, a halide taking the place of a hydrogen atom, or with some functional group (e.g., an ester group, a (meth)acrylate, a urethane linkage, or a urea linkage) either as a branch to the alkyl group, a terminus of the alkyl group, or as part of the alkyl chain. In one example, the epoxide of FIG. 2 is used to produce the corresponding lactone, via carbonylation, such that R 1 is C 8 H 17 and R 2 is methyl ester of epoxidized canola oil. The end groups of the macromolecule according to the invention may be controlled depending on the ring-opening polymerization process employed. In an embodiment of the invention, the macromolecule is hydroxy-terminated and R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms. To achieve this, the ring-opening transesterification polymerization (ROTEP) is done using a diol-initiator, such as 1,4-benzenedimethanol, along with a metal catalyst to provide hydroxy-terminated polymers, as shown in FIG. 3 . More specifically, 1,4-benzenedimethanol initiator, Sn(octyl) 2 catalyst, and the β-lactone of formula I can be dissolved in a solvent and placed in a pressure-rated reaction vessel. The sealed vessel can then be heated under sufficient conditions to polymerize the β-lactone monomer. The vessel can then be cooled to room temperature and the reaction product can then be precipitated using another solvent to provide poly(β-lactone). The copolymerization of the β-lactone of formula I along with one or both of the other lactone monomers shown in formulas II or III would be substantially similar. Alternatively, a long-chain diol, such as a hydroxy-terminated macromolecule or polymer like polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, could also be employed as an initiator to impart flexibility to the main polymer chain. In these embodiments using a diol as an initiator, the resulting macromolecule is also a diol having the formula IB: In another embodiment of the invention, the macromolecule is hydroxy-terminated and has three or more hydroxyl groups. In such embodiments, the macromolecule is a polyol having three or more hydroxyl groups and has the following formula IC: wherein BA is a hydrocarbon residue from a polyol initiator having three or more hydroxyl groups and b is at least 3 and preferably between 3 and 6. Each moiety is bonded to the initiator residue. In such embodiments, the initiator is a triol, such as glycerol, or has more than three hydroxyl groups. For example, using glycerol as the initiator would result in a trifunctional macromolecule, with each moiety bonded to the glycerol residue, —OCH 2 C(CH 2 O—)HCH 2 CH 2 O—. Embodiments of the invention include macromolecules in which both or all terminal groups are hydroxyl groups or less than all of the terminal groups are hydroxyl terminated. In the embodiments stating that the macromolecule is not hydroxy-terminated, none of the terminal groups of the macromolecule are hydroxyl groups. Polymers can be made from racemic mixtures of lactones of formula I above, and the resulting polymers would be homopolymers. Alternatively, the stereochemistry can be preserved during the carbonylation reaction of the epoxides to provide chiral lactone monomers starting from enantiomerically-pure epoxides, as shown in FIG. 4 . Ring-opening polymerization on mixtures of the chiral materials can be performed to control the tacticity—and in turn—the thermal and mechanical properties of the final product. It is expected, however, that use of a single enantiomerically pure monomer alone will yield isotactic PHA species like those produced by bacteria from biomasses and provide higher than desired melt points and poor elastomeric behaviour (high yield stress and low elongation at yield). In an embodiment of the invention, the macromolecule is made from β-lactone monomers of formula I consisting essentially of, or consisting of, a racemic mixture of the R-lactone and S-lactone stereoisomers. In another embodiment of the invention, the macromolecule is made from β-lactone monomers of formula I consisting essentially of, or consisting of, the R-lactone stereoisomer. In another embodiment of the invention, the macromolecule is made from β-lactone monomers of formula I consisting essentially of, or consisting of, the S-lactone stereoisomer. In this context, the language “consisting essentially of” is intended to describe a monomer which is substantially enantiomerically pure and the language “consisting of” is intended to describe a monomer which is enantiomerically pure. The inventive polymers may be homopolymers made solely from the β-lactone monomers of formula I as described above or, in other embodiments, could be copolymers made from one or more other types of monomers. By using a mixture of other monomers, including other lactone monomers, the mechanical and thermal properties for the end use application of the macromolecule could be tailored. In one such embodiment, the macromolecule comprises a ring-opened polymerized product of the β-lactone monomers of formula I and β-lactone monomers of formula II: and has a structure of the formula IIA: wherein: (1) at least one of: R 1 ′ is not the same as R 1 or R 2 ′ is not the same as R 2 ; (2) R 2 is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group; (3) R 2 ′ is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group; (4) the total of m and m′ is between 10 and 10,000, preferably between 20 and 5,000; and (5) R 1 and R 1 ′ are each independently an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms. As with the homopolymer described above, the macromolecule may be hydroxy-terminated or not. When the macromolecule of the embodiment made also from the β-lactone monomers of formula II is a diol, and therefore made from an initiator which is a diol, it has the following formula IIB: wherein D is a hydrocarbon residue from a diol initiator. The macromolecule is a random copolymer. Similar to the homopolymer embodiment described above, in the embodiment of the invention in which the β-lactone monomers of formula II are present, the macromolecule may be also be a polyol having three or more hydroxyl groups having the following formula IIC: wherein BA is a hydrocarbon residue from a polyol initiator having three or more hydroxyl groups and b is at least 3 and preferably between 3 and 6. In the embodiment of the invention in which the β-lactone monomers of formula II are present, the ratio of m to m′ may vary over a wide range, 1:99 and 99:1, preferably 1:9 to 9:1. According to another embodiment of the invention, higher lactone monomers of formula III below are used with the β-lactone monomers of formula I, either alone or along with the β-lactone monomers of formula II. In this embodiment, the macromolecule comprises a ring-opened polymerized product of the β-lactone monomers of formula I and higher lactone monomers of formula III: wherein X=(CH 2 ) a , or and has a structure of the formula IIIA. wherein: (1) R 2 is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group; (2) a is at least 3, preferably from 3 to 8, most preferably from 4 to 7; (3) the total of m and p is between 10 and 10,000, preferably between 20 and 5,000; and (4) R 1 is an alkyl group having at least 8, preferably between 8 and 26, more preferably between 8 and 22 carbon atoms. As with the embodiments described above, the macromolecule may be hydroxy-terminated or not. When the macromolecule of the embodiment made also from the higher lactone monomers of formula III is a diol, and therefore made from an initiator which is a diol, it has the following formula IIIB: wherein D is a hydrocarbon residue from a diol initiator. Similar to the embodiments described above, in the embodiment of the invention in which the higher lactone monomers of formula III are present, the macromolecule may be also be a polyol having three or more hydroxyl groups having the following formula IIIC: wherein BA is a hydrocarbon residue from a polyol initiator having three or more hydroxyl groups and b is at least 3 and preferably between 3 and 6. In the embodiment of the invention in which the higher lactone monomers of formula III are present, the ratio of m to p may vary over a wide range, 1:99 and 99:1, preferably 1:9 to 9:1. Copolymerization of the β-lactone monomers of formula I and the higher lactone monomers of formula III, such as ε-caprolactone, can be carried out in an inert atmosphere by combining an initiator (such as 1,4-Benzenedimethanol), a catalyst (such as Sn(octyl) 2 catalyst), and the β-lactone and ε-caprolactone monomers in a suitable molar ratio, such as a ratio β-to-ε lactone of 2:1. The reactants can be dissolved in a solvent then heated in a pressure-rated reaction vessel under conditions to cause copolymerization. After cooling the vessel to room temperature, the reaction product can be precipitated by using a solvent to provide the copolymer, such as poly(β-lactone-co-ε-caprolactone). Copolymerization of the long-chain β-lactones may also be performed with other larger-ring heterocyclic comonomers such as γ-(five carbon) and δ-(six carbon), and higher lactones, as shown in FIG. 5 , in a similar manner. Inclusion of these comonomers as well as their derivatives with pendant alkyl groups can be performed to alter the thermal and hydrolytic stabilities as well as the overall crystallinity and mechanical properties of the inventive polymers. Introduction of some stereoregularity (tacticity) in the mid-block is also a possible option to optimize the inventive PHA performance. Bacteria/biomass derived long chain PHA's are isotactic and this more regular array of side groups gives them crystalline behavior. For example, relatively long-chain isotactic PHAs (R=10 and 12) display Tm values in the range of 40 to 80° C. These systems may display more crystallinity than desired for the reasons described above. Nevertheless, introduction of some degree of crystallinity using judiciously selected mixtures of enantiomerically-pure or enriched lactone monomers could be employed to target materials with fairly low crystallinity with Tm values in the range of 20-40° C., potentially allowing for tackifier free systems to be developed that display creep resistance. If the overall crystallinity is low and these materials can be plasticized to effectively depress the crystallinity even further, the materials might function well as PSA's where tack is required at room temperature. The introduction of some lower chain alkyl moieties into the PHA backbone (R=octyl or less) could serve a similar role to change thermal behaviour as is proposed by introducing tacticity above. PHA polymers could be generated using mixtures of long-chain lactone monomers, for example a random copolymer of C 8 and C 18 n-alkyls substituents. Although this likely will not change the thermal behaviour dramatically as atactic PHA copolymers, it is potentially a method to vary the van der Waals bonding forces exhibited by adhesive made from the inventive polymers, copolymers, and block copolymers. Such variations could allow the adhesives to be designed to selectively fail adhesively or cohesively. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the β-lactone monomers of formula I are non-functionalized and, preferably, the β-lactone monomers of formula II are also non-functionalized and/or the higher lactone monomers of formula III are also non-functionalized. As used herein, the term “non-functionalized” means that the monomer does contain any groups that would polymerize or otherwise react upon application of heat, uv-curing, and/or catalysis, other than the lactone group itself or its precursor which forms the polymer backbone. Thus, embodiments using monomers which are non-functionalized would not be suitable to make cross-linkable, curable adhesives. Monomers in accordance with this embodiment (i.e., that are non-functionalized) may nonetheless contain linkages, such as ester, urethane, ether, amide, or other linkages, and still be deemed ‘non-functionalized. In other embodiments, at least one of or all of the β-lactone monomers of formula I, the β-lactone monomers of formula II, and the higher lactone monomers of formula III are functionalized and thereby contain at least one functional group, such as (meth)acrylates, that could cross-link in situ. One aspect of the invention is to develop elastomeric, rubber-like polymers. From a mechanical property standpoint, the inventive PHA polyesters are designed to display low storage modulus values. In embodiments of the invention, the macromolecules described above have at least one, preferably at least two, more preferably at least three, still more preferably at least 4, and most preferably all five of the following characteristics: a. A storage modulus of G′<10 6 Pa at 20° C.; b. Elongation at break values of between 100-3,000%; c. Low melting points (Tm<60° C.); d. No or low crystallinity (as evidenced by DSC); and e. A glass transition temperature, Tg, of between about −100 to 60° C. The rheology of a given hot melt adhesive can be determined using a TA Instruments rheometer, such as an Ares 3 model, consistent with Dynamic Temperature Testing described in ASTM D4440-01. A temperature step procedure may be used to determine the storage modulus, G′, at various temperatures. The instrument may be set to a frequency of 10 radians per second, the sample may be melted at 170° C., and the temperature may be reduced to −40° C. at 10° C. per minute. The parallel plates may have a 25 mm diameter and a 1.6 millimeter gap. As used herein elongation at break values are determined in accordance with ASTM D638. The melting point, Tm, is determined according to ASTM D7138 using DSC, and glass transition temperature is determined in accordance with according to ASTM D3417. Such low modulus PHA polyester-diols or triols (or polyesters of higher hydroxyl functionality) could find utility in a variety of applications. For example, macromolecules of the present invention which are diols can be reacted with diacids or diesters to make (co)polyesters, or they can be reacted with diisocyanates to polyurethanes. Similarly, they could be reacted with acid-terminated polyesters or NCO-end capped polyurethanes to provide species with compostable/biodegradable elastomeric blocks. Another method of the invention comprises reacting the diol macromolecules (or macromolecules of higher functionality) of the present invention with siloxides to form alkoxysilane-terminated oligomer or polymer, for example having —Si(OMe) 3 and —Si(OEt) 3 end groups, to provide moisture curable polymers. In still another embodiment of the invention, such diol-terminated PHA species could also be employed to produce tri-block copolymers. For example, the polymers can serve as diol-macromonomer initiators in ring-opening trans-esterification polymerization (ROTEP) of lactide to provide triblock species with another polymer backbone as end-blocks. Thus, an embodiment of the invention is a triblock copolymer having an A:B:A backbone, wherein block B comprises the residue of the any of the macromolecules described above, and block A selected from the group consisting of polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polystyrene, polyhydroxybutyrates, PMMA, or polyamides, or copolymers thereof. FIG. 6 is an example in which Block A is a residue of polylactic acid. More generally, block A may be any ring-opened polymerized product of lactide. This includes polylactide copolymers of lactic acid and lactones, such as glycolide and caprolactone. In a preferred embodiment, block A comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of polylactic acid. As will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, reference herein to a polymer in a block structure means the residue of that polymer as it is in the form of a block copolymer. Alternatively, the triblock systems can be prepared via living ROTEP using a non-diol initiator and sequential monomer addition, as shown in FIG. 7 . Similar methods may be employed to produce both di- and multi-block copolymers. Free radical polymerization and other polymerization methods may be used to make the triblock copolymers of the present invention. For example, a hydroxy-terminated macromolecule according to any embodiment of the invention can be used as a macroinitiator, by dissolving it in a solvent along with a catalyst (such as Sn(octyl) 2 ), and DL-lactide in a sealed reaction vessel. The reactants can then be heated under conditions to polymerize the lactide monomers, initiated at the hydroxyl groups at the terminal ends of the macromolecule starting material. After cooling, the reaction product may be precipitated using a solvent to provide the PLA-poly(β-lactone-co-ε-caprolactone)-PLA triblock polymer as shown in FIG. 6 . The molar percents of the two blocks may vary over a wide range, with the triblock copolymer comprising 95 to 40 molar percent of the block B and 60 to 5 molar percent of the block A, preferably 95 to 60 molar percent of block B and 40 to 5 molar percent of block A. The most preferred end-blocks (i.e., referred to herein also as block A) are materials known to display biodegradability or composability like that of the PHA mid-block. The end-blocks should display high modulus values to provide toughness and thermal resistance to the material. In some embodiments, such modulus values may be in the range of 10 6 to 10 9 Pa at 20° C. Towards this end, these “hard blocks” can be crystalline in nature displaying melt points, Tm, in the range of 60 to 165° C. Alternatively, the end-blocks may be amorphous species with Tg values ranging from 40 to 200° C. In contrast, the mid-block (i.e., block B) is elastomeric or rubbery and has a lower Tg as indicated above and preferably at most 40° C., preferably at most 30° C., more preferably at most 25° C., and still more preferably at most 0° C., and most preferably at most −20° C., all depending on the needs presented by the ultimate application of the block polymer. If crystalline, block B may have a melting point, Tm, below 30° C., preferably below 25° C. For optimal performance, the end-blocks are designed to display poor miscibility with the PHA mid-block leading to distinct phases in the block copolymer. Poor miscibility can be demonstrated by the two blocks showing microphase separation, as evidenced by differences in crystallinity and/or distinct glass transition temperatures, Tg, in the DSC. This can be noted by seeing only minor shifts in the Tg values of any signals present in the DCS of the block copolymers (note: if one of the materials is present at low amounts—for example in a 5-90-5 triblock copolymer, end-block signals are typically weak and can't be seen for the lower weight percent fraction). The phase separation is critical in certain applications as it enables the polymer to display the positive features of the individual segments. For example, low modulus at room temperature while still having good thermal resistance or ability to set up quickly and yet still provide creep resistance in an elastic adhesive application. Miscibility can result in the materials displaying compromised properties between those of the individual segments and closer to those of a random copolymer made from the materials. Materials showing good miscibility between blocks may still find utility in hot melt adhesives or in other applications not requiring high tack at room temperature, however. Block A, such as the PLA end-groups, can be made from various isomers of monomers. For example, the PLA end groups may be made from a racemic mixture of the D- and L-stereoisomers; from lactide monomers consisting essentially of, or consisting of, L-lactide stereoisomers; or from lactide monomers consisting essentially of, or consisting of, D-lactide stereoisomers. The selection of the stereochemistry of the monomers of the end blocks may be based on the desired thermal properties of the block copolymer. The L,L isomer provides crystalline end-blocks, melting in the range of 150-200° C.; polymers from racemic mixtures, on the other hand, are amorphous and display Tg values in the range of 50-70° C. In embodiments of the invention, the macromolecule of the invention or the triblock copolymer made therefrom are compostable. As used herein, the term “compostable” as applied to an adhesive is an adhesive which meets the requirements of either: (1) the Disintegration Testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ISO 20200) (84 day compost exposure) or (2) the Aerobic Biodegradation as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58±2° C. at 141 days). In other words, the adhesive will reach a minimum of 90% weight loss within 84 days under the Disintegration Testing conditions or will have reached at least 90% carbon conversion (based on CO 2 production) within 141 days according to the Aerobic Biodegradation testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58±2° C. at 141 days). In preferred embodiments, the adhesive meets the requirements of both: (1) the Disintegration Testing as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ISO 20200) (84 day compost exposure) and (2) the Aerobic Biodegradation as defined by ASTM D 6400-12 (using ASTM 5338-15) (at 58±2° C. at 141 days). In terms of molecular weight, the inventive PHA polymers possess a degree of polymerization, m, of anywhere from 20 to 2,000 with number average molecular weights, Mn, of m×MW lactone monomer; as ROTEP is living in nature and gives polydispersity values only slightly above 1, the weight average Mw values will be very close to the Mn. Molecular weight values of the inventive polymers can be determined using a variety of methods including NMR analysis as well as those well-known in the art. Values herein refer to absolute values based on degree of polymerization. In the case of diol initiated ROTEP, m can be between 10-1000 as branches grow off both sides of the diol. For the hard segments in block copolymers, the degree of polymerization, n, can be between 20-1000. In terms of block copolymer composition, any combination of m and n values can be used. Most preferred will be those containing 95 to 40 molar percent of the inventive PHA and 60 to 5 molar percent of the “hard” end block segments such that the overall storage modulus (G′) of the block copolymer is not substantially higher than 10 6 Pa at room temperature to maintain tack when formulated. For example, a PLA-PHA-PLA triblock copolymer using the lactone of formula I with R 1 =C 10 H 21 (MW monomer=184 g/mol) to generate a midblock with a 90,000 g/mol molecular weight (m=489 moles) and two 5,000 g/mol PLA end-blocks (n=69 moles for each), the net molar composition would be a 11 mol % PLA-78 mol % PHA-11 mol % PLA. The inventive PHA polymers and block copolymers can be used in hot met adhesives, HMA, and embodiments of the invention are especially suitable for use in pressure sensitive adhesives. Accordingly, the PHA “soft blocks” may be tailored to provide optimal properties for displaying tack over a range of temperatures. Specifically, the mid-blocks may be designed to have low crystallinity and low modulus values with their highest thermal transition (Tg or Tm) below 40° C. The most preferred inventive PHA materials for use in PSA applications are those that show little crystallinity or are completely amorphous. These may be formed from polymerization of racemic long-chain alkyl lactone monomers along with the β-lactone monomers of formula I. The Tg values for these materials may be below −60° C. Low crystallinity or amorphous mid-blocks are also desirable as they are most likely to be easily plasticized to enable the adhesives to flow readily and wet out surfaces to form strong bonds. They also should display good long-term compatibility with plasticizers and other formulation components, such as tackifiers, used in hot melt and pressure sensitive adhesives. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a multipurpose hot melt adhesive comprises: 5 to 40 weight percent of a PLA-PHA-PLA triblock copolymer as described herein; 20 to 70 weight percent of a tackifier; 0 to 30 weight percent of a plasticizer, such as castor oil; and 0.1 to 4 weight percent antioxidant. Optional additives (up to 50% by weight) may be incorporated into the hot melt compositions depending on the end use of the composition. Among these additives may be included colorants such as titanium dioxide; fluorescent agents; and fillers such as talc, clay, calcium carbonate, silica, mica, wollastonite, feldspar, aluminum silicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, glass microspheres, ceramic microspheres, thermoplastic micropheres, baryte and wood flour, as well as minor amounts (e.g., less than about 5%) of a wax such as a petroleum derived wax, a synthetic wax or a polyolefin wax. In other embodiments of the invention, adhesive formulations comprising the macromolecule of FIG. 6 can be made by mixing it with the other ingredients, optionally including Sylvalite RE80HP rosin ester as a tackifier, via solution or melt blending. The formulations may include the macromolecule of FIG. 6 to rosin Ester ratios of 20, 40, 60, and 80% tackifier (based the loading of just these two ingredients). In accordance with such embodiments, such hot melt adhesives are suitable for use as both a construction and elastic attachment adhesive for disposable soft goods, such as disposable diapers, feminine sanitary napkins, surgical drapes, hospital pads, and adult incontinent products, and may also be used as tape and label adhesives, and case and carton adhesives, among other uses. The multipurpose hot melt adhesive compositions according to this embodiment have a high level of creep resistance, high bond strength, and relatively low viscosity. Such hot melt adhesives may be applied to substrates using a variety of application techniques. Examples includes hot melt glue gun, hot melt slot-die coating, hot melt wheel coating, hot melt roller coating, melt blown coating, spiral spray and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the hot melt adhesive is sprayed onto a substrate using spiral spray, which is a preferred technique to produce a filamentary spiral pattern for elastic attachment and construction in diaper manufacturing. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a hot melt adhesive comprises: the triblock copolymer described above; the silane-modified, moisture curable polymer made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a siloxide; the polyurethane made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diisocyanate; or the (co)polyester made reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diacid or a diester. Similarly, in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a pressure sensitive adhesive, which is tacky at room temperature, comprises: the triblock copolymer described above; the silane-modified, moisture curable polymer made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a siloxide; the polyurethane made from reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diisocyanate; or the (co)polyester made reacting a macromolecule of the present invention which is a diol with a diacid or a diester. Such adhesives may further comprise a tackifier, a plasticizer, and, optionally, other additives. Such additives may include, for example, such materials as ultraviolet light (UV) absorbers, waxes, surfactants, inert colorants, titanium dioxide, fluorescing agents and fillers. Typical fillers include talc, calcium carbonate, clay silica, mica, wollastonite, feldspar, aluminum silicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, glass microspheres, ceramic microspheres, thermoplastic microspheres, baryte and wood flour and may be included in an amount up to 60% by weight, and preferably between 1 and 50% by weight. Embodiments of the invention that use a monomer of Formula I, which is a four-membered ring, would have a higher degree of ester groups along the backbone than macromolecules made from higher lactones, such as a seven-membered ring or higher. Accordingly, an effect of embodiments of the invention is to provide a greater degradation rate because of the higher degree of ester groups along the backbone, and this may be done without unduly compromising adhesive or cohesive strength. Without being bound to any theory, this effect may be due to the increased Van der Waal's forces capable of bonding with substrates, which is also enhanced by having a long-chain alkyl substitution. Embodiments of the present invention would have one long-chain alkyl substituent for every four atoms along the backbone, whereas the macromolecules made from higher lactones (e.g., seven-membered rings) would have only one long-chain alkyl substituent for every seven atoms along the backgone. Embodiments of the invention are directed to macromolecules made from a monomer of formula I and one or both of monomers of formula II or III. The inclusion of one or two comonomers enables the production of macromolecules having a wider range of melting points and glass transition temperatures so that a more diverse range of macromolecules can be made in accordance with this invention. Consequently, adhesives having a wider range of properties can be made in accordance with this invention. In particular, the ratio of the higher lactone comonomer of formula III to the β-lactone monomer of formula I can be altered to change the melting point and glass transition temperature of the co-polymerized macromolecule relative to the respective individual homopolymers. In addition, macromolecules of the present invention have a long-chain alkyl substituent. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that such long-chain alkyl substituents better break up regions of crystallinity to provide a more rubbery macromolecule. When such a macromolecule is used as the mid-block of relatively stiffer end blocks in an ABA pattern, the resulting block copolymer has properties which simulate the properties of many styrene block copolymers used in hot melt adhesives but are not sourced from petroleum fuel and may be compostable if properly formulated.

BACKGROUND Hydrogel is a material with a three-dimensional network structure formed by certain crosslinking. Hydrogel is widely applied in the biomedical field, due to its physical and chemical properties similar to extracellular matrix as well as good biocompatibility. Polyethylene glycol is a common raw material for preparing hydrogel, including linear polyethylene glycol and multi-arm polyethylene glycol. Due to the low reactivity of the terminal hydroxyl of the polyethylene glycol, it is usually necessary to derivatize polyethylene glycol to produce terminal groups with different functions, such as carboxy, amino, mercapto, and aldehyde groups. Through the chemical reaction of the terminal group, a chemically cross-linked hydrogel can be conveniently prepared, and the hydrogel can also be functionalized by coupling other molecules. The prior art discloses a variety of polyethylene glycol hydrogels, such as polyethylene glycol hydrogel through the reaction of aldehyde group and amino group and polyethylene glycol hydrogel through enzymatic crosslinking reactions. However, the polyethylene glycol hydrogel prepared by the prior art has a slow gel-forming speed, poor stability, low mechanical strength, and the need to add toxic catalysts and other defects that limit its application in the biomedical field.

BACKGROUND ART In recent years, there have been demands for highly functional polymer material, in developing electronic devices such as liquid crystal display, organic electroluminescence (EL) element (organic EL display and organic EL lighting), touch panel, optical semiconductor (LED) element, solid-state image sensor, organic thin-film solar cell, dye-sensitized solar cell, and organic thin-film transistor (TFT). Specific properties required therefor include 1) heat resistance, 2) transparency, 3) high refractive index, 4) high solubility, 5) low volume shrinkage, 6) hot-humid resistance, and 7) high film hardness. In this regard, the present applicant has already found that a polymer that contains a repeating unit having a triazine ring and an aromatic ring demonstrates a high refractive index; that such polymer can achieve, solely by itself, high heat resistance, high transparency, high refractive index, high solubility, and low volume shrinkage; and that the polymer is therefore suitable for a film-forming composition when manufacturing the electronic devices (Patent Literature 1). A planarization layer or a light scattering layer, for example, of the organic EL lighting has been formed usually by coating, with use of a composition prepared by dissolving a high refractive index material in an organic solvent, occasionally prohibiting use of a high polarity solvent on some sort of transparent electroconductive film. Another problem can arise when coating a film-forming composition that contains a high refractive index polymer with use of a coater, occasionally followed by line cleaning of the device with use a low-polarity solvent, the line would be clogged if the polymer is less soluble to such solvent. Furthermore, when exposing the film to the solvent during manufacture of the electronic device, the formed film would get cracks under some condition, calling for further improvement in the durability.

Among them, polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound is preferred from the viewpoint of capability of suppressing decrease in the refractive index due to blending of the crosslinking agent, and of allowing rapid progress of the curing reaction, and in particular, polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound, shown below, having an isocyanuric acid skeleton is more preferred for its excellence in compatibility with the triazine ring-containing polymer. The polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound having such skeleton is exemplified by NK Ester A-9300 and NK Ester A-9300-1CL (both from Shin-Nakamura Chemical Co., Ltd.). wherein each of R 111 to R 113 independently represents a monovalent organic group having at least one (meth)acrylic group at the terminal. Also from the viewpoint of further improving the curing rate, and enhancing the solvent resistance, acid resistance, and alkali resistance of the obtainable cured film, it is preferred to use polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound that exists in a liquid form at 25° C., and has a viscosity of 5,000 mPa·s or lower, preferably 1 to 3,000 mPa·s, more preferably 1 to 1,000 mPa·s, and even more preferably 1 to 500 mPa s (referred to as low viscosity crosslinking agent, hereinafter) independently, or by combining two or more kinds of them, or by combining it with the aforementioned polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound having an isocyanuric acid skeleton. Also this sort of low-viscosity crosslinking agent is commercially available, and from among the aforementioned polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compounds, typically exemplified are crosslinking agents having a relatively long chain between (meth)acrylic groups, such as NK ester A-GLY-3E (85 mPa·s, 25° C.), A-GLY-9E (95 mPa·s, 25° C.), A-GLY-20E (200 mPa·s, 25° C.), A-TMPT-3EO (60 mPa·s, 25° C.), A-TMPT-9EO, ATM-4E (150 mPa·s, 25° C.), and ATM-35E (350 mPa·s, 25° C.) (all from Shin-Nakamura Chemical Co., Ltd.). In further consideration of also improving the alkali resistance of the obtainable cured film, preferred is use of at least either NK ester A-GLY-20E (from Shin Nakamura Chemical Co., Ltd.) or ATM-35E (from Shin Nakamura Chemical Co., Ltd.), in combination with the polyfunctional (meth)acrylic compound having an isocyanuric acid skeleton. In an additional case where a film formed of the triazine ring-containing polymer of the present invention is stacked on a protective film typically formed of PET or polyolefin and intended for photo-irradiation through the protective film, good curability of the film stacked film is obtainable without being affected by oxygen inhibition. Since the protective film needs to be peeled off after the curing, so that preferred is use of polybasic acid-modified acrylic oligomer that gives an easy-peel film. The aforementioned crosslinking agents may be used independently, or by combining two or more kinds of them. The amount of consumption of the crosslinking agent is preferably 1 to 100 parts, per 100 parts by mass of the triazine ring-containing polymer, wherein considering the solvent resistance, the lower limit thereof is preferably 2 parts by mass, and more preferably 5 parts by mass, meanwhile again considering controllability of the refractive index, the upper limit thereof is preferably 20 parts by mass, and more preferably 15 parts by mass. The composition of the present invention may also be blended with an initiator suited to each crosslinking agent.

Also conditions for photo-irradiation are not specifically limited, for which any appropriate energy and time of irradiation are used, depending on the triazine ring-containing polymer and the crosslinking agent to be employed.

With use of such SP-4 solution, a cured film (referred to as SP-4 film, hereinafter) was obtained according to the same procedure as in Example 2-1. Comparative Example 2-2 P-5 (2.50 g) obtained in Comparative Example 1-2 was dissolved in CPN (5.83 g), to which 0.71 g of blocked isocyanate (BI7992, 1,500 mPa·s, from Baxenden Chemicals, Ltd.), as a crosslinking agent, in the form of 70% by mass solution in PGME (propylene glycol monomethyl ether), 0.25 g of surfactant Megaface R-40 (from DIC Corporation) in the form of 1% by mass solution in CPNA, and 9.76 g of CPN were added, whose solubilization was visually confirmed, whereby a varnish having a solid content of 15% by mass (referred to as SP-5 solution, hereinafter) was prepared.

[Measurement of Solvent Resistance (Crack Resistance) and Transmittance] The substrate with the cured film formed above was set on a spin coater, and thereon 1 ml of CPN was coated. Next, the cured film was exposed to the solvent under rotation at 50 rpm for 60 seconds, while preventing the liquid from being scattered from the substrate. The substrate was then rotated at 1,000 rpm for 30 seconds to spin off the solvent. The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 120° C. for 10 seconds, and subjected to measurement of the refractive index, film thickness, estimation of residual film ratio, and observation of the film surface under an optical microscope. The residual film ratio was estimated by the equation below. Residual film ratio (%)=[(Film thickness after solvent exposure)/(Film thickness before solvent exposure)]×100 Also the transmittance was measured before solvent exposure. Measured results of the refractive index, film thickness, residual film ratio, and average transmittance at 300 to 800 nm are summarized in Table 1, micrographs of the surfaces of the cured films in Examples 2-1 to 2-3 are shown in FIGS. 7 to 9 , and micrographs of the surfaces of the cured films in Comparative Examples 2-1 and 2-2 are shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 .

In contrast, the cured film in Comparative Example 2-1 (SP-4 film) was found to cause surface roughness and crack after exposed to the solvent and dried on a hot plate at 120° C. for 10 seconds (see FIG. 10 ), and was not in a condition suitable for measurement of the refractive index and thickness. The cured film (SP-5 film) in Comparative Example 2-2 was found to cause no surface roughness and crack, but was found to be lowered in the transmittance than in Examples (see FIG. 11 ). These results teach that the cured films formed of the polymer compounds in Examples excel in solvent resistance (crack resistance) and optical properties, by virtue of the crosslinking moiety at the polymer terminal. [Example 3-1] Synthesis of Polymer Compound [15] Into a 3,000 mL four-necked flask, placed were 2,2′-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diamine diphenyl ether [12](218.79 g, 0.651 mol, from Wuhan Sun-shine Chemical Co., Ltd.) and 1,693.96 g of dimethylacetamide (DMAc, from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.), the inside of the flask was replaced with nitrogen, and the content was stirred to dissolve 2,2′-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4′-diamine diphenyl ether [12] in DMAc. The content was then cooled on an ethanol-dry ice bath down to −10° C., to which 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine [11] (120.00 g, 0.651 mol, f rom Amino-Chem (HK) Co., Ltd.) was added while monitoring so that the internal temperature would not reach or exceed 0° C. After 30-minute stirring the reaction liquid, 1,693.96 g of DMAc was added to a 5,000 mL four-necked flask in advance, and after nitrogen replacement and after setting the oil bath at 90 to 100° C., the reaction liquid was added dropwise into the 5,000 mL four-necked flask, while keeping the internal temperature at 75° C.±5° C.

The content was then cooled down to room temperature, to which n-propylamine (115.39 g, from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was added dropwise, the content was stirred for 30 minutes, and the stirring was stopped. THF (2,051 g), ammonium acetate (1,846 g) and ion-exchanged water (1,846 g) were added to the reaction liquid, and the content was stirred for 30 minutes. After stopping the stirring, the liquid was transferred to a separating funnel, separated into an organic layer and an aqueous layer, and the organic layer was collected. The collected organic layer was added dropwise to a mixed solution of methanol (3,282 g) and ion-exchanged water (8,206 g), to cause reprecipitation.

The content was then heated so as to elevate the inner temperature to 60° C., to which 15.0 g of 2-isocyanatoethyl acrylate (Karenz AOI, from Showa Denko K.K.) was added, and the content was stirred for 3 hours. Then, after cooling down to room temperature, the reaction liquid was added dropwise into a mixed solution of methanol (158 g) and ion-exchanged water (396 g), to cause reprecipitation. The resulted precipitate was collected by filtration, and dried in a vacuum dryer at 80° C. for 8 hours, to obtain 16.8 g of a desired polymer compound [16](referred to as P-12, hereinafter).

The weight average molecular weight Mw of the compound P-13 in terms of polystyrene-equivalent value, measured by GPC, was found to be 11,580, and the polydispersity Mw/Mn was found to be 3.7. Example 4-1 P-11 (2.50 g) obtained in Example 3-1 was dissolved in PGME (5.83 g), to which 0.71 g of blocked isocyanate (BI7992, 1,500 mPa·s, from Baxenden Chemicals, Ltd.), as a crosslinking agent, in the form of 70% by mass solution in PGME, 0.25 g of surfactant Megaface F-563 (from DIC Corporation) in the form of 1% by mass solution in PGMEA, 0.71 g of PGME, and 1.70 g of THFA (tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol) were added, whose solubilization was visually confirmed, whereby a varnish having a solid content of 30% by mass (referred to as SP-11 solution, hereinafter) was prepared.

TABLE 2 Comparative Example Example 4-1 4-1 Refractive index 1.62 Measurement not (@550 nm) possible Thickness 3,880 (nm) b* 0.48 As summarized in Table 2, the film in Comparative Example 4-1 was found to be thick, and cracked upon being obtained as a cured film (SP-12 film) due to absence of the crosslinking moiety in the compound P-13 (see FIG. 16 ), so that optical properties could not be measured. In contrast, the cured film (SP-11 film) in Example 4-1 was found to excel in crack resistance, while keeping high refractive index and high transparency, despite large thickness (see FIG. 15 ).

TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to the technical field of polymer chemistry and material science, and in particular to a thiocarbonyl-based poly(O-thiocarbamate) compound and a preparation method and use thereof. BACKGROUND ART Animals and plants in nature, including human beings, are composed of polymers as important components. Human production and life are inseparable from polymers. Therefore, in just a few decades, polymer science has developed rapidly and formed an independent and important discipline. In recent years, more and more researchers have devoted themselves to the exploration of new polymers and the preparation methods thereof in order to provide a steady and continuous power for the development of new materials. Sulfur, the second most abundant element in fossil fuels after carbon, is often used in the preparation of vulcanized rubber, pesticides and sulfuric acid. Elemental sulfur exists in the form of an eight-membered ring at room temperature, with a melting point of 112.8° C. In terms of polymer synthesis, the reactions involving elemental sulfur usually require high temperature conditions, and the resulting polymers are often insoluble cross-linked products, which are difficult to be characterized and processed. Therefore, the application of elemental sulfur in polymer synthesis faces limitations and challenges. Nevertheless, at the same time, sulfur has a high molar refractive index, so that sulfur-containing polymers can have a high refractive index, and play an important role in the development of new optical materials. Therefore, the difficulty of applying elemental sulfur to polymer synthesis needs to be resolved urgently.

The bonding resin is useful for example in the manufacture of laminates, mineral wool insulation and wood products such as plywood, oriented strandboard (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density fiberboards (HDF), parquet flooring, curved plywood, veneered particleboards, veneered MDF or particle boards. The bonding resin is also useful for example in composites, molding compounds and foundry applications. BACKGROUND Lignin, an aromatic polymer is a major constituent in e.g. wood, being the most abundant carbon source on Earth second only to cellulose. In recent years, with development and commercialization of technologies to extract lignin in a highly purified, solid and particularized form from the pulp-making process, it has attracted significant attention as a possible renewable substitute to primarily aromatic chemical precursors currently sourced from the petrochemical industry. Lignin, being a polyaromatic network has been extensively investigated as a suitable substitute for phenol during production of phenol-formaldehyde adhesives. These are used during manufacturing of laminate and structural wood products such as plywood, oriented strand board and fiberboard. During synthesis of such adhesives, phenol, which may be partially replaced by lignin, is reacted with formaldehyde in the presence of either basic or acidic catalyst to form a highly cross-linked aromatic resins termed novolacs (when utilizing acidic catalysts) or resoles (when utilizing basic catalysts). Currently, only limited amounts of the phenol can be replaced by lignin due to the lower reactivity of lignin. One problem when preparing resins comprising lignin is the use of formaldehyde, when the lignin is used in formaldehyde-containing resins, such as lignin-phenol-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde based resins emit formaldehyde, which is a toxic volatile organic compound. The present and proposed legislation directed to the lowering or elimination of formaldehyde emissions have led to the development of formaldehyde free resin for wood adhesive applications. Jingxian Li R. et al. (Green Chemistry, 2018, 20, 1459-1466) describes preparation of a resin comprising glycerol diglycidyl ether and lignin, wherein the lignin is provided in solid form. One problem with the technology described in the article is a long pressing time and high pressing temperature. The 3 plies plywood sample was pressed at 150° C. temperature for 15 minutes to fully cure the resins. Engelmann G. and Ganster J. (Holzforschung, 2014, 68, 435-446) describes preparation of a biobased epoxy resin with low molecular weight kraft lignin and pyrogallol, wherein the lignin component consists of an acetone extraction from Kraft lignin. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now surprisingly been found that it is possible to easily prepare a bonding resin in which the use of formaldehyde can be avoided. It has also been found that an improved bonding resin can be achieved by providing lignin in the form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base. By providing the lignin in the form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base, the step of milling of lignin particles can be avoided, avoiding lignin lump formation and the use of dispersing agent. It has been found that when lignin is provided in form of an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or organic base, the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin structure are deprotonated and free to react with the epoxide groups. This improves the reactivity and performance of the binder. Therefore, providing the lignin in the form of a an aqueous solution comprising ammonia and/or an organic base speeds up the reaction significantly and hence reduces the pressing time and enables the use of a lower pressing temperature for curing the bonding resin, when manufacturing for example laminates, mineral wool insulation, glass wool insulation and wood products such as plywood, oriented strandboard (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density fiberboards (HDF), parquet flooring, curved plywood, veneered particleboards, veneered MDF or particle boards. The bonding resin is also useful for example in composites, molding compounds and foundry applications. Furthermore, by providing lignin in the form an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base the risk of degrading for example glass wool and mineral wool fibers is minimized. The present invention is thus directed to a method for preparing a bonding resin, wherein an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is mixed with one or more crosslinker selected from glycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether, glycerol triglycidyl ether, sorbitol polyglycidyl ether, alkoxylated glycerol polyglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane diglycidyl ether, polyoxypropylene glycol diglycidylether, polyoxypropylene glycol triglycidyl ether, diglycidylether of cyclohexane dimethanol, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, isosorbide diglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 2-9 ethylene glycol units, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 1-5 propylene glycol units, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ether of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ester of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-ether or diglycidyl ester of salicylic acid, vanillic acid, or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, an epoxidized or glycidyl substituted plant-based phenolic compound (such as tannin, cardanol, cardol, anacardic acid) or epoxidized plant-based oil (such as rapeseed oil, linseed oil, soy bean oil), tris(4-hydroxyphenyl) methane triglycidyl ether, N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, p-(2,3-epoxypropoxy-N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, diglycidyl ether of bis-hydroxymethylfuran, and/or diglycidyl ether of terminal diol having a linear carbon chain of 3-6 carbon atoms, and a crosslinker having functional groups selected from glycidyl amine, diglycidyl amine, triglycidyl amine, polyglycidyl amine, glycidyl amide, diglycidyl amide, triglycidyl amide, polyglycidyl amide, glycidyl ester, diglycidyl ester, triglycidyl ester, polyglycidyl ester, glycidyl azide, diglycidyl azide, triglycidyl azide, polyglycidyl azide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl methacrylate, triglycidyl methacrylate, or polyglycidyl methacrylate. One aspect of the present invention is a method for preparing a bonding resin, wherein an aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is mixed with one or more cross-linkers and/or one or more glycidyl ethers, wherein the cross-linker has an epoxy index above 4 eq/kg. The epoxy index can be determined according to ISO 3001. Preferably, the cross-linker has an epoxy index above 5 eq/kg. The cross-linker is an aliphatic or, preferably, aromatic glycidyl ether. Preferably, the cross-linker is aliphatic. The glycidyl ethers may be polyfunctional epoxides and the method according to the present invention may use a mixture of epoxides, such as monofunctional, di-functional, tri-functional and/or tetra-functional. The present invention is thus also directed to the bonding resin obtainable using the method described herein and to the use of the bonding resin in the manufacture of laminates, mineral wool insulation and wood products such as plywood, oriented strandboard (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density fiberboards (HDF), parquet flooring, curved plywood, veneered particleboards, veneered MDF or particle boards. The present invention is also directed to such laminates, mineral wool insulation and wood products such as plywood, oriented strandboard (OSB), laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fiberboards (MDF), high density fiberboards (HDF), parquet flooring, curved plywood, veneered particleboards, veneered MDF or particle boards manufactured using the bonding resin. The bonding resin according to the present invention may also be used in the manufacture of composites, molding compounds and foundry applications. DETAILED DESCRIPTION It is intended throughout the present description that the expression “lignin” embraces any kind of lignin, e.g. lignin originated from hardwood, softwood or annular plants. Preferably the lignin is an alkaline lignin generated in e.g. the Kraft process. Preferably, the lignin has been purified or isolated before being used in the process according to the present invention. The lignin may be isolated from black liquor and optionally be further purified before being used in the process according to the present invention. The purification is typically such that the purity of the lignin is at least 90%, preferably at least 95%. Thus, the lignin used according to the method of the present invention preferably contains less than 10%, preferably less than 5% impurities. The lignin may then be separated from the black liquor by using the process disclosed in WO2006031175. The lignin may then be separated from the black liquor by using the process referred to as the LignoBoost process. The lignin may be provided in the form of particles, such as particles having an average particle size of from 50 micrometers to 500 micrometers. The glycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol diglycidyl ether, polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether, glycerol triglycidyl ether, sorbitol polyglycidyl ether, alkoxylated glycerol polyglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane diglycidyl ether, polyoxypropylene glycol diglycidylether, polyoxypropylene glycol triglycidyl ether, diglycidylether of cyclohexane dimethanol, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, isosorbide diglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraglycidyl ether, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 2-9 ethylene glycol units, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether having 1-5 propylene glycol units, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ether of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-, triglycidyl- or polyglycidyl-ester of a carbohydrate, diglycidyl-ether or diglycidyl ester of salicylic acid, vanillic acid, or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, an epoxidized or glycidyl substituted plant-based phenolic compound (such as tannin, cardanol, cardol, anacardic acid) or epoxidized plant-based oil (such as rapeseed oil, linseed oil, soy bean oil), tris(4-hydroxyphenyl) methane triglycidyl ether, N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, p-(2,3-epoxypropoxy-N,N-bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)aniline, diglycidyl ether of bis-hydroxymethylfuran, and/or diglycidyl ether of terminal diol having a linear carbon chain of 3-6 carbon atoms, and a crosslinker having functional groups selected from glycidyl amine, diglycidyl amine, triglycidyl amine, polyglycidyl amine, glycidyl amide, diglycidyl amide, triglycidyl amide, polyglycidyl amide, glycidyl ester, diglycidyl ester, triglycidyl ester, polyglycidyl ester, glycidyl azide, diglycidyl azide, triglycidyl azide, polyglycidyl azide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl methacrylate, triglycidyl methacrylate, or polyglycidyl methacrylate used according to the present invention acts as a cross-linker. Glycidyl ethers with more functional epoxide groups can be used such as glycerol diglycidyl ether, glycerol triglycidyl ether and sorbitol polyglycidyl ether. Other glycidyl ethers having two to nine alkylene glycol groups (such as 2-4 alkylene glycol groups or 2-6 alkylene glycol groups) can be used, such as diethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, triethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, dipropylene glycol diglycidyl ether and tripropylene diglycidyl ether. As the chain lengths between two glycidyl ether groups gets longer, the resin becomes more flexible, which may negatively influence its performance. It results in an adhesive during curing. Other suitable crosslinkers include crosslinkers having functional groups selected from glycidyl amine, diglycidyl amine, triglycidyl amine, polyglycidyl amine, glycidyl amide, diglycidyl amide, triglycidyl amide, polyglycidyl amide, glycidyl ester, diglycidyl ester, triglycidyl ester, polyglycidyl ester, glycidyl azide, diglycidyl azide, triglycidyl azide, polyglycidyl azide, glycidyl methacrylate, diglycidyl methacrylate, triglycidyl methacrylate and polyglycidyl methacrylate. Typically, the bonding resin according to the present invention is and applied to the surfaces of for example veneers, such as in the manufacture of plywood. When the veneers are pressed together under heating, the cross-linking in the bonding resin takes place, resulting in an adhesive. An aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base can be prepared by methods known in the art, such as by mixing lignin and ammonia and/or organic base with water.

The amount of lignin in the bonding resin is preferably from 5 wt-% to 50 wt-%, calculated as the dry weight of lignin and the total weight of the bonding resin. The bonding resin may also comprise additives, such as urea, tannin, surfactants, dispersing agents and fillers. The bonding resin may also comprise plasticizer. As used herein, the term “plasticizer” refers to an agent that, when added to lignin, makes the lignin softer and more flexible, to increase its plasticity by lowering the glass transition temperature (Tg) and improve its flow behavior.

The weight ratio between plasticizer and lignin, calculated on the basis of dry weight of each component, is from 0.1:10 to 10:1. Preferably, the weight ratio between plasticizer and lignin, calculated on the basis of dry weight of each component, is from 0.1:10 to 10:10, such as from 1:10 to 5:10. The bonding resin may also comprise coupling agent. Coupling agents are for example silane-based coupling agents. The amount of urea in the bonding resin can be 0-40% preferably 5-20% calculated as the dry weight of urea and the total weight of the bonding resin. A filler and/or hardener can also be added to the bonding resin. Examples of such fillers and/or hardeners include limestone, cellulose, sodium carbonate, and starch. The reactivity of the lignin with the glycidyl ether can be increased by modifying the lignin by glyoxylation, etherification, esterification or any other method where lignin hydroxyl content or carboxylic content or amine content or thiol content is increased. Preferably, the lignin used according to the present invention is not modified chemically. The aqueous solution of lignin comprising ammonia and/or an organic base is preferably mixed with the glycidyl ether at room temperature, such as at a temperature of from 15° C. to 30° C. The mixing is preferably carried out for about 5 seconds to 2 hours. Preferably, the viscosity of the mixture is monitored during mixing, either continuously or by taking samples and determining the viscosity thereof. In the production of mineral wool insulation, curing of the bonding resin to form an adhesive takes place when the components used for the preparation of the mineral wool insulation are exposed to heating.
